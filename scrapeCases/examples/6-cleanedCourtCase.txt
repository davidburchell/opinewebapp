90 U.S. 77
THE TEUTONIA.
October Term, 1874
1
The pleadings and proofs sufficiently show that the approaching vessels were respectively ignorant of each other's intention as to the course they would pursue; that nothing was done by the officers and crew of the steamer which could enable those in charge of the steamship to ascertain or determine what course the steamer intended to pursue, and that those in charge of the steamer were equally in doubt and uncertainty as to what were the intentions of the steamship.
1
2
The collision occurred between eleven and twelve o'clock at night. The night was dark. Both vessels were in a pretty dense fog just prior to the collision, and inasmuch as they had failed to come to an understanding from the signals given as to what precautions would be necessary to avoid a collision, it was manifest rashness to advance until they could in some way accomplish that object. This is virtually admitted by both parties, as each alleges that they stopped their engines, though it is not possible to credit the statements that they did so, as it is clear that if such orders had been given by both parties and seasonably and effectually executed, the collision would have been avoided. The circumstances disclosed in the testimony satisfy the court that both vessels were under headway when the collision occurred. The contradictory allegations in the libel and answer cannot be reconciled, nor is there anything in the testimony to afford much aid in that direction.
2
3
Great reliance to support the theory that the steamship struck the steamer upon the starboard side is placed by the libellants upon the testimony of a witness employed by them to examine the wrecked steamer some fourteen months after the collision. But the argument for the appellees is that such a theory cannot be supported, as the steamer of the libellants was bound down the river, and it must be admitted that the argument is entitled to weight. Still it is not difficult to see that it may be true if the residue of the libellants' theory is well founded, that the steamship actually attempted to pass up the river between the steamer of the libellants and the eastern shore of the river, as the testimony of the libellants tends strongly to prove.
3
4
Inconsistencies, however, such as these cannot be reconciled with any satisfactory degree of certainty, nor is it necessary to make any such attempt in the case before the court, since, as already said, it is clear in the judgment of the court, that both vessels were under considerable headway when the collision occurred. Those in charge of each of them knew that the other was approaching from the opposite direction, and that their efforts to come to an understanding as to the respective courses they should pursue had been unsuccessful; and they also knew that the night was dark and foggy to such an extent as to render navigation peculiary dangerous.
4
5
Attempt is not made to set up the defence of inevitable accident, nor could it have been successful if it had been set up, as such a defence can only be maintained in a case where neither vessel is in fault. Inevitable accident in the case of a collision is where both parties have endeavored by all means in their power, with due care and a proper display of nautical skill, to prevent its occurrence, or it may result from the darkness of the night if it clearly appears that both parties were without fault from the time the necessity for precaution began to the moment when every opportunity to avoid the danger ceased.
5
6
Precautions must be seasonable in order to be effectual, and if they are not so and a collision ensues in consequence of the delay, it is no defence to allege and prove that nothing could be done at the moment to prevent the disaster, or to allege and prove that the necessity for precautionary measures was not perceived until it was too late to render them availing. Inability to avoid a collision usually exists at the moment it occurs, but it is generally an easy matter, as in this case, to trace the cause to some antecedent omission of duty on the part of one or both of the colliding vessels. Plainly both were in fault in this case in that they continued to advance under headway in a dark night, when those in charge of them knew that there was imminent danger that they would collide. Both vessels having been in fault the rule is that the damages should be divided between the offending vessels.
6
7
DECREE REVERSED, with costs in this court, and the cause is REMANDED with directions to divide the damages found in the District Court, together with the costs in both of the subordinate courts.

8
REVERSAL AND REMAND ACCORDINGLY.

SMYTHE
v.
FISKE.
October Term, 1874
1
A thing may be within the letter of a statute and not within its meaning, and within its meaning, though not within its letter.6 The intention of the lawmaker is the law.
1
2
Revenue laws are to be construed liberally to carry out the purposes of their enactment. Their penal provisions are not penal in the sense that requires a rigidly strict construction.7 Where doubt exists as to the meaning of a statute, the title may be looked to for aid in its construction.8 The pre-existing law, and the reason and purpose of the new enactment are also considerations of great weight.9
2
3
Upon the trial of this case the learned circuit judge held that silk neck-ties were within the last clause of the eighth section of the act of July unless the words 'not otherwise provided for' excluded them from it, and brought them within the acts of Such he instructed the jury was the effect of this negation.
3
4
In his view, those words referred not to the preceding part of the section in which they are found, but to the prior acts specified.
4
5
We agree with him as to the comprehensive character of the previous part of the sentence, if unqualified, but we dissent from his second proposition. To the latter, we think there is a conclusive answer.
5
6
The object of the statute was to increase the duties before imposed upon the things which it embraces. The title and the context alike show this. The preceding part of the section contains a very full enumeration of articles of silk, both manufactured and unmanufactured. It was evidently intended to be exhaustive. The last clause seems to have been added, as it is not unusual in such cases, out of abundant caution, that nothing might escape. Hence, the phrase 'not otherwise provided for,' was interposed, and meant to apply, not to preceding acts which may not have been present to the mind of the draftsman, and to which there was no necessity to recur, but to the preceding enumeration in the same section—which it supplemented.
6
7
The section, thus construing this clause, covers the whole subject of silk, in all its variety of forms. It was complete in itself. There was no need to refer generally or specially to any prior act. If there was conflict, the prior legislation yielded, necessarily, ipso facto to the later.
7
8
All the manufactured articles enumerated in this section of the act of were subjected to a duty of 60 per cent.
8
9
The duty imposed by the acts of per cent.
9
10
Why leave the non-enumerated articles, covered by the act of subject only to this lower rate of duty? Why this distinction? Such a result would, we think, be a solecism, and contrary to the spirit and purpose of the act. It cannot reasonably be supposed that such was the intent of the clause in question.
10
11
This view of the subject fixes the duty upon silk neck-ties at 50 per cent. ad valorem.
11
12
If we had not come to this conclusion, we should hold that the case is controlled by the twentieth section of the act of The provisions of that section first appeared in the second section of the act of September They were re-enacted in the act of and were a permanent part of the customs duty system of the country. They were unaffected by any of the later tariff acts, and were in force when the duty in question was collected.11 Under that section, as applied to the act of the rate of duty would be 60 per cent. instead of 50. But, as we hold that the clause we have considered, of the eighth section of the act of applies, it excludes the operation of the earlier statute.
12
13
The construction we have indicated of these statutes, is that given to them in their practical administration by the Treasury Department ever since their enactment. This, though not controlling, is not without weight, and is entitled to respectful consideration.12
13
14
Our views as to the amount of duty chargeable on the neck-ties in question are corroborated by the following further considerations:
14
15
In the Revised Code of the United States, of June the similitude clause of the act of and the eighth section of the act of are reproduced without change. The provision as to 'articles worn by men,' &c., is also reproduced, but as follows:
15
16
'Articles worn by men, women, or children, of whatever material composed, except silk and linen, made up or made wholly or in part by hand, not otherwise provided for, 35 per cent. ad valorem.'14
16
17
The exceptions mentioned were here for the first time expressly interposed, but it was a legislative declaration that such was the state of the law on the 1st of December, 1873, without the exceptions; and it is necessarily a construction of the last clause of the eighth section of the act of in accordance with that which we have given to it. It was the declared purpose of Congress to collate all the statutes as they were at that date, and not to make any change in their provisions. Obviously these exceptions were intended to remove doubts and misconstruction, which were known to have prevailed to some extent.
17
18
The question whether these neck-ties were either 'scarfs' or 'ready-made clothing,' was submitted to the jury, and they must have found the negative as to both. We have proceeded upon the assumption that this finding was correct. We have no power to review it in this proceeding.
18
19
JUDGMENT REVERSED, and the cause remanded to the Circuit Court with directions to award a venire de novo, and proceed

MAYS
v.
FRITTON.
October Term, 1874
1
In looking into the record we do not find that the question of the jurisdiction of the State courts over Mrs. Fritton's claim, now made in the argument of the learned counsel of the assignees, was anywhere made in the courts below. It does not appear to have been made before the auditor, or before the Supreme Court on appeal. On the contrary, it affirmatively appears that the assignees submitted the question of the title to the fund to both of these courts, and asked its decision in their favor. In the proceeding before the auditor, before the jury passed on the questions of fact, this was the case. After the jury had passed upon them the counsel for the assignees again appeared before the auditor, claiming the fund and insisting that under the findings of the jury Born was an insolvent when he executed the warrant of attorney to Mrs. Fritton; that it was given to secure a prior debt, and was a fraud upon the provisions of the Bankrupt Act.
1
2
So, upon the appeal to the Supreme Court, the same ground was taken.
2
3
In all these instances the assignees submitted the decision of their claims to the State courts, and, in asking those courts to decide in their favor, necessarily asked them to decide the case.
3
4
While the assignees have made sufficient objection to the judgment rendered against them, we nowhere find an objection to the power of the court to render a judgment. An objection that the court has not decided correctly is a very different thing from an objection that the court has no power to decide.
4
5
The present was the case of the foreclosure of a mortgage under the State laws. The disposition of any surplus that might arise from a sale on such mortgage, under a proceeding in the State courts, prim a facie belonged to the State courts. The subject-matter was within their jurisdiction, and under their control. If special circumstances existed which altered that result, it was the duty of the party making such claim to state them and ask a ruling accordingly. Nothing of the kind was done in the present instance.
5
6
To be available here an objection must have been taken in the court below. Unless so taken it will not be heard here. It is not competent to a party to assent to a proceeding in the court below, take his chance of success, and, upon failure, come here and object that the court below had no authority to take the proceeding. This point comes before us at every term and is always decided the same way.2
6
7
We are not called upon, therefore, to decide whether, in a case like the present, the State court having the fund in its possession, was competent to proceed to its distribution, or whether if demand had been made, there having been previous to that time a decree of bankruptcy and the appointment of assignees, the whole subject should have been remitted to the United States court.3
7
8
The assignees contend further, that the judgment below was erroneous for the reason that the judgment of Mrs. Fritton was void under the Bankrupt Act, and that she was not entitled to the fund awarded to her. This is the question and the only question which was litigated by the assignees in the State courts.
8
9
The thirty-ninth section of the Bankrupt Act defines what acts of the debtor afford grounds for declaring him to be a bankrupt upon the petition of his creditor, among which are the following: 'Or who being bankrupt or insolvent. . shall make any payment, gift, grant, sale. . or give any warrant to confess judgment, or procure or suffer his property to be taken on legal process with intent to give a preference to one or more of his creditors.' The Bankrupt court, on the 31st of January, 1868, adjudged that Born had committed some of the acts in this section specified, by reason of which his creditor was entitled to have him declared a bankrupt.
9
10
Whether Mrs. Fritton shall retain this fund or shall lose it, depends upon the thirty-fifth section of the same act. That section enacts that if any person being insolvent or in contemplation of insolvency, and within four months before the filing a petition by or against him, with a view to give a preference, procures his property to be attached or seized on execution, or makes any payment, pledge, transfer, or who shall within six months make any sale, transfer, conveyance, or other disposition of his property to any person having reasonable cause to believe that such person is insolvent, and such payment, &c., is made in fraud of the provisions of this act, the same shall be void and the assignees may recover the property, &c., from the person so to be benefited.
10
11
To authorize the assignees to recover the money or property under this section, it is necessary that he should establish the act of the bankrupt, not only of which he complains, but also that it was done with a view to give a preference over other creditors, and that the other party to the transaction had reasonable cause to believe that such person was insolvent. For a full discussion of the law on this general subject, see the recent case of Wilson v. City Bank.4
11
12
In the case before us, both of these necessary facts have been found against the assignees. In answer to the second inquiry submitted to them, the jury said that Mrs. Fritton had not reasonable cause to believe that Born was insolvent at the time he executed the warrant of attorney. In answer to the further inquiry, they said that this warrant of attorney was not given with a view to a preference over other creditors. The warrant of attorney cannot, therefore, be held void under the thirty-fifth section of the Bankrupt law. That section does not reach it, and as the act of the parties was valid under the statutes of Pennsylvania, there is nothing to impeach its validity.
12
13
We have not the evidence before us, and we must assume that the verdict of the jury is right. The statute assumes that there may be cases where the various acts of conveyance and disposition may be made, which would not amount to giving a preference.
13
14
We are of the opinion that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania was right, and that it should be
14
15
AFFIRMED.

87 U.S. 430
THE MONTELLO.
October Term, 1874
1
This court held in the case of The Daniel Ball,10 that those rivers must be regarded as public navigable rivers in law which are navigable in fact. And they are navigable in fact when they are used, or are susceptible of being used, in their ordinary condition, as highways for commerce, over which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water. And a river is a navigable water of the United States when it forms by itself, or by its connection with other waters, a continued highway over which commerce is, or may be, carried with other States or foreign countries in the customary modes in which such commerce is conducted by water.11 Apply these tests to the case in hand, and we think the question must be answered in the affirmative.
1
2
The Fox River has its source near Portage City, Wisconsin, and flows, in a northeasterly direction, through Lake Winnebago into Green Bay, and thence into Lake Michigan, and by means of a short canal of a mile and a half it is connected at Portage City with the Wisconsin River, which empties into the Mississippi. From its source to Oshkosh the river is frequently spoken of as the 'Upper Fox.' From Lake Winnebago to Green Bay it is called the 'Lower Fox.' There are several rapids and falls in the river, but the obstructions caused by them have been removed by artificial navigation, so that there is now, and has been for several years, uninterrupted water communication for steam vessels of considerable capacity from the Mississippi to Lake Michigan, and thence to the St. Lawrence, through the Wisconsin and Fox Rivers; and steamboats have passed, and are constantly passing, over these rivers with passengers and freight destined to points and places outside of the State of Wisconsin.
2
3
It is said, however, that although the Fox River may now be considered a highway for commerce, over which trade and travel are, or may be, conducted in the ordinary modes of trade and travel on water, it was not so in its natural state, and, therefore, is not a navigable water of the United States within the purview of the decisions referred to.
3
4
It is true, without the improvements by locks, canals, and dams, Fox River, through its entire length, could not be navigated by steamboats or sail vessels, but it is equally true that it formed, in connection with the Wisconsin, one of the earliest and most important channels of communication between the Upper Mississippi and the lakes. It was this route which Marquette and Joliet took in 1673 on their voyage to discover the Mississippi; and the immense fur trade of the Northwest was carried over it for more than a century.12 Smith, in his History of Wisconsin,13 says: 'At this time ( the three great avenues from the St. Lawrence to the Mississippi were, one by the way of the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers, one by way of Chicago, and one by the way of the Miami of the Lakes, when, after crossing the portage of three leagues over the summit level, a shallow stream led into the Wabash and Ohio.' It is, therefore, apparent that it was one of the highways referred to in the Ordinance of and, indeed, among the most favored on account of the short portage between the two rivers. In more modern times, and since the settlement of the country, and before the improvements resulting in an unbroken navigation were undertaken, a large interstate commerce has been successfully carried on through this channel. This was done by means of Durham boats, which were vessels from seventy to one hundred feet in length, with twelve feet beam, and drew when loaded two to two and one-half feet of water. These boats, propelled by animal power, were able to navigate the entire length of Fox River, with the aid of a few portages, and would readily carry a very considerable tonnage.
4
5
In process of time, as Wisconsin advanced in wealth and population, and had a variety of products to exchange for the commodities of sister States and foreign nations, Durham boats were found to be inadequate to the wants of the country, and Congress was appealed to for aid to improve the navigation of the river, so that steam power could be used. This aid was granted, and since the river was improved commerce is carried over it in one of the usual ways in which commerce is conducted on the water at the present day. But commerce is conducted on the water, even at the present day, through other instrumentalities than boats propelled by steam or wind. And, independently of the Ordinance of declaring the 'navigable waters' leading into the Mississippi and St. Lawrence to be 'common highways,' the true test of the navigability of a stream does not depend on the mode by which commerce is, or may be, conducted, nor the difficulties attending navigation. If this were so, the public would be deprived of the use of many of the large rivers of the country over which rafts of lumber of great value are constantly taken to market.
5
6
It would be a narrow rule to hold that in this country, unless a river was capable of being navigated by steam or sail vessels, it could not be treated as a public highway. The capability of use by the public for purposes of transportation and commerce affords the true criterion of the navigability of a river, rather than the extent and manner of that use. If it be capable in its natural state of being used for purposes of commerce, no matter in what mode the commerce may be conducted, it is navigable in fact, and becomes in law a public river or highway. Vessels of any kind that can float upon the water, whether propelled by animal power, by the wind, or by the agency of steam, are, or may become, the mode by which a vast commerce can be conducted, and it would be a mischievous rule that would exclude either in determining the navigability of a river. It is not, however, as Chief Justice Shaw said,14 'every small creek in which a fishing skiff or gunning canoe can be made to float at high water which is deemed navigable, but, in order to give it the character of a navigable stream, it must be generally and commonly useful to some purpose of trade or agriculture.'
6
7
The learned judge of the court below rested his decision against the navigability of the Fox River below the De Pere Rapids chiefly on the ground that there were, before the river was improved, obstructions to an unbroken navigation. This is true, and these obstructions rendered the navigation difficult, and prevented the adoption of the modern agencies by which commerce is conducted. But with these difficulties in the way commerce was successfully carried on, for it is in proof that the products of other States and countries were taken up the river in its natural state from Green Bay to Fort Winnebago, and return cargoes of lead and furs obtained. And the customary mode by which this was done was Durham boats. As early as May, 1838, a regular line of these boats was advertised to run from Green Bay to the Wisconsin portage.15 But there were difficulties in the way of rapid navigation even with Durham boats, and these difficulties are recognized in the Ordinance of for not only were the 'navigable waters' declared free, but also the 'carrying-places' between them, that is, places where boats must be partially or wholly unloaded and their cargoes carried on land to a greater or less distance. Apart from this, however, the rule laid down by the district judge as a test of navigability cannot be adopted, for it would exclude many of the great rivers of the country which were so interrupted by rapids as to require artificial means to enable them to be navigated without break. Indeed, there are but few of our fresh-water rivers which did not originally present serious obstructions to an uninterrupted navigation. In some cases, like the Fox River, they may be so great while they last as to prevent the use of the best instrumentalities for carrying on commerce, but the vital and essential point is whether the natural navigation of the river is such that it affords a channel for useful commerce. If this be so the river is navigable in fact, although its navigation may be encompassed with difficulties by reason of natural barriers, such as rapids and sand-bars.
7
8
The views that we have presented on this subject receive support from the courts of this country that have had occasion to discuss the question of what is a navigable stream.16
8
9
From what has been said, it follows that Fox River is within the rule prescribed by this court in order to determine whether a river is a navigable water of the United States. It has always been navigable in fact, and not only capable of use, but actually used as a highway for commerce, in the only mode in which commerce could be conducted, before the navigation of the river was improved. Since this was done, the valuable trade prosecuted on the river, by the agency of steam, has become of national importance. And emptying, as it does, into Green Bay, it forms a continued highway for interstate commerce. The products of other States and foreign countries, which arrived at Green Bay for points in the interior, were formerly sent forward in Durham boats, and since the completion of the improvements on the river these products are reshipped in a small class of steamboats. It would be strange, indeed, if this difference in the modes of conducting commerce, both of which, at the times they were employed, were adapted to the necessities of navigation, should operate a change upon the national character of the stream.
9
10
Before the Union was formed, and while the French were in possession of the territory, the Wisconsin and Fox Rivers constituted about the only route of trade and travel between the Upper Mississippi and the great lakes. And since the territory belonged to us this route has been regarded of national importance. To preserve the national character of all the rivers leading into the Mississippi and St. Lawrence, and to prevent a monopoly of their waters, was the purpose of the Ordinance of declaring them to be free to the public; and so important was the provision of this ordinance deemed by Congress that it was imposed on Wisconsin as a condition of admission into the Union.
10
11
Congress, also, when the State was admitted, made to it a grant of lands, in order that the Fox and Wisconsin might be united by a canal, their navigation improved, and the rivers made in fact, what nature meant they should be, a great avenue for trade between the Mississippi and Lake Michigan. The grant was accepted, the navigation improved, and the canal constructed. These objects were, however, accomplished by a private corporation chartered for the purpose, which was allowed to charge tolls as a source of profit. The exaction of these tolls created dissatisfaction outside of the State, and Congress, in 1870, in response to memorials on the subject of the importance of these rivers as a channel of commerce between the States, passed an act authorizing the General government to purchase the property, and after it was reimbursed for advances, to reduce the tolls to the lowest point which should be ascertained to be sufficient to operate the works and keep them in repair.17 Although this legislation was not needed to establish the navigability of these rivers, it shows the estimate put by Congress upon them as a medium of communication between the lakes and the Upper Mississippi.
11
12
It results from these views that steamboats navigating the waters of the Fox River are subject to governmental regulation.

HEARNE
v.
MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY.
October Term, 1874
1
The reformation of written contracts for fraud or mistake is an ordinary head of equity jurisdiction. The rules which govern the exercise of this power are founded in good sense and are well settled. Where the agreement as reduced to writing omits or contains terms or stipulations contrary to the common intention of the parties, the instrument will be corrected so as to make it conform to their real intent. The parties will be placed as they would have stood if the mistake had not occurred.1
1
2
The party alleging the mistake must show exactly in what it consists, and the correction that should be made. The evidence must be such as to leave no reasonable doubt upon the mind of the court as to either of these points.2 The mistake must be mutual and common to both parties to the instrument. It must appear that both have done what neither intended.3 A mistake on one side may be a ground for rescinding, but not for reforming, a contract.4 Where the minds of the parties have not met there is no contract, and hence none to be rectified.5
2
3
This jurisdiction is applied, where necessary and proper, to the reformation of contracts of insurance.6
3
4
Here the application was to insure on a charter 'from Liverpool to Cuba, and load for Europe, via Falmouth,' &c. This was indefinite as to Cuba, and may have been regarded by the company as ambiguous. The answer was, as 'requested, we have entered $on charter to port in Cuba, and thence to port of advice and discharge in Europe.' This answer shows clearly two things: (1.) How the company understood the proposition. (2). That they agreed to insure according to that understanding, and not otherwise.
4
5
There was no mistake nor misapprehension on their part. The circumstances show there could be none.
5
6
The correspondence between the parties constituted a preliminary agreement. The answer to Hearne's proposal was plain and explicit. It admitted but of one construction. He was bound carefully to read it, and it is to be presumed he did so. In that event there was as little room for misapprehension on his part as on the part of the company. Such a result was hardly possible. There is nothing in the evidence which tends to show that any occurred. The inference of full and correct knowledge is inevitable. It is as satisfactory to the judicial mind as direct evidence to the same effect would be.
6
7
So far, the complainant's case is as weak in equity as it was at law.
7
8
But it is said there was a usage that vessels going to Cuba might visit at least two ports—one for discharge and the other for reloading. It is insisted that this usage authorized the voyage to Manzanillo; that the voyage was not a deviation; that it in no wise affected the liability of the company in equity; and that hence, the contract of the parties in this particular should be reformed accordingly.
8
9
It is not necessary that the usage relied upon in cases like this should have been communicated or known to the assurers. Lord Mansfield said: 'Every underwriter is presumed to be acquainted with the practice of the trade he insures, and if he does not know it, he ought to inform himself.'7
9
10
Usage is admissible to explain an ambiguity, but it is never received to contradict what is plain in a written contract.8 If the words employed have an established legal meaning, parol evidence that the parties intended to use them in a different sense will be rejected, unless if interpreted according to their legal acceptation, they would be insensible with reference to the context or the extrinsic facts.9 If no such consequence is involved, proof of usage is wholly inadmissible to contradict or in any wise to vary their effect.10 In no case can it be received where it is inconsistent with, or repugnant to, the contract. Otherwise it would not explain, but contradict and change the contract which the parties have made—substituting for it another and different one, which they did not make.11 To establish such inconsistency it is not necessary that it should be excluded in express terms. It is sufficient if it appear that the parties intended to be governed by what is written and not by anything else.12
10
11
The principle of the admission of such testimony is that the court may be placed, in regard to the surrounding circumstances, as nearly as possible in the situation of the parties—the question being, what did they mean by the language they employed?13 What is implied is as effectual as what is expressed.14 The expression and the implication in this case are equally clear. It is expressed that the vessel should proceed to a port in Cuba, and thence to Europe. It is implied that she should visit no other port in Cuba. Expressum facit tacitum cessare. Under these circumstances, usage can have no application, and proof of its existence is inadmissible. But the usage relied upon is not sustained by the evidence.
11
12
It appears that a large proportion of the vessels, perhaps four-fifths, which go laden with coal to Cuba, take on their return cargo elsewhere on the island than at the port of discharge. A few use the same port for both purposes. But the proof is also that the contract in all such cases is expressed according to the intent. There is no proof that where the policy is upon a voyage to one port and back, the vessel may proceed to another port before her return, and that by usage or otherwise, the latter voyage as well as the former shall be deemed to be within the policy.
12
13
Viewing the case in this aspect, we find nothing that would warrant the interposition of a court of equity.
13
14
We are asked, if we decline to reform the contract, to decree the return of the premium. This we cannot do. We regard the case as one of mere deviation. It is essentially of that character. In that class of cases, the law annuls the contract as to the future, and forfeits the premium to the underwriter. Here equity must follow the law. We cannot apply a different rule.

EQUITABLE INSURANCE COMPANY
v.
HEARNE.
October Term, 1874
1
It is not denied that the correspondence between the partise constituted a preliminary agreement. Such clearly was its effect. The policy was intended to put the contract in a more full and formal shape. The assured was bound to read the letters of the company in reply to his own with care. It is to be presumed he did so. He had a right to assume that the policy would accurately conform to the agreement thus made, and to rest confidently in that belief. It is not probable that he scanned the policy with the same vigilance as the letters of the company. They tended to prevent such scrutiny, and, if it were necessary, threw him off his guard.
1
2
The principles upon which a court of equity will exercise the jurisdiction invoked by the appellee were considered in the case which precedes this. What was there said need not be repeated. In this case Hearne's proposition to the company was to insure upon the charter, 'voyage from Liverpool to Cuba, and to Europe vi a Falmouth.' The company's response, as before stated, was: We will insure 'as proposed by you—Europe to Cuba—at 3 1/2 per cent. It is worth something, you know, to cover the risk at port of loading in Cuba.' This is the language of the parties, and it is the essence of the correspondence. Suppose the language of these sentences had been incorporated in the policy in this form: This company hereby insures $upon the charter of the bark Maria Henry, as proposed by the assured, from 'Europe to Cuba and back to Europe, at 3 1/2 per cent. net,'—the premium is enhanced 'to cover the risk at port of loading in Cuba,'—what would have been the legal result? Can it be doubted that the policy would be held to cover alike the voyage to a port of discharge in Cuba, a voyage thence, if necessary, to a port of loading in Cuba, and a voyage from the latter to Europe? The 'port of loading' is the only one mentioned in the letter. It seems to have been uppermost in the mind of the writer. The risk is referred to as a distinct and separate one. The implication is that the port might be one other than the port of unloading. The right to go to both rests upon the same foundation, and it is not more clear as to one than the other. What is implied is as effectual as what is expressed. The intent of the parties, as manifested, is the contract. Upon any other construction the important language as to 'the port of loading' would be insensible and without effect. No other interpretation, we think, can reasonably be given to it.
2
3
In Dickey v. The Baltimore Insurance Co.,1 the policy insured the vessel upon a voyage 'from New York to Barbadoes, and at and from thence to the Island of Trinidad, and at and from Trinidad back to New York.' This court held that the words 'at and from' protected the vessel in sailing from one port to another in Trinidad to take in a part of her cargo. Marshall, Chief Justice, said: 'It is the settled doctrine of the courts of England that insurance at and from an island, such as those in the West Indies, generally insures the vessel while coasting from port to port for the purpose of the voyage insured.' He refers to Bond v. Nutt,2 and to Thellusson v. Fergusson.3 The case of Cruikshank v. Jansen4 is to the same effect. These authorities fully sustain the proposition laid down. We are not aware that their authority has been questioned. They show the just liberality of construction which obtains where contracts of insurance are involved.
3
4
In this controversy the clear terms of the preliminary agreement warranted the court below in overruling the departure from it found in the policy.
4
5
We have examined the case only in the light of its own inherent facts. We have not found it necessary to consider the usage alleged to exist at Liverpool touching voyages in the trade from that port to Cuba. It seems clear to us that the judgment below does not need further support. We, therefore, forbear to remark upon that subject.

v.
GLENN.
October Term, 1874
1
None of the objections to the reading of the deposition go to the testimony of the witness. All of them relate to defects and irregularities which might have been obviated by retaking the deposition. It does not appear that any notice beforehand was given to the counsel of the plaintiffs that they would be made. In such cases the objection must be noted when the deposition is taken, or be presented by a motion to suppress before the trial is begun. The party taking the deposition is entitled to have the question of its admissibility settled in advance. Good faith and due diligence are required on both sides. When such objections, under the circumstances of this case, are withheld until the trial is in progress, they must be regarded as waived, and the deposition should be admitted in evidence. This is demanded by the interests of justice. It is necessary to prevent surprise and the sacrifice of substantial rights. It subjects the other party to no hardship. All that is exacted of him is proper frankness.

CLINKENBEARD ET AL.
v.
UNITED STATES.
October Term, 1874
1
If the facts were as set up in the defence, it is difficult to see how the assessment in this case could have been legal. The distiller, without any fault of his own, but by the omission of the government itself, was prevented from operating his distillery for the first four days for which he was taxed, and his distillery was inactive from an accident, and in charge of a government officer, as prescribed by law, for four other days. He could not, without a breach of law, commence distilling till a storekeeper was assigned him, and he acted in compliance with the law when his distillery was stopped by accident. To charge him with the capacity-tax during those eight days was unjust and oppressive.
1
2
It is suggested by the government counsel that the case does not show that the assessment was upon the capacity of the distillery; that the quantity of material returned by him as actually used during the month may have warranted the assessment. But the offer was to show that the assessment included those eight days, and the declaration charges, as a breach, that Clinkenbeard did not pay the tax assessed upon the aggregate capacity of the distillery for the month in question. So far as appeared the facts set up in defence rendered the assessment clearly illegal.
2
3
But another point raised by the government counsel is that the assessment, not having been appealed from, was res judicata and conclusive, and defendant was precluded from showing the contrary.
3
4
It is true that the Internal Revenue Act of authorizes the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, on appeal to him made, to remit, refund, and pay back all taxes erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,7 and the amended act of July declares that no suit shall be maintained for the recovery of any tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected until such appeal shall have been made, and a decision had.8 The suit thus prohibited is a suit brought by the person taxed to recover back a tax illegally assessed and collected. This is different from the case now under consideration, which is a suit brought by the government for collecting the tax, and the person taxed (together with his sureties) is defendant instead of plaintiff. No statute is cited to show that he cannot, when thus sued, set up the defence that the tax was illegally assessed, although he may not have appealed to the commissioner.
4
5
Is he precluded by any general rule of law from setting up such a defence? Has an assessment of a tax so far the force and effect of a judicial sentence that it cannot be attacked collaterally, but only by some direct proceeding, such as an appeal or certiorari, for setting it aside?
5
6
It is undoubtedly true that the decisions of an assessor or board of assessors, like those of all other administrative commissioners, are of a quasi judicial character, and cannot be questioned collaterally when made within the scope of their jurisdiction. But if they assess persons, property, or operations not taxable, such assessment is illegal and cannot form the basis of an action at law for the collection of the tax, however efficacious it may be for the protection of ministerial officers charged with the duty of actual collection by virtue of a regular warrant or authority therefor. When the government elects to resort to the aid of the courts it must abide by the legality of the tax. When it follows the statute its officers have the protection of the statute, and parties must comply with the requirements thereof before they can prosecute as plaintiffs.
6
7
A VENIRE DE NOVO AWARDED.
7
8
Mr. Justice CLIFFORD, with whom concurred Justices SWAYNE, DAVIS, and STRONG, dissenting:
8
9
I dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court in this case because the evidence offered by the distiller to show that the assessment in question covered eight days in which his distillery could not be operated was not an answer to the whole declaration; nor could it be, as the assessment was for a deficiency and covered the regular tax for a whole month.
9
10
Suppose the evidence was admissible, still if it had been admitted it would only have shown that the assessment was excessive in amount, in which state of the case all will agree, I suppose, that the defence must have failed, as the case showed that no appeal had ever been taken to the Secretary of the Treasury, as required by the act of Congress.
10
11
Such must be the rule, else it will follow that nothing can be collected of the taxpayer in any case where the assessment is for an amount greater than that authorized by law, which is a proposition at war with the whole system of Federal taxation.

MARSH
v.
WHITMORE.
October Term, 1874
1
At any rate the claim now presented is a stale one. The complainant does not set forth specifically any grounds which could have constituted impediments to an earlier prosecution of his suit. He does not even inform us when he first became acquainted with his supposed wrongs. His language is that he was not aware of the purchase by the defendant until lately—language altogether too vague to invoke the action of a court of equity. The party, says this court in Badger v. Badger,3 citing from previous decisions, who appeals to the conscience of the chancellor in support of a claim, where there has been laches in prosecuting it, or long acquiescence in the assertion of adverse rights, 'should set forth in his bill specifically what were the impediments to an earlier prosecution of his claim; how he came to be so long ignorant of his rights, and the means used by the respondent to fraudulently keep him in ignorance; and how and when he first came to a knowledge of the matters alleged in his bill; otherwise the chancellor may justly refuse to consider his case, on his own showing, without inquiring whether there is a demurrer or formal plea of the statute of limitations contained in the answer.'

JACKSON
v.
LUDELING.
October Term, 1874
1
APPEAL from the Circuit Court for the District of Louisiana.
1
2
This was a bill in equity filed in the court below by Jackson and many other persons against John T. Ludeling, as a first-named party, and others, his associates, to wit: John Ray, Francis P. Stubbs, Wesley J. Q. Baker, William R. Gordon, Henry M. Bry, Joseph F. McGuire, John A. McGuire, Robert Ray, Joseph P. Crossley, Charles W. Phillips, Robert C. Strother, Christopher H. Dabbs, George C. Waddell, William M. Pincaird, and James U. Horne; and also against the Vicksburg, Shreveport, and Texas Railroad Company.
2
3
The complainants were holders of six hundred and sixty, out of seven hundred and sixty-one, bonds of $each, issued by the said company, and secured by a mortgage upon the railroad and its appurtenances, and upon the franchises and personal effects of the company, together with more than four hundred thousand acres of land. Their bill was filed as well for themselves as for all other bondholders whose situation was similar to theirs. Some of them were also preferred stockholders of the company to a large amount. The mortgage was made by an authentic act on the 1st day of September, A.D. to John Ray, or bearer, to secure the full, faithful, and punctual payment and redemption of each and all the bonds issued under it to any and all the future holders thereof, and to each and every one of them, when the same should become due and payable, together with the interest accruing thereon. The relief sought by the bill was that the mortgage might be declared to be a valid lien upon all the property described therein; that a sale averred to have been made under it in 1866, to the defendant Ludeling and his said associates, be set aside, and the deed made to them by the sheriff be declared to be fraudulent and void; that the defendants might be enjoined against setting up any title under the sale and the deed; prohibited from selling any of the property, rights, and privileges of the railroad company, and required to account for all money received by them on account of the corporation, and that the mortgaged property might be decreed to be sold for the benefit of the bondholders, the preferred and other stockholders. The bill also prayed for the appointment of a receiver and for other relief.
3
4
To the bill and the relief asked, the defence set up was what was alleged to have been a judicial sale of the mortgaged property under executory process at the suit of William R. Gordon, one of the defendants; and the question of importance presented by the record was whether that sale, as against these complainants, extinguished the lien of the mortgage.
4
5
A minor point, one less relied on, related to the effect of a certain 'judgment of homologation'—as it is called in Louisiana—'in a suit of monition,' instituted by the defendants under a statute of Louisiana, passed March and by which judgment the defendants contended that the validity of the sale which the present bill sought to have declared null, was conclusively established and the bill itself barred.
5
6
The court below declared that no fraud had been practiced, and that the sale must stand. It accordingly dismissed the bill.
6
7
Messrs. H. M. Spofford and J. A. Campbell, for the appellants; Mr. W. H. Hunt, contra.
7
8
Mr. Justice STRONG delivered the opinion of the court, stating the facts of the case as they were assumed by the court on the evidence to be, and stating also the statute of Louisiana above referred to.
8
9
The sale under consideration was made under an ex parte order, obtained from a judge in chambers on the 23d of December, 1865, at the suit of Gordon, who described himself as the owner of four of the mortgage bonds, upon which coupons amounting to $were due and unpaid. The petition for the order of sale did not aver that Gordon was the owner or bearer of the mortgage, or that he had any rights therein superior to the rights of any other bondholder for whom the mortgage was a security. It might, perhaps, be doubted, therefore, whether under the law of Louisiana he was in a condition to petition for executory process for a sale of the mortgaged premises, and whether the judge had any authority on his petition to order a sale. No question of this kind, however, is seriously made here, and we proceed to notice at once the manner in which the process was used, the proceedings prior to the sale and at the sale, and the actions and relations of the purchasers. Gordon's petition made no disclosure of the name of any other holder of bonds secured by the mortgage. Ostensibly he sued for himself alone. He asked for no notice, and none was given, of his application to any other bondholder, though there were seven hundred and sixty-one bonds outstanding, held principally in other States. The order of seizure was granted by the judge on the 23d day of December, 1865, but it was not filed in the clerk's office until Saturday, the 30th of that month, late in the afternoon, and on that day the sheriff made a seizure and served a notice thereof upon H. M. Bry, who was then acting as the president of the corporation, and who subsequently became one of the purchasers at the sale. On the 2d of January, 1866, the sheriff advertised the property for sale in one newspaper published in the town of Monroe, and by posting a copy of the advertisement on the church door and another at the door of his office. The sale was appointed for the first Saturday of February, which was the earliest day on which it could be made under the law of the State. By that law the property seized was required to be appraised, and could not be sold for less than two-thirds of its appraised value. It consisted of a railroad about one hundred and ninety miles in length, with numerous water stations, buildings, warehouses, depots, and depot grounds, cars, locomotive engines, wagons, machinery, utensils, bills receivable from numerous promisors, aggregating more than $ unpaid stock subscriptions exceeding $ and a large land grant of several hundred thousand acres , rogether with the franchise of the company. To appraise all this property the appraisers were summoned to meet on February 3d, the day of the sale, at 10 o'clock A.M. They were appointed by Gordon and Bry, both of whom were purchasers at the sale. Obviously it was impossible for the persons appointed to make any fair appraisement at that time. Yet they reported one of all the property at $in legaltender notes, and the sale proceeded. From the sheriff's return as first made, drawn up by John T. Ludeling, Gordon's attorney, and one of the purchasers, the sheriff exacted an illegal and onerous condition. The condition was, that the purchaser should pay cash to pay the interest coupons then due, with credit to meet the immature interest and bonds, and should give bonds, with personal security, for the credit portion of the bid. At the first cry the property was struck off to George M. Branner & Co. for $ but because they failed to pay at once the interest coupons then due and presented, the sheriff immediately set up the property again in bulk, and sold and adjudicated it to John T. Ludeling, John Ray, Francis P. Stubbs, Wesley J. Q. Baker, William R. Gordon, Henry M. Bry, Joseph F. McGuire, John A. McGuire, Robert Ray, Joseph P. Crossley, Charles W. Phillips, Robert C. Strother, Christopher H. Dabbs, George C. Waddell, William M. Pincaird, and James U. Horne, the said John T. Ludeling, having bid in the property for them for the sum of $ and they having complied with the terms of sale by paying the proportional amounts of the several coupons due, which were presented for payment, to wit, $ to William R. Gordon, John T. Ludeling, and James U. Horne, the holders of one hundred and fifty-four bonds, and to F. P. Stubbs $ being the amount due on the coupons he presented for payment. Such was the sheriff's return. Two days afterwards he made a deed to the purchasers.
9
10
Were there nothing more in this case than is narrated by the brief history thus given, which is uncontradicted, it would be difficult to characterize the transactions as anything less than a great wrong perpetrated by the agency of legal forms. The great body of the bondholders could have known nothing of the proceeding to sell the mortgaged property and discharge their lien. Their residence was remote, and the sale was hurried as fast as the forms of law permitted. Not a day was lost. They were not afforded an opportunity to attend and bid at the sale, or pay off Gordon's small claim of $ Neither they nor their trustee were consulted. The sale was made in a village far in the interior. It was advertised in only one local newspaper, and not a day longer than the law required. The appraisement was made at the last moment, and it was obviously intended to facilitate a hasty sale for a nominal price. Onerous and illegal conditions of sale were exacted from other bidders, but not from these purchasers, who paid nothing except to themselves. A property upon which had been expended nearly $ together with a large stock subscription, a large grant of lands, and considerable movable property, was bought for $by the very persons who defeated a sale for a much larger price, and the purchase-money was retained by themselves.
10
11
But to a thorough understanding of the case it is necessary to consider the relation in which many of the purchasers at the sale, who are the present defendants, stood to the complainants, and how far their conduct was consistent with that relation. As we have seen, William R. Gordon, at whose suit the executory process for the sale was ordered, was the holder of four bonds. These he obtained in the month of October, immediately preceding the sale, paying for them $ and by his purchase he became entitled to the security of the mortgage ratably with the holders of the other bonds. In equity he was a quasi owner in common with the other bondholders of whatever rights the mortgage gave. He was not a partner with them, nor strictly a tenant in common, but the relation into which he introduced himself by his purchase imposed upon him some duties. If he actually held the mortgage he held it as a trustee. Whether he did or not, it was a duty which he owed to the other bondholders not to destroy its value. When two or more persons have a common interest in a security, equity will not allow one to appropriate it exclusively to himself, or to impair its worth to the others. Community of interest involves mutual obligation. Admitting, then, that Gordon had a right to make use of the mortgage to enforce the payment of the bonds which he held, he had no right so to use it as to obtain an advantage for himself over the other bondholders. He had no right to employ it as an instrument by which he might become the owner of the property mortgaged at the lowest possible price at which it could be obtained, leaving the bonds held by his associate holders unpaid. His duty, if he used it at all, was to make it producetive of the most that could be obtained for all who were interested in it, and if he sought to make a profit out of it at the expense of those whose rights in it were the same as his own, he was unfaithful to the relation he assumed, and was guilty of fraud. In Gue v. The Tidewater Canal Company,1 it was said by Chief Justice Taney, when delivering the opinion of the court, that 'it would be against the principles of equity to allow a single creditor to destroy a fund to which other creditors had a right to look for payment, and equally against the principles of equity to permit him to destroy the value of the property of the stockholders by dissevering from the franchise property which is essential to its useful existence.'
11
12
If, now, the conduct of Gordon be observed and compared with the relation he sustained to the other mortgage bondholders it will be apparent he was utterly regardless of his duty. Before he sued out the executory process he conceived the scheme of forcing a sale of the mortgaged premises, not for the purpose of paying the debt which was a lien upon them, but for profit that might be made out of the purchase, or, as he represented in substance to one whom he requested to join in his plans, because there 'was a probability of a very decided speculation from the sale.' And in pursuance of this scheme, on the 10th day of January, 1866, only a few days after the executory process was placed in the sheriff's hands, he entered into a written agreement with John T. Ludeling, W. J. Q. Baker, F. P. Stubbs, G. C. Waddell, and John Ray, which had for its object the purchase of the railroad and mortgaged property for the exclusive benefit of the parties to the agreement, with no reference to the other bondholders. By this agreement he placed himself in an antagonistic position to those creditors of the company whose security he was using. Their interest was that the property should bring a full price, but his, under the agreement, was that it should be sold for the lowest price possible. Nor is this all. He himself appointed one of the two appraisers who, on the day of the sale, made an appraisement so obviously inadequate and unfair that it forces a conviction it was made collusively to enable the parties to the agreement to obtain the property at a price nearly nominal. The entire property was appraised at seventy-five thousand dollars. Five hundred and fifty thousand dollars were bid for it (though the bid was rejected), and immediately after it was adjudicated to Gordon and his associates, they were offered for their bid one million of dollars, as testified by the person who made the offer, or six hundred thousand dollars, as admitted by Ludeling, and the offer was rejected. Gordon was also a party to the steps taken by which the sheriff was induced to reject the bid of five hundred and fifty thousand dollars made by Branner & Co., and put the property up for a resale. It is impossible to look at all this without coming to the conclusion that Gordon's conduct was, from beginning to end, a violation of the duty he owed to the other bondholders, a duty growing out of his relation to them, and out of his appropriation of a security in which they had an interest nearly two hundred times greater than his own.
12
13
And the situation of the other defendants is little if any better. John Ray, Joseph F. McGuire, John C. McGuire, Christopher H. Dabbs, Wesley J. Q. Baker, Robert Ray, and Henry M. Bry were directors of the railroad company when the executory process was sued out, and when the sale was made. Bry was the vice-president and acting president, in consequence of the absence of the president, who was in Georgia. Joseph McGuire was the company's secretary and treasurer. All these parties were at hand, residents in or near Monroe. As officers of the company they had the custody and charge of the railroad and all the property of the corporation. And they held it in a very legitimate sense as trustees. Certainly they were the trustees of the stockholders, and also, to a considerable degree, of the bondholders, owners of the mortgage. We do not say they might not have purchased the property at a sale over which they had no control, and made under judicial process adverse to the company. Perhaps they might. But we do say they had no right to join hands with Gordon. They had no right to enter into or participate in a combination, the object of which was to divest the company of its property and obtain it for themselves at a sacrifice, or at the lowest price possible. They had no right to seek their own profit at the expense of the company, its stockholders, or even its bondholders. Such a course was forbidden by their relation to the company. It was their duty, to the extent of their power, to secure for all those whose interests were in their charge the highest possible price for the property which could be obtained for it at the sheriff's sale. They could not rightfully place themselves in a position in which their interests became adverse to those of either the stockholders or bondholders. And this rule was peculiarly applicable to these defendants. On the 11th of October, 1865, only about two and a half months before Gordon instituted his proceedings to effect a sale of the road, the directors had resolved that, 'in pursuance of resolutions passed by a meeting of the stockholders held on October 2d, the president of the company be appointed to make arrangements with any company who, in his judgment, might be able to put the road in repair, which was theretofore in operation, and complete the balance of the road, 'and pay the debts of the company;' and, if such arrangements could be made, that the same be reported to the directors, and upon their approval, that such steps should be taken as might vest the road, its franchises, and other property in such company.' One of the purposes of this resolution was the payment of the debts of the company. How, then, can it be claimed that directors who had thus resolved, in obedience to the instructions of the stockholders, were at liberty to participate in a scheme, the object and effect of which was to divest the company of all its property and franchises without the payment of its debts? How can they be permitted to join hands with those who sought to obtain that property at the lowest price, whose interest it was to have no other bidders than themselves at the sale, and whose action tended to defeat the avowed object of the resolution passed by the directors, as well as to make worthless the security which it was their duty to protect and render in the highest possible degree fruitful?

Having thus noticed the relation in which these defendants stood towards the company, its shareholders, and its bondholders, and some of the duties and disabilities attendant upon that relation, we are prepared to inquire how those duties were performed. It is proved that a combination was formed as early as November by some of these directors to become the purchasers of the property and franchises of the company exclusively for their benefit and the benefit of those whom they might consent to associate with them. A written agreement to that effect was made and signed by John Ray, William S. Parham, and W. J. Q. Baker, both Ray and Baker being then directors. By the agreement John T. Ludeling was appointed the agent of the parties to make the purchase in their name. This was very shortly after the resolution of the board of directors, to which we have called attention, was adopted. The agreement was repugnant to that resolution, which contemplated no disposition of the property which did not provide for the payment of the debts of the company, none that might be for the exclusive advantage of some directors. The agreement was made after Wadley, the president, had left the State and gone to Georgia, where most of the bondholders resided, with a view, if possible, to effect such an arrangement as the resolution of October 11th recommended. There is no direct evidence that at this time these parties were in combination with Gordon to obtain the property for themselves by a hurried sale, conducted with the least possible opportunity for notice of his proceeding to those stockholders and bondholders resident at a distance, who had the greatest interest. But that such a confederacy subsequently existed we think ought to be inferred from what subsequently occurred. Indeed, many facts point to such a combination and can be accounted for only by it.
14
15
On the 10th of January, 1866, Ludeling, Baker, and John Ray entered into another agreement with Gordon, Stubbs, and Waddell, by which, after reciting that proceedings had been instituted to sell the railroad, with the property thereto attached and appertaining, they agreed severally to deposit with Ludeling a sum of money to be used for the purpose of forwarding the interests of the company (i. e., the associated parties) relatively to the railroad and property bought, and that the parties to the agreement should be interested in the stock, shares, and property of the company in the proportion of the amount of money put in by each one, regardless of what the property might have cost. Ludeling was designated to bid for the property, and, should he buy, was required to take the title in the names of the contracting parties and such others as might be necessary to preserve the existence of the Vicksburg, Shreveport, and Texas Railroad Company. No one was permitted to sell out his interest within six months after the purchase without the consent of a majority of the other joint owners or copartners, and after that time, namely, the expiration of the six months, the refusal was given to the company. This agreement was also signed about February by Robert Ray, another director, as he has testified. Thus these directors became avowedly confederates with Gordon to purchase the property and to purchase it for their own benefit. Thus they took a position in which it became their interest that the property should be sold at a low price; that there should be as little competition as possible, and that no efforts should be made to stay the sale, or give any more notice than a formal compliance with the law required. Thus their interests were brought into direct antagonism with the interests of the stockholders and bondholders. Thus they combined to defeat the accomplishment of the arrangement proposed by the resolution of the directors of October It is impossible to regard this combination as anything less than a plain violation of their duty, a breach of the trust reposed in them, and, if not an actual, at least a constructive, fraud.
15
16
The plan proposed by this arrangement, however, was disturbed unexpectedly by the arrival in Monroe of James U. Horne, another director of the company. He appeared in the latter part of January, 1866, shortly before the day of sale, commissioned by the holders of a large number of the mortgage bonds (nearly three hundred) to have the railroad sold and purchased by a trustee or trustees, to be selected by the bondholders and creditors of the company, in which class the preferred shareholders might be placed; a new company to be formed of the purchasers upon a basis to be previously agreed upon and signed by the several interests, the bondholders to be placed in the class of preferred shareholders, and the other creditors and preferred shareholders to have common stock. This plan proposed the extinction of common stock and the creation of a new mortgage for the purpose of repairing and stocking the road. Horne's commission was in writing. On his way to Monroe he met Gordon in New Orleans, and there learned for the first time that proceedings had been instituted to bring the property to sale. Gordon then proposed to him to unite his interests and those of his constituents with those of the party in Monroe, namely, the party that had combined to purchase the property. Upon Horne's arrival at Monroe he had several interviews with Ludeling, and it appears that he endeavored to procure a postponement of the sale, representing that Gordon had consented to such postponement. To this Ludeling replied that Gordon had no authority to make such an offer or consent. Considering that Ludeling was then a party to, and the active agent of, the combination that had been formed, this reply is most remarkable. It shows that the confederacy had then the control of the executory process and of the sale, and that the directors of the company had put themselves in the position of both sellers and buyers of the property they held in trust; for if Gordon had no authority to consent to the postponement of the sale, it must have been because of his arrangements with the directors. But, passing this by, after many propositions, Horne was persuaded by Ludeling, and without any communication with his constituents, to enter into an agreement, which was made on the 2d of February, 1866, one day before the sale. The material part of this agreement was that Gordon, Ludeling, Baker, Stubbs, Waddell, and John Ray, of the first part, and Horne, of the second part, for himself and friends, should club their funds to buy the property of the Vicksburg, Shreveport, and Texas Railroad Company, advertised for sale on the morrow, in partnership, and, if the property should be bought by them, that the party of the first part should own two-thirds, and the party of the second part should own one-third. The agreement reveals apprehension that the sale might be stopped by injunction, or declared null and void. It was signed 'John T. Ludeling, for himself and friends,' and 'J. U. Horne, for himself and friends,' and it is proved that when it was entered into Ludeling was informed of Horne's mission and of the plan he was instructed to carry out.
16
17
It is impossible to characterize this agreement as anything else than fraudulent. Its obvious purpose was to remove competition at the sale. It was a flagrant breach of trust on the part of Horne, and it was a fraud in Ludeling, with knowledge of the trust Horne had undertaken, to persuade him to violate his instructions and sacrifice the interests of his constituents, himself becoming a party to the violation.
17
18
Such were the combinations organized, and such was the object of the combinations, when the day arrived on which the sale had been advertised to be made. This large property was about to be sold for a claim of $ at a village remote from the residence of the great body of those most interested in it. It must have been known that notice of the sale in all probability had not reached those parties. Their agent, sent to protect their interest, had been tampered with and overcome. Not one of the defendants, who were residents at Monroe and directors of the company, who had combined to become purchasers at the sale, and not one of those who subsequently united in the purchase and became directors of the new company, not even Bry himself, the vice-president, had lifted a finger to stay the sale, or, so far as appears, had requested any delay, or had made any effort to prevent the probable sacrifice of the property; and when Mr. Garrett, a lawyer and resident stockholder at Monroe, obtained an injunction against the sale, he was bought off by the payment of $for common stock, confessedly not worth a cent, yet taken at its par value, and he was required to stipulate that he would take no fee from, or in any manner counsel or advise, either directly or indirectly, any person who might desire to attack the sale. This arrangement was negotiated by Baker, and the money was paid by Ludeling. We have already noticed the appraisement made after ten o'clock on the morning of the sale by two persons appointed by Gordon and Bry. Of its character we propose to say little more. Manifestly it had been prepared before the appraisers were selected. It was conveniently low to enable the associates to purchase for a sum almost nominal, and one of the appraisers at least was appointed by a person who had combined with others to become a purchaser, and who was, consequently disqualified from selecting an appraiser, or, certainly, was unfit to make such a selection.
18
19
Everything having been thus prepared the sale proceeded, but the scheme of the associates was at first deranged by the interference of other bidders, Branner & Co., who bid for the property $ more than seven times the amount of the appraisement, and to whom it was first struck off. Then ensued what we must regard as a most remarkable effort to prevent an adjudication to these bidders and an acceptance by the sheriff of their bid. Ludeling, for himself and his associated, and acting as their chief agent, presented one hundred and fifty-four of the mortgage bonds, four of which were Gordon's, one Bry's, and most, if not all, the remainder obtained from Horne, and demanded immediate payment of the past-due coupons. He had no right to make such a demand. He knew the bonds had been placed in Horne's hands for other purposes. He knew that it was a breach of faith in Horne to allow them to be thus used, and a fraud upon their owners thus to use them. Stubbs presented seventy-two coupons taken from other bonds, and also demanded immediate payment. And he had no authority to make such a use of those coupons. They had been placed in his hands for another purpose, which failed, and their owners had directed them to be returned. Bry also had one bond, and he presented it with its coupons. This one bond, with the four of Gordon, were all that there was any authority to present. Yet the confederates, taking advantage of Horne's breach of trust, and of Stubbs's unauthorized act, were enabled to present the coupons of one hundred and fifty-four bonds, and part of the coupons of thirty-six other bonds, for immediate payment. The sheriff joined in the demand, and, because Branner & Co. were unable at once to pay this unauthorized claim, he set up the property again immediately for sale, when it was struck off, on Ludeling's bid of $ to the persons we have named. This was on Saturday, late in the afternoon, and on the Monday next following the sheriff's deed was delivered, but the bidders, though receipting in part to each other, have still in their hands the whole of their bid except $ the amount of costs paid to the sheriff.
19
20
Thus directors of the company, owing duties to its stockholders and creditors, not only combined to obtain the company's property for themselves at a sacrifice, through the formality of a judicial sale, but were active participants in successful efforts to defeat a sale for $in order that they might become the purchasers for $.
20
21
It is impossible to sustain such a transaction. Throughout it was grossly inequitable. That the property was sacrificed by means of an unlawful and widespread combination is abundantly proved, and that the directors who were parties to it, and who became the purchasers, were guilty of an inexcusable violation of confidence reposed in them admits of no doubt. Ludeling, it is true, was not a director, but he was a leading member of the combination and its chief agent to carry out its plans. He knew its purposes. He knew its illegality. He had negotiated the surrender of Horne, with full knowledge of Horne's breach of trust. He assumed the control of Gordon's executory process, and, as we have noticed, when told that Gordon had consented to stay the sale, he declared that Gordon had no power to do it. Indeed, Ludeling appears to have had complete possession of the sheriff. He drew up the sheriff's return, carefully stating in it that all the requirements and formalities of the law had been complied with in the second offering as they had been in the first, and he was, as the evidence shows, most active in defeating an adjudication to Branner & Co. on their large bid.
21
22
The connection of Stubbs and Waddell with the combination we have already sufficiently shown, and it is not claimed that the other defendants, Crossley and Phillips, are anything more than volunteers. They have paid nothing. The sheriff adjudicated the property to them, and his deed was made to them, in common with others, but it is proved that their interest is only nominal, each having had one share given to him. They were introduced to enable the confederates to carry out their scheme. Pincaird, according to his own statement, was a party to the agreement of February between Ludeling and his friends, and Horne and his friends. He was therefore one of the parties to the unlawful combination.
22
23
The defendants can take nothing from such a sale, thus made. Were we to sustain it, we should sanction a great moral and legal wrong, give encouragement to faithlessness to trusts, and confidence reposed, and countenance combinations to wrest by the forms of law from the uninformed and confiding their just rights.
23
24
No words need be expended to show that the defence of the new company, the North Louisiana and Texas Railroad Company, must fall with that of the other defendants. The new company was formed by the purchasers at this illegal and void sale. It was organized while this suit was pending, and it has no other title than that of these purchasers.
24
25
It remains only to consider the effect of the judgment in the monition suit instituted by these defendants on the 21st day of April, 1866. They contend that the judgment of homologation rendered in that suit conclusively establishes the validity of the sale made to them, and bars the present bill. But we think such is not the effect of the judgment. The proceeding to homologate a sheriffs sale is peculiar to Louisiana. It is authorized by an act of the legislature passed March That act authorizes purchasers at a sheriff's sale to apply for a monition to all persons interested who can set up any right, title, or claim to the property described in consequence of any informality in the order or decree, or judgment of the court under which the sale was made, or any irregularity or illegality in the appointment and advertisement in time or manner of sale, or for any other defect whatsoever, to show cause why the sale should not be confirmed and homologated. If no cause be shown, the judgment of confirmation in the case is conclusive upon the world. But conclusive of what? Conclusive that there have been no fatal informalities, or irregularities, or defects; we think of nothing more. The act has relation to mistakes or omissions of the officers of the law. But there is nothing in it which authorizes an inquiry into or an adjudication upon questions of fraud; nothing which concludes the question whether the purchasers have obtained their title by fraud, or whether they are trustees mal a fide for others. And such has been the ruling of the Louisiana courts. In The City Bank v. Walden,3 the court considered the effect and scope of the act. 'It was passed,' they said, 'for the protection of bon a fide purchasers at judicial sales from litigation concerning matters of form, a non-observance of which frequently exposed purchasers to unreasonable and vexatious suits. The difficulty of administering and preserving proofs of the observance of formalities was, in the hands of the unscrupulous, the instrument of great annoyance and expense to those who had purchased and paid for property exposed to sale under the authority of our courts. We do not understand the operation of the act to extend beyond the matters of form, nor that it purports to operate upon matters 'dehors' the record.' This is manifestly the true construction of the statute, and it is quite consistent with the enactment that the judgment of homologation is to be received and considered as 'full and conclusive proof that the sale was duly made according to law, in virtue of a judgment or order legally and regularly pronounced on the interests of the parties duly represented.' Fraud and trust are entirely outside the record. A sale may have been conducted legally in all its process and forms, and yet the purchaser may have been guilty of fraud, or may hold the property as a trustee. In this case the complainants rely upon no irregularity of proceeding, upon no absence of form. The forms of law were scrupulously observed. But they rely upon faithlessness to trusts and common obligations, upon combinations against the policy of the law and fraudulent, and upon confederate and successful efforts to deprive them wrongfully of property in which they had a large interest, for the benefit of persons in whom they had a right to place confidence. Homologation is no obstacle to such a claim.

JUDGMENT REVERSED.
26
27
DECRETAL ORDER.
27
 This cause came on for argument and was argued by counsel. Whereupon, after due consideration, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the decree of the Circuit Court dismissing the bill of the complainants be reversed and set aside, and that the bill be reinstated.
28
 And it is further ordered and decreed and hereby declared, that the mortgage described in the bill, executed to John Ray or bearer, is still a valid lien upon all the property described therein not sold or disposed of by the Vicksburg, Shreveport, and Texas Railroad Company before December and the rights of the holders of bonds bon a fide issued under the mortgage are hereby set up and maintained, and the holders are authorized to prove their bonds under the decree of this court or of the Circuit Court.
29
 And it is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the sale made to John T. Ludeling and his associates, and the adjudication of the sheriff to them, together with the sheriff's deed to them, be declared to be fraudulent and void, and be set aside and cancelled, and that a perpetual injunction issue commanding them and all the defendants to refrain from setting up or claiming any right, title, or interest under said sale or under said deed, and also commanding them, their agents and servants, to refrain from selling or otherwise disposing of any of the property, rights, credits, privileges, or effects covered by or embraced within the mortgage made by the said The Vicksburg, Shreveport, and Texas Railroad Company.
30
 And it is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed that this cause be remitted to the Circuit Court for the District of Louisiana, with instructions to direct an account to be taken of all the property of the said corporation and to appoint a receiver thereof; and, also, to order that the property described or mentioned in the said mortgage be sold, under the direction of that court, for the benefit, first, of all the bon a fide bondholders secured by the mortgage; and, secondly, for the benefit of other creditors of the company and its stockholders, upon such terms as may appear best calculated to promote the interests of all.
31
 And it is further ordered and decreed that the defendants do account for all money and property received by them out of the property so sold to them or any of them, or from its profits or income, receiving in their account such credits as, under the circumstances of the case, by the law of Louisiana, they are entitled to, and that they pay and deliver to the receiver whatever on such accounting may be found due from them.
32
33
And it is ordered and adjudged that the defendants do pay the costs in this court and in the Circuit Court.
