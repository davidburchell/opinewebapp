MALI, Consul of His Majesty the King of the
Belgians, and others
v.
KEEPER OF THE COMMON JAIL OF HUDSON COUNTY, NEW JERSEY.1
January 10, 1887.
1
By sections of the Revised Statutes the courts of the United States have power to issue writs of habeas corpus which shall extend to prisoners in jail when they are in 'custody in violation of the constitution or a law or treaty of the United States,' and the question we have to consider is whether these prisoners are held in violation of the provisions of the existing treaty between the United States and Belgium.

It is part of the law of civillized nations that, when a merchant vessel of one country enters the ports of another for the purposes of trade, it subjects itself to the law of the place to which it goes, unless, by treaty or otherwise, the two countries have come to some different understanding or agreement; for, as was said by Chief Justice MARSHALL in The Exchange, 'It would be obviously inconvenient and dangerous to society, and would subject the laws to continual infraction, and the government to degradation, if such * * * merchants did not owe temporary and local allegiance, and were not amenable to the jurisdiction of the country.' United States v. Diekelman, Phillim. Int. Law, ( § CCCLI.; Twiss, Law Nat. Creasy, Int. Law, Halleck, Int. Law, ( And the English judges have uniformly recognized the rights of the courts of the country of which the port is part to punish crimes committed by one foreigner on another in a foreign merchant ship.

As the owner has voluntarily taken his vessel, for his own private purposes, to a place within the dominion of a government other than his own, and from which he seeks protection during his stay, he owes that government such allegiance, for the time being, as is due for the protection to which he becomes entitled.

From experience, however, it was found long ago that it would be beneficial to commerce if the local government would abstain from interfering with the internal discipline of the ship, and the general regulation of the rights and duties of the officers and crew towards the vessel, or among themselves. And so by comity it came to be generally understood among civilized nations that all matters of discipline, and all things done on board, which affected only the vessel, or those belonging to her, and did not involve the peace or dignity of the country, or the tranquillity of the port, should be left by the local government to be dealt with by the authorities of the nation to which the vessel belonged as the laws of that nation, or the interests of its commerce should require. But, if crimes are committed on board of a character to disturb the peace and tranquillity of the country to which the vessel has been brought, the offenders have never, by comity or usage, been entitled to any exemption from the operation of the local laws for their punishment, if the local tribunals see fit to assert their authority. Such being the general public law on this subject, treaties and conventions have been entered into by nations having commercial intercourse, the purpose of which was to settle and define the rights and duties of the contracting parties with respect to each other in these particulars, and thus prevent the inconvenience that might arise from attempts to exercise conflicting jurisdictions.

The first of these conventions entered into b the United States after the adoption of the constitution was with France, on the fourteenth of Novem-ber, ) 'for the purpose of defining and establishing the functions and privileges of their respective consuls and vice-consuls,' article 8 of which is as follows: 'The consuls or vice-consuls shall exercise police over all the vessels of their respective nations, and shall have on board the said vessels all power and jurisdiction in civil matters in all the disputes which may there arise. They shall have entire inspection over the said vessels, their crew, and the changes and substitutions there to be made, for which purpose they may go on board the said vessels whenever they may judge it necessary. Well understood that the functions hereby allowed shall be confined to the interior of the vessels, and that they shall not take place in any case which shall have any interference with the police of the ports where the said vessels shall be.'

It was when this convention was in force that the cases of The Sally and The Newton arose, an account of which is given is Wheaton's Elements of International Law, (Phillimore's International Law, ( The Sally was an American merchant vessel in the port of Marseilles, and the Newton a vessel of a similar character in the port of Antwerp, then under the dominion of France. In the case of The Sally, the mate, in the alleged exercise of discipline over the crew, had inflicted a severe wound on one of the seamen, and, in that of The Newton, one seaman had made an assault on another seaman in the vessel's boat. In each case the proper consul of the United States claimed exclusive jurisdiction of the offense, and so did the local authorities of the port; but the council of state, a branch of the political department of the government of France to which the matter was referred, pronounced against the local tribunals, 'considering that one of these cases was that of an assault committed in the boat of the American ship Newton by one of the crew upon another, and the other was that of a severe wound inflicted by the mate of the American ship Sally upon one of the seamen for having made use of the boat without leave.' This was clearly because the things done were not such as to disturb 'the peace or tranquillity of the port.' Wheat. Elem. ( The case of The Sally was simply a quarrel between certain of the crew while constructively on board the vessel, and that of The Newton grew out of a punishment inflicted by an officer on one of the crew for disobedience of orders. Both were evidently of a character to affect only the police of the vessel, and thus within the authority expressly granted to the consul by the treaty.

6
No other treaty or convention bearing on this subject, to which our attention has been called, was entered into by the United States until a treaty with Sweden and Norway, on the fourth of September, ) where it was agreed, by article 5, that 'the consuls and their deputies shall have the right, as such, to act as judges and arbitrators in the differences which may arise between the captains and crews of the vessels of the nation whose affairs are intrusted to their care. The respective governments sahll have no right to interfere in matters of this kind, except the conduct of the captain or crew shall disturb the peace and tranquillity of the country in which the vessel may be, or the consul of the place shall feel himself obliged to resort to the interposition and support of the executive authority to cause his decision to be respected and maintained; it being, nevertheless, understood that this kind of judgment or award shall not deprive the contending parties of the right which they have, on their return, to recur to the judicial authorities of their own country.'

7
Substantially the same provision is found in treaties or conventions concluded with Prussia in ) with Russia in ) with Greece in ) with Hanover in ) with Portugal, also in ) with the grand duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in ) with Oldenburg in ) with Austria in ) with the Hanseatic republics in ) with the Two Sicilies in ) with Denmark in ) and with the Dominican republic in )
7
8
In a convention with New Grenada concluded in 1850 the provision was this: 'They [the consuls, etc.] may cause proper order to be maintained on board vessels of their nation, and may decide on disputes arising between the captains, the officers, and the members of the crew, unless the disorders taking place on board should disturb the public tranquillity, or persons not belonging to the crew or the nation in whose service the consul is employed; in which case the local authorities may interfere.' Article )
8
9
Following this was a convention with France, concluded in ) article 8 of which is as follows: 'The respective consuls general, consuls, vice-consuls, or consular agents shall have exclusive charge of the internal order of the merchant vessels of their nation, and shall alone take cognizance of differences which may arise, either at sea or in port, between the captain, officers, and crew, without exception, particularly in reference to the adjustment of wages and the execution of contracts. The local authorities shall not, on any pretext, interfere in these differences, but shall lend forcible aid to the consuls, when they may ask it, to arrest and imprison all persons composing the crew whom they may deem it necessary to confine. Those persons shall be arrested at the sole request of the consuls, addressed in writing to the local authority, and supported by an official extract from the register of the ship or the list of the crew, and shall be held, during the whole time of their stay in the port, at the disposal of the consuls. Their release shall be granted at the mere request of the consuls made in writing. The expenses of the arrest and detention of those persons shall be paid by the consuls.
9
10
The same provision, in substantially the same language, was embraced in a convention with Italy in ) and in another with Belgium, also in ) This convention with Belgium continued in force until superseded by that of under which the present controversy arose.
10
11
The form of the provision found in the present convention with Belgium first appeared in a convention with Austria concluded in ) and it is found now in substantially the same language in all the treaties and conventions which have since been entered into by the United States on the same subject. See the conventions with the German Empire in ) with the Netherlands in ) with Italy in ) with Belgium in 1881, as stated above; and with Roumania, the same year, art. )
11
12
It thus appears that at first provision was made only for giving consuls police authority over the interior of the ship, and jurisdiction in civil matters arising out of disputes or differences on board; that is to say, between those belonging to the vessel. Under this police authority the duties of the consuls were evidently confined to the maintenance of order and discipline on board. This gave them no power to punish for crimes against the peace of the country. In fact, they were expressly prohibited from interfering with the local police in matters of that kind. The cases of The Sally and The Newton are illustrative of this position. That of The Sally related to the discipline of the ship, and that of The Newton to the maintenance of order on board. In neither case was the disturbance of a character to affect the peace or the dignity of the country.
12
13
In the next conventions consuls were simply made judges and arbitrators to settle and adjust differences between those on board. This clearly related to such differences between those belonging to the vessel as are capable of adjustment and settlement by judicial decision or by arbitration, for it simply made the consuls judges or arbitrators in such matters. That would of itself exclude all idea of punishment for crimes against the state which affected the peace and tranquillity of the port; but, to prevent all doubt on this subject, it was expressly provided that it should not apply to differences of that character.
13
14
Next came a form of convention which in terms gave the consuls authority to cause proper order to be maintained on board, and to decide disputes between the officers and crew, but allowed the local authorities to interfere if the disorders taking place on board were of such a nature as to disturb the public tranquillity, and that is substantially all there is in the convention with Belgium which we have now to consider. This treaty is the law which now governs the conduct of the United States and Belgium towards each other in this particular. Each nation has granted to the other such local jurisdiction within its own dominion as may be necessary to maintain order on board a merchant vessel, but has reserved to itself the right to interfere if the disorder on board is of a nature to disturb the public tranquillity.
14
15
The treaty is part of the supreme law of the United States, and has the same force and effect in New Jersey that it is entitled to elsewhere. If it gives the consul of Belgium exclusive jurisdiction over the offense which it is alleged has been committed within the territory of New Jersey, we see no reason why he may not enforce his rights under the treaty by writ of habeas corpus in any proper court of the United States. This being the case, the only important question left for our determination is whether the thing which has been donethe disorder that has arisen on board this vessel is of a nature to disturb the public peace, or, as some writers term it, the 'public repose,' of the people who look to the state of New Jersey for their protection. If the thing done'the disorder,' as it is called in the treatyis of a character to affect those on shore or in the port when it becomes known, the fact that only those on the ship saw it when it was done, is a matter of no moment. Those who are not on the vessel pay no special attention to the mere disputes or quarrels of the seamen while on board, whether they occur under deck or above. Neither do they, as a rule, care for anything done on board which relates only to the discipline of the ship, or to the preservation of order and authority. Not so, however, with crimes which from their gravity awaken a public interest as soon as they become known, and especially those of a character which every civilized nation considers itself bound to provide a severe punishment for when committed within its own jurisdiction. In such cases inquiry is certain to be instituted at once to ascertain how or why the thing was done, and the popular excitement rises or falls as the news spreads, and the facts become known. It is not alone the publicity of the act, or the noise and clamor which attends it, that fixes the nature of the crime, but the act itself. If that is of a character to awaken public interest when it becomes known, it is a 'disorder,' the nature of which is to affect the community at large, and consequently to invoke the power of the local government whose people have been disturbed by what was done. The very nature of such an act is to disturb the quiet of a peaceful community, and to create, in the language of the treaty, a 'disorder' which will 'disturb tranquillity and public order on shore or in the port.' The principle which governs the whole matter is this: Disorders which disturb only the p ace of the ship or those on board are to be dealt with exclusively by the sovereignty of the home of the ship, but those which disturb the public peace may be suppressed, and, if need be, the offenders punished, by the proper authorities of the local jurisdiction. It may not be easy at all times to determine to which of the two jurisdictions a particular act of disorder belongs. Much will undoubtedly depend on the attending circumstances of the particular case, but all must concede that felonious homicide is a subject for the local jurisdiction; and that, if the proper authorities are proceeding with the case in a regular way, the consul has no right to interfere to prevent it. That, according to the petition for the habeas corpus, is this case.
15
16
This is fully in accord with the practice in France, where the government has been quite as liberal towards foreign nations in this particular as any other, and where, as we have seen in the cases of The Sally and The Newton, by a decree of the council of state, representing the political department of the government, the French courts were prevented from exercising jurisdiction. But afterwards, in 1859, in the Case of Jally, the mate of an American merchantman, who had killed one of the crew and severely wounded another on board the ship in the port of Havre, the court of cassation, the highest judicial tribunal of France, upon full consideration, held, while the convention of was in force, that the French courts had rightful jurisdiction, for reasons which sufficiently appear in the following extract from its judgment: 'Considering that it is a principle of the law of nations that every state has jurisdiction throughout its territory; considering that, by the terms of article 3 of the Code Napoleon, the laws of police and safety bind all those who inhabit French territory, and that consequently foreigners, even transeuntes, find themselves subject to those laws; considering that merchant vessels entering the port of a nation other than that to which they belong cannot be withdrawn from the territorial jurisdiction, in any case in which the interest of the state of which that port forms part finds itself concerned, without danger to the good order and to the dignity of the government; considering that every state is interested in the repression of crimes and offenses that may be committed in the ports of its territory, not only by the men of of the ship's company of a foreign merchant vessel towards men not forming part of that company, but even by men of the ship's company among themselves, whenever the act is of a nature to compromise the tranquillity of the port, or the intervention of the local authority is invoked, or the act constitutes a crime by common law, [droit commun, the law common to all civilized nations,] the gravity of which does not permit any nation to leave it unpunished, without impugning its rights of jurisdictional and territorial sovereignty, because that crime is in itself the most manifest as well as the most flagrant violation of the laws which it is the duty of every nation to cause to be respected in all parts of its territory.' 1 Ortolan, Diplomatie de la Mer ( Sirey, (N. S.) .

ALLEN and another
v.
ST. LOUIS NAT. BANK.
January 10, 1887.
1
When a jury is waived in writing, and the case tried by the court, the court's finding of facts, whether general or special, has the same effect as the verdict of a jury; and, although a bill of exceptions is the only way of presenting rulings made in the progress of the trial, the question whether the facts set forth in a special finding of the court, which is equivalent to special verdict, are suff cient in law to support the judgment, may be reviewed on writ of error without any bill of exceptions. Act March Rev. St. §§ 649, 700;) French v. Edwards, Ex parte French, The question whether the facts found by the court in the case at bar are sufficient to support the judgment below includes the several questions of law affecting the merits of the case. That judgment is for more than $ which is sufficient to give this court jurisdiction in error. Act February ) It is therefore unnecessary to consider whether those questions are duly stated in the certificate of division of opinion, within the rule affirmed in Williamsport Nat. Bank v. Knapp, Sup. Ct. Rep. 
1
2
The leading facts of the case, as found by the circuit court, are as follows:
2
3
The original action was on a promissory note made by the defendants, payable to the order of J. H. Dowell & Co., and by them indorsed to the plaintiff bank. J. H. Dowell & Co. were a partnership of cotton factors at St. Louis, in which Dowell was the acting and managing partner. Dowell was also a partner with the defendants, under the name of Allen & Dowell, in the working of a cotton plantation in Arkansas.
3
4
The note in suit was made and delivered by the defendants to the payees, their factors, to enable them to raise funds to furnish supplies for working that plantation, and under an agreement between the parties that the note should be taken up and paid by the factors out of the proceeds of the cotton crop of the plantation for the coming season when received and sold by them. That crop was consigned to the factors under that agreement, and its proceeds were more than sufficient to pay this note and all other charges of the factors. It is not doubted that upon these facts the makers would have a complete defense to the note in the hands of the payees. But, before the maturity of the note, the payees had it discounted by, and indorsed and delivered it to, the plaintiff bank, with which they kept their deposit account, and of which they from time to time borrowed large sums of money. As soon as they received the bills of lading of cotton consigned to them as factors by the defendants or by other persons, they delivered those bills to the bank, which thereupon gave them a credit, in their deposit account, of $40 for each bale, and took their note for the amount, payable on demand, with interest. On the arrival of the cotton, it was delivered to warehousemen, who gave receipts undertaking to deliver it to bearer, and these receipts were delivered to the bank in exchange for the bills of lading, which were surrendered and canceled. There was no evidence that either the bills of lading or the warehouse receipts were indorsed in writing. The bank knew that the payees of the note in suit were factors, and that they held the cotton as such. It did not know, and made no inquiry, as to the ownership of any of the cotton, or the dealings of the factors with the owners, or the state of accounts between them.
4
5
The cotton was sold in the following manner: The factors negotiated sales by means of samples, and fixed the price and other therms of sale. The bank received the whole price from the purchasers, and delivered to them the warehouse receipts, and credited the factors with the amount received, but at the same time, and as part of the same transaction, required them to draw, and they did draw and deliver to the bank, their checks for the amount of their demand notes held by the bank. After all the cotton had been sold, there was a large balance of account due from the factors to the bank.
5
6
The substance of the transaction between the factors and the bank in regard to the cotton was that the factors delivered the bills of lading and warehouse receipts to the bank to secure the repayment of money lent them by the bank, and thereby made a pledge of the cotton to secure their own debt, (Insurance Co. v. Kiger, ) and that the bank sold, on terms negotiated by the factors, the cotton so pledged to it, and received the price from the purchasers. The notes and checks which passed between the factors and the bank were but forms to carry out the main purpose of the transaction between them, and did not change its nature or effect.
6
7
By the common law, a factor or agent for sale has no power to pledge, whether the owner has intrusted him with the possession of the goods themselves, or with the symbol of them, as by consigning them to him by a bill of lading in which he is consignee or indorsee. 2 Kent, Comm. Kinder v. Shaw, Warner v. Martin, Phillips v. Huth, Cole v. Northwestern Bank, L. R. And such was the law of Missouri before the passage of any statute upon the subject. Benny v. Rhodes, Benny v. Pegram. 
7
8
The essential difference between a power to sell and a power to pledge is well brought out in a recent case in the house of lords by Lord Chancellor SELBORNE, who said: 'It is manifest that, when a man is dealing with other people's goods, the difference between an authority to sell and an authority to mortgage or pledge is one which may go to the root of all the motives and purposes of the transaction. The object of a person who has goods to sell is to turn them into money; but, when those goods are deposited by way of security for money borrowed, it is a transaction of a totally different character. If the owner of the goods does not get the money, his object and purpose are simply defeated; and if, on the other hand, he does get the money, a different object and different purpose are substituted for the first, namely, that of borrowing money and contracting the relation of debtor with a creditor, while retaining a redeemable title to the goods, instead of exchanging the title to the goods for a title, unaccompanied by any indebtedness, to their full equivalent in money.' City Bank v. Barrow. 
8
9
The weight and bearing of the cases cited at the bar upon the construction of the statutes of Missouri annexed to the finding of facts, cannot be properly appreciated without keeping in mind the provisions of the various statutes under which those cases arose.
9
10
The English factors' act of 6 Geo. IV. c. 94, passed in 1825, enacted in section 2 that any person intrusted with and in possession of any bill of lading, warehouse receipt, or other like document, should be deemed and taken to be the true owner of the goods described therein, so far as to give validity to any contract made by him with other persons for the sale or disposition of the goods, or for the deposit or pledge thereof as a security for advances made by them 'upon the faith of such several documents, or either of them;' provided such persons had no notice, by such documents or otherwise, that the person intrusted as aforesaid was not the actual and bona fide owner of the goods.
10
11
The New York factors' act of based upon the act of 6 Geo. IV., provided in section 3 that every factor or other agent intrusted with the possession of any bill of lading, custom-house permit, or warehouse-keeper's receipt for the delivery of merchandise, and every such factor or agent not having the documentary evidence of title, but intrusted with the possession of any merchandise for the purpose of sale, or as a security for any advances to be made or obtained thereon, should be deemed to be the true owner thereof, so far as to give validity to any contract made by him with any other person for the sale or disposition of the merchandise for any advances made by such other person 'upon the faith thereof.' It will be observed that this section did not in terms repeat the proviso of the corresponding section of the English act.
11
12
But, before the enactment in Missouri of any o the statutes cited in argument, the construction of this section of the New York statute had been settled by decisions of the highest courts of that state, and of this court, to be that the words 'on the faith thereof' were not to be referred to 'merchandise,' or to its symbols, but to the words 'shall be deemed to be the true owner thereof.' In the leading case, Mr. Justice BRONSON, speaking for Chief Justice NELSON, Mr. Justice BEARDSLEY, and himself, said: 'The obvious meaning is that the factor or other agent who has been intrusted with certain documentary evidence of title, or with the possession and ostensible ownership of the property, shall he deemed the true owner so far as may be necessary to protect those who have dealt with him 'upon the faith thereof;' that is, upon the faith, induced by the usual indicia of title, that he was the true owner of the property. The second section of the British statute, which answers very nearly to the third section of our own, contains a proviso which expressly saves the rights of the true owner where the pledgee had notice that he was dealing with an agent; and our statute, though framed in a different manner, was evidently designed to produce the same result. It is impossible to suppose that the legislature intended to enable the factor to commit a fraud upon his principal by pledging or obtaining advances upon the goods for his own purposes, when the pledgee or person making the advances knew that he was not dealing with the true owner.' Stevens v. Wilson, ( S. C. in court of errors, ( Warner v. Martin, ( Covell v. Hill, ( Cartwright v. Wilmerding, ( Dows v. Greene, Id. See, also, Howland v. Woodruff, ( First Nat. Bank v. Shaw, (.
12
13
If the legislature of Missouri had adopted the words of that provision of the New York factors' act, the meaning of which had been thus settled on full consideration by the highest courts of that state and by this court, there would be the strongest ground for holding, in accordance with a familiar canon of construction, that it had enacted those words with that meaning. Cathcart v. Robinson, McDonald v. Hovey, Sup. Ct. Rep. Com. v. Hartnett, Scruggs v. Blair, Wiesner v. Zaun. 
13
14
But the statute of Missouri of March 4, 1869, differs widely, in language and in purpose, from the New York factors' act of and was apparently derived, through sections 6 and 9 of the Missouri statute of March 10, 1868, from the statute of New York of entitled 'An act to prevent the issue of false receipts, and to prevent fraudulent transfers of property, by warehousemen, wharfingers, and others,' as amended by the statute of that state of extending its provisions to bills of lading. None of these provisions of the Missouri statutes are limited or even addressed to factors or other agents authorized to sell the goods of their principals, and intrusted for that purpose with the possession either of the goods, or of warehouse receipts, bills of lading, or other similar documents in which such agents are named as consignees. But their leading object is to regulate the manner and effect of transferring warehouse receipts and bills of lading by indorsement.
14
15
By section 6 of the statute of Missouri of (following almost word for word the statutes of New York of ) it was enacted that warehouse receipts or bills of lading 'may be transferred by indorsement thereon; and any person to whom the same may be transferred shall be deemed and taken to be the owner of the goods, wares, merchandise, grain, flour, or other produce or commodity therein specified, so far as to give validity to any pledge, lien, or transfer made or created by such person or persons,'that is, by the indorsee before mentioned; and by section 9 warehouse receipts and bills of lading were made 'negotiable by indorsement in blank, or by special indorsement, in the same manner and to the same extent as bills of exchange and promissory notes.' Laws Mo. pp. 
15
16
By section 3 of the statute of those sections of the statute of are repealed. But section 1 of the later statute substantially re-enacts section 9 of the earlier one, substituting for the words 'by indorsement in blank, or by special indorsement,' the words 'by written indorsement thereon and delivery,' and omitting the words 'and to the same extent;' and section 2 re-enacts section 6, with the substitution, for the words 'by indorsement thereon,' of the words 'by indorsement in writing thereon, and the delivery thereof so indorsed,' and, for the words 'by such person or persons,' of the words 'thereby, as on the faith thereof.' Laws Mo. p. 91.
16
17
The principal provisions of the statute of then, as to all warehouse receipts and bills of lading, (except those which have the words 'not negotiable' plainly written or stamped upon their face,) areFirst, that they are 'made negotiable by written indorsement thereon and delivery, in the same manner as bills of exchange and promissory notes;' and, second, that any person 'to whom the same may be transferred shall be deemed and held to be the owner of the goods,' 'so far as to give validity to any pledge, lien, or transfer, given, made, or created thereby, as on the faith thereof.'
17
18
The first provision, while it doubtless gives the indorsee the right to sue thereon in his own name, does not, for the reasons fully stated by Mr. Justice STRONG in delivering the judgment of this court in Shaw v. Railroad Co., attach to such an indorsement of the symbol of property the same effect which the common law gives to the indorsement of a bill of exchange or promissory note for the payment of a sum of money; nor confer upon persons making, upon a bill of lading indorsed in blank by the owner, an advance of money to a subsequent indorser whom they have reason to believe not to be the owner, the right to hold the goods against the true owner.
18
19
The second provision does not appear to have been brought to the notice of this court in that case, and presents more difficulty. It differs from the provision of the factors' act of New York, construed by the courts of that state and by this court in the cases before cited, in several important particulars: (1) Any person 'to whom the same may be transferred [instead of any person by whom it is transferred] shall be deemed and held to be the owner.' (2) The ensuing qualification is, 'so far as to give validity to any pledge, lien, or transfer, given, made, or created thereby,' which last word cannot possibly be referred to anything but the transfer aforesaid. (3) The words 'as on the faith thereof' follow directly afterwards, without any intermediate mention of advances made by the transferee. In short, the New York factors' act declares that any agent intrusted with the possession of goods, or of the symbol thereof, shall be deemed to be the true owner, so far as to give validity to a pledge made by him to another person for advances made by the latter 'on the faith thereof;' but the Missouri statute only declares that an indorsee of the symbol of property shall be deemed to be the owner so far as to give validity to any pledge made to him by such indorsement 'as on the faith thereof.' The difficulty arises from the introduction of the words 'on the faith thereof,' borrowed from the factors' acts, into a statute relating to the negotiability of warehouse receipts and bills of lading, without sufficient regard to the difference in the terms and the objects of the two classes of statutes.
19
20
It may well be that, upon a view of the whole provis on, it protects only bona fide indorsees, (Whitlock v. Hay, Steiger v. Third Nat. Bank, McCrary, Fed. Rep. But it is by no means clear that the mere fact that the indorsee of the bill of lading or warehouse receipt knows that the indorser is a factor, and holds the goods as such, is sufficient proof of bad faith. Under the English factors' act of 5 & 6 Vict. c. 39, extending the provisions of the act of 6 Geo. IV., and protecting those advances only which are 'made bona fide, and without notice that the agent making' the pledge 'has not authority to make the same, or is acting mala fide in respect thereof against the owner' of the goods, it has been held by the highest authorities that knowledge that the agent making the pledge is a factor, without further notice that he is acting mala fide and beyond his authority, does not deprive the pledgee of the protection of the statute. Navulshaw v. Brownrigg, S. C. De Gex, M. & G. Vickers v. Hertz, L. R. H. L. Sc. Kaltenbach v. Lewis, Yet it may be doubted whether receiving, from persons known to be factors, and to hold property as such, a pledge of the symbols of the property to secure the payment of the general balance of their bank-account with the pledgee, is consistent with good faith.
20
21
We have considered the question of the effect of the words 'on the faith thereof,' as used in Missouri and elsewhere, at some length, because of the large space devoted to it in the arguments of counsel, and in order to put the whole matter in a clearer light. But it is not necessary to express a decisive opinion upon the meaning of those words as they stand in the Missouri statute of because, upon a narrower ground, it is quite clear that that statute affords no protection to the plaintiff. That statute applies only to transfers of warehouse receipts and bills of lading by 'indorsement in writing thereon, and the delivery thereof so indorsed.' The finding of facts contains this statement: 'It is not shown whether or not the bills of lading or the warehouse receipts, or any of them, were indorsed in writing by J. H. Dowell & Co., or by any one, when transferred to the bank; there being no evidence on this specific matter.' The want of any evidence upon this point is perhaps to be explained by the facts, also found and stated, that, upon the delivery of the warehouse receipts to the bank, the bills of lading were surrendered and canceled, and that the warehouse receipts ran to bearer, and were therefore probably not indorsed. But, whatever be the explanation, the fact remains that it was not proved, and cannot be presumed, that either the bills of lading or the warehouse receipts were indorsed in writing as required by the statute; and no better title passes by a transfer of the symbols without such indorsement than by a delivery of the goods which they represent. Rice v. Cutler, Hirschorn v. Canney, Erie & Pacific Dispatch v. St. Louis Cotton Comp. Co., Fourth Nat. Bank v. St. Louis Cotton Comp. Co.. 
21
22
The decision in Price v. Wisconsin, etc., Ins. Co., on which the plaintiff much relied, was based both upon a warehouse receipt act differing from that of Missouri, in allowing the documents to be transferred 'by delivery, with or without indorsement,' and in not containing the words 'as on the faith thereof;' and also upon other grounds inconsistent with the judgments of this court in Warner v. Martin and Shaw v. Railroad Co., before cited.
22
23
The statute of Missouri of March 28, 1874, affixing a heavy penalty to the negotiation or pledge of bills of lading or warehouse receipts by an agent or consignee, without the written authority of the owner or consignor, does not change the law as to the validity of the transfer as betwee individuals. A transfer by an agent that before was valid, as between his principal and his transferee, is not invalidated by the statute. Gardner v. Gager, And with even stronger reason a transfer that was wholly invalid before, is not rendered valid by being made a criminal offense. The proviso that any consignee or agent, lawfully possessed of a bill of lading or warehouse receipt, may pledge it to the extent of raising sufficient means to pay charges for storage or shipment, or for advances drawn for by the owner or consignor, has no application to this case; because this pledge was not made for either of those purposes, but to secure the factors' own debt to the pledgee.
23
24
Factors having no power, by the law of Missouri, to make a pledge of the goods of their principals by a transfer, without indorsement in writing, of the bills of lading or warehouse receipts, the finding of the circuit court that the transactions between the factors and the plaintiff 'were all according to the general usage of trade between banks and cotton factors at St. Louis,' cannot aid the plaintiff; because the usage attempted to be set up was not shown to have been known to the defendants, or to other owners of cotton; and because it was contrary to law, in that it undertook to alter the nature of the contract between the factors and their principals, which authorizes them to sell, but not to pledge, and in that it would sustain a pledge by a factor of the goods of several principals to secure the payment of his own general balance of account to a third person. Barnard v. Kellogg, Irwin v. Williar, Sup. Ct. Rep. Newbold v. Wright, Lehman v. Marshall, Leuckhart v. Cooper, 3 Bing. N. C. Scott, 521, and Robinson v. Mollett, L. R. 
24
25
Nor is the further fact found, that Dowell, the active member of the firm of J. H. Dowell & Co., the factors, was also a partner with the defendants in the working of the plantation, at all material, because he had not been held out by the defendants as the owner of the property, or as authorized by them to dispose of it otherwise than as a factor, and was not understood by the plaintiff to be acting in any other capacity. Rogers v. Batchelor, Locke v. Lewis. 
25
26
Although the general relation of a bank to its depositor is that of debtor and creditor, yet when, as in this case, a factor, holding property in trust for his principal, transfers it to a bank which has notice of the capacity in which he holds it, the principal may assert his right in the property against the bank, either by independent suit, or by way of defense to an action by the bank against him. The defendants in this case were therefore entitled to have the proceeds of their property, so received by the plaintiff, applied to the payment of the note in suit. National Bank v. Insurance Co., Baker v. New York, etc., Bank, N. E. Rep. St. Louis Nat. Bank v. Ross, As those proceeds are found to have been more than sufficient to pay and satisfy this note and all other charges of the factors against the defendants, the plaintiff cannot maintain this action.
26
27
All the facts of the case being ascertained by the special finding of the court below, as they would be by the special verdict of a jury, there is no reason for awarding a new trial, but there must be a general judgment for the defendants. Fort Scott v. Hickman, Sup. Ct. Rep. 56.

28
Judgment reversed, and case remanded to the circuit court, with directions to enter judgment for the original defendants.

v.
SYMONDS.
January 10, 1887.
1
The question in this case is whether certain services of the appellee, a lieutenant in the navy of more than five years' standing, were performed 'at sea,' within the meaning of section of the Revised Statutes. That section provides as follows: 'The commissioned officers and warrant officers on the active list of the navy of the United States, and the petty officers, seamen, ordinary seamen, firemen, coal-heavers, and employes in the navy, shall be entitled to receive annual pay at the rates herein stated, after their respective designations: * * * Lieutenants, during the first five years after date of commission, when at sea, $ on shore duty, $ on leave or waiting orders, $ after five years from such date, when at sea, $ on shore duty, $ on leave or waiting orders, $'
1
2
By an order of the secretary of the navy, June 30, 1881, the officer commanding the United States training ship New Hampshire, then at Norfolk, Virginia, was authorized to enlist officers' stewards, cooks, and servants, such as were allowed for a vessel with her complement of officers; the order declaring that her officers 'will be considered as attached to a vessel commissioned for sea service, the same as other apprentice training vessels.' On the first day of April, 1882, Symonds, in obedience to orders, assumed the post of executive officer of the New Hampshire, and thereafter discharged the duties of that position, which were similar to those performed by executive officers of cruising ships. He also discharged other duties of a character more exacting and arduous than those on board of any other class of naval vessels. There was no change in the nature of his services after he reported for duty as executive officer of the New Hampshire. He was required to have his quarters on board, to wear his uniform, to mess on the vessel, and was not permitted, by the rules of the service, to live with his family. When he reported on board that ship she was stationed at Narragansett bay, and, during most of his service thereon, was the flag-ship of the training squadron.
2
3
On the seventh day of July, 1882, the then secretary of the navy issued an order to the effect that, 'on and after the first day of August next, the New Hampshire, the Minnesota, the Intrepid, and the Alarm will not be considered in commission for sea service.' There was, however, no change in the status of the ship on or after August, 1882, her equipment and complement of officers being those of a cruising ship. From April 1, 1882, to July 31, 1882, appellee was allowed sea pay, and commutation of rations at 30 cents per day; but from the latter date he as allowed only shore pay of an officer of his grade, without rations or commutation therefor. This suit was brought by appellee to recover the difference between pay for sea and shore duty, as regulated by section of the Revised Statutes.
3
Section 1571 of the Revised Statuteswhich is a reproduction of the third section of an act of June 1, 1860, increasing and regulating the pay of the navy, (12 St. 27)provides that 'no service shall be regarded as sea service except such as shall be performed at sea, under orders of a department, and in vessels employed by authority of law.' It is not disputed that the services of Symonds were performed under the orders of the secretary of the navy, and in a vessel employed by authority of law. If they were performed 'at sea,' his compensation therefor is absolutely fixed by section Does the statute confer upon the secretary of the navy, acting alone or by direction of the president, the power to declare a particular service to be shore service, if, in fact, it was performed by the officer 'when at sea,' under the orders of the department, and on a vessel employed by authority of law? By the navy regulations of it was declared that 'duty on board a sea-going vessel of the navy in commission, on board a practice ship at sea, or on board a coast-survey vessel actually employed at sea, will be regarded by the department as sea service.' Page 85. Assuming that the first clause of that regulation contemplates services at sea under the orders of the department, in a vessel employed with authority of law, it is clear that all the different kinds of services described therein are services performed at sea, in the meaning of section But they are to be deemed such, not because the secretary of the navy has announced that the department will so regard them, but because they are, in fact, services performed at sea, and not on shore. If the regulations of had not recognized services 'on board a practice ship at sea' as sea services, the argument in behalf of the government would imply that they could not be regarded by the courts, or by the proper accounting officers, as sea services; in other words, that the secretary of the navy could fix, by order, and conclusively, what was and what was not sea service. But congress certainly did not intend to confer authority upon the secretary of the navy to diminish an officer's compensation, as established by law, by declaring that to be shore service which was, in fact, sea service, or to increase his compensation by declaring that to be sea service which was, in fact, shore service. The authority of the secretary to issue orders, regulations, and instructions, with the approval of the president, in reference to matters connected with the naval establishment, is subject to the condition, necessarily implied, that they must be consistent with the statutes which have been enacted by congress in reference to the navy. He may, with the approval of the president, establish regulations in execution of, or supplement-ary to, but not in conflict with, the statutes defining his powers, or conferring rights upon others. The contrary has never been held by this court.
4
5
What we now say is entirely consistent with Gratiot which the government relies. Referring, in the first case, to certain army regulations, and in the other to certain navy regulations, which had been approved by congress, the court observed that they had the force of law. See, also, Smith v. Whitney, Sup. Ct. Rep. In neither case, however, was it held that such regulations, when in conflict with the acts of congress, could be upheld. If the services of Symonds were, in the meaning of the statute, performed 'at sea,' his right to the compensation established by law for sea service is as absolute as is the right of any other officer to his salary as established by law. The same observations may be made in reference o the order of the secretary of the navy of July 7, 1882, whichwithout modifying the previous order that Symonds should perform the duties of executive officer of the New Hampshiredeclared that that ship would not be considered as in commission for sea service after August 1, 1882. It does not appear that the secretary had any purpose, by his order, to affect the pay of the officers of the ship as fixed by the statute. Other reasons doubtless suggested the propriety or necessity of its being issued. But his order is relied upon here as depriving Symonds of the right to sea pay after the date last named. For the reasons stated, that order could not convert the services of Symonds from sea services into shore services, if they were, in fact, performed when 'at sea.'
5
6
We concur in the conclusion reached by the court of claims, namely, that the sea pay given in section may be earned by services performed under the orders of the navy department in a vessel employed, with authority of law, in active service in bays, inlets, roadsteads, or other arms of the sea, under the general restrictions, regulations, and requirements that are incident or peculiar to service on the high sea. It is of no consequence, in this case, that the New Hampshire was not, during the period in question, in such condition that she could be safely taken out to sea beyond the main-land. She was a training ship, anchored in Narragansett bay during the whole time covered by the claim of appellee, and was subject to such regulations as would have been enforced had she been put in order and used for purposes of cruising, or as a practice ship at sea. Within the meaning of the law, Symonds, when performing his duties as executive officer of the New Hampshire, was 'at sea.' Judgment affirmed.

BISHOP.
January 10, 1887.
1
This case does not differ in principle from that of U. S. v. Symonds, ante, (just decided.) Bishop is now, and has been for more than four years, a lieutenant commander in the navy. By direction of the secretary of the navy, he assumed the duties of executive officer of the training ship Minnesota, on the eighteenth of April, 1884. During the period of such service that vessel was stationed in New York harbor, cruising and moving about under her own power. Her machinery and equipment were kept in order, and she was perfectly sea worthy, capable, upon short notice, of being used in a protracted cruise. The duties of Bishop, while such executive officer, were more arduous and confining than those of officers of similar grade upon vessels in foreign waters.

For the reasons given in U. S. v. Symonds, ante, we are of opinion that the services of appellee were, within the meaning of section of the Revised Statutes, performed 'at sea,' and consequently it was rightly adjudged in the court below that he was entitled to sea pay, as established for officers of his grade, during the period of his service on the Minnesota. Judgment affirmed.

v.
PHILBRICK.
January 10, 1887.
1
The appellee, Philbrick, having served as a carpenter in the navy from July 8, 1861, to March 14, 1866, and again continuously after November 12, 1869, filed with the fourth auditor of the treasury his claim for the benefits of the acts of congress of March 3, providing, among other things, that 'all officers of the navy shall be credited with the actual time they may have served as officers or enlisted men in the regular or volunteer army or navy, or both, and shall receive all the benefits of such actual service in all respects in the same manner as if all said service had been continuous, and in the regular navy, in the lowest grade having graduated pay held by such officer since last entering the service.' The claim, having been passed by the fourth auditor, was forwarded to the second comptroller of the treasury, who is the reviewing officer charged with the examination of all accounts of this class. The latter officer, while recognizing that the appellee had a valid claim under the act of deducted from the amount which the fourth auditor had ascertained to be due the sum of $ That amount was made up of two items, $.

In respect to the item of $ which is the only one disputed on this appeal, the second comptroller held that that sum had, by mistake of law, been improperly allowed and paid to appellee for commutation of quarters, furniture, lights, and fuel from November 12, 1869, to July 1, 1870, although such payment was in conformity with a general order issued by the secretary of the navy on the twelfth of May, 1866, in reference to allowances to officers in that branch of the public service. It is, however, insisted, on behalf of the United States, that that order was unauthorized by law and void, and consequently that the amount allowed under it to appellee was properly chargeable against his claim for pay under the act of .
2
3
So far as we are aware, the first act of congress providing for special allowances or compensation to officers, seamen, and marines beyond their regular pay, was that of April 18, 1814. The second section of that act authorized the president 'to make an addition, not exceeding twenty-five per cent., to the pay of the officers, midshipmen, seamen, and marines engaged in any service, the hardships or disadvantages of which shall, in his judgment, render such addition necessary.' That section was, however, ever, repealed by the act of February The reasons whcih led to the withdrawal of this power from the president are not disclosed in any public document to which our attention has been called. The practice which prevailed in the navy department for many years after the passage of the act of in reference to special allowances to or for the benefit of naval officers beyond their regular payof which practice congress was fully informedtends to show that the repeal of the act of was not intended as a prohibition of allowances of every kind. In the rules, regulations, and instructions prepared by the board of navy commissioners, with the consent of the secretary of the navy, and published in 1818, a copy of which was transmitted to congress by President Monroe on the twentieth of April of that year, (American State Papers, class 6, 'Naval Affairs,' p. ) will be found provisions for certain allowances, graduated according to the character of the vessel, or the rank of the officer in charge. In the rules of the navy department regulating the civil administration of the navy department, prepared under the supervision of Secretary Woodbury, and by him published in 1832 in what is known as the 'Red Book,' are provisions in reference to allowances for cabin furniture, chamber money, furniture of officers' houses at yards fuel, lights, servants, etc. Chapter 10. Besides, the naval appropriation acts, for many years before and after contained items in gross for all the objects covered by these allowances; but none of them contained directions as to the manner in which the sums appropriated should be apportioned. The absence of such directions was no doubt due to the fact, known to congress, that the amounts annually appropriated were used or apportioned by the navy department as indicated in the rules prescribed by the secretary.
3
4
That these allowances were habitually made, and that congress was aware of this practice, appears from a report to President onroe by the secretary of the navy, transmitted to congress on the fourth of March, 1822. That report was accompanied by a statement showing the number and grade of the officers attached to each navy yard or station, with the amount allowed each for pay, subsistence, emoluments, or extra compensation. The secretary in his report says: 'The allowances to officers attached to the navy yards have, I understand, been made to them since the commencement of these establishments, and vary in some instances according to the expense of living, house rent, etc., in the different places at which they are located. The pay and rations authorized by law to officers are understood to be for their maintenance on board ship, in which they are accommodated with rooms, fuel, candles, etc.; but when placed on shore at naval stations they have not such accommodations. * * * The allowances now made are regulated by a table, making them all equal, or as nearly so as practicable. * * * The allowances have, in most instances, been made by the auditor in the settlement of accounts, without any reference to this department; he considering himself authorized so to do by the usage of the service, from the commencement of the naval establishment, with the approbation and sanction of the secretary of the navy.' 1 American State Papers, class 6, 'Naval Affairs,' The subject was subsequently brought to the attention of congress by the report of the secretary of the navy to the senate, January 1, 1825, (2 American State Papers, 'Naval Affairs,' 40;) by the letter of the secretary to the chairman of the house committee on naval affairs, February ) by the communication of the fourth auditor of the treasury, May 28, 1830, which was transmitted to congress, (3 American State Papers, 'Naval Affairs,' ) the latter being accompanied by a table showing every kind of allowance made under the regulations and orders of the navy department. The same facts are disclosed by the report of Amos Kendall, the fourth auditor of the treasury, February 5, 1835, to the secretary of the navy, and transmitted by the latter to the house of representatives in conformity with a resolution of that body. The latter report embodies a statement, in detail, showing the regular pay, rations, and allowances of all commissioned officers of the navy according to the laws and regulations then in force. Ex. Doc. H. of Rep., Navy Dept., Twenty-third Congress, Second Sess.
4
5
Thus matters stood until the passage of the act of March 3, 1835, regulating (and increasing) the pay of the navy, by which allowances of every description were prohibited. The second section of that act provided that 'no allowance shall hereafter be made to any officer in the naval service of the United States for drawing bills, for receiving or disbursing money, or transacting any business for the government of the United States, nor shall be be allowed servants, or pay for servants, or clothing or rations for them, or pay for the same; nor shall any allowance be made to him for rent of quarters, or to pay rent for furniture, or for lights or fuel or transporting baggage. It is hereby expressly declared that the yearly allowance provided in this act is all the pay, compensation, and allowance that shall be received, under any circumstances whatever, by any such officer or person, except for traveling expenses when under orders, for which ten cents per mile shall be allowed.' .
5
6
This prohibition of allowances continued in force until the act of April 17, 1866, making appropriations for the naval service. The fourth section of that act provided 'that so much of the second section of an act entitled 'An act to regulate the pay of the navy of the United States,' approved March 3, 1835, as prohibits any allowance to any officer in the naval service to rent of quarters, or for furniture, or for lights or fuel, or transporting baggage, and all acts or parts of acts authorizing the appointment of navy agents, be, and t e same are hereby, repealed.' 14 St. 38, c. 45.

After the passage of that act Secretary Welles issued the order which the government now assails as unauthorized by law. It is as follows:

8
'(General Order, No. 75.)

9
'NAVY DEPARTMENT, May 23, 1866.
9
10
'Congress having, in view of the call for increased compensation for officers of the navy, repealed the law which prohibited any allowance to them 'for rent of quarters, or to pay rent for furniture, or for lights and fuel,' etc., the department, in order to prevent a recurrence of the irregularities, abuses, and arbitrary allowances which occasioned the prohibition, deems it proper to establish a fixed rate of compensation in lieu of the extra allowances which were prohibited by the law now repealed. Accordingly, from and after the first day of June proximo, officers who are not provided with quarters on shore stations will be allowed a sum equal to thirty-three and one-third per centum of their pay in lieu of all allowances, except for mileage or traveling expenses under orders; and those provided with such quarters, twenty per centum of their pay in lieu of said allowances.

'The act of March 3, 1835, having increased the pay of midshipmen and mates, the allowances hereby authorized will not be extended to them.
11
12
'GIDEON WELLES, Secretary of the Navy.'
12
13
This order was, no doubt, issued in the belief that the legal effect of the repeal of that part of the act forbidding allowances 'for rent of quarters, or for furniture, or for lights or fuel or transporting baggage,' was to reinvest the department with the authority it had prior to the act of That act, upon its face, recognized the fact that such allowances had theretofore been made, and its object was to forbid them in the future. When the act of simply removed the prhibition contained in the act of the effect was, without formal words for that purpose, to restore the law as it was before the passage of the latter act. Such is the rule where the effect of the repealing statute is not by its own terms, or by some general statute, limited to the abrogation of the act repealed. 1 Bl. Comm. 90; 1 Kent. Comm. Bouvier's Bac. Abr. tit. 'Statute,' D; Com. v. Churchill, Van Denburgh v. Village of Greenbush, 66 N. Y. 4. The general rule was never modified by congress until the passage of the act of February 25, 1871, now section 12 of the Revised Statutes, which declared that, 'whenever an act is repealed which repealed a former act, such former act shall not thereby be revived, unless it shall be expressly so provided.' It is scarcely necessary to say that the act of cannot control the present case, for the order of Secretary Welles, and the settlement under it with Philbrick, both occurred before its passage. And for the same reason, this case is unaffected by the fourth section of the act of July 15, 1870, (now section of the Revised Statutes,) which provides that the pay prescribed therein for officers of the navy shall be their full and entire compensation, and that (with certain exceptions not material to be here noticed) 'no additional allowance shall be made in favor of any of said officers on any account whatever, and all laws or parts of laws authorizing any such allowances shall, on the first of July, 1870, be repealed.' .
13
14
Notwithstanding the order of Secretary Welles was in harmony with the long-established practice of the navy department for many years prior to the passage of the act of it is contended that such a practice never has had support in an act of congress; and that, without legislative sanction, the secretary of the navy was without authority to establish an arbitary rule for the distribution of moneys appropriated in gross for specified objects connected with the naval service, and could, in no event, make allowances beyond the actual cost incurred by the officer in whose behalf they were made. It is a sufficient answer to these pro ositions to say that the power of the secretary to establish rules and regulations for the apportionment of the sums set apart by congress, in gross for such objects as those involved in the allowances here in dispute having been frequently exercised prior to without objection by the legislative branch of the government; and since that act, as well as the one of is an implied recognition of the practice established in the navy department prior to we are not disposed, at this late day, to question the validity of the order of May 23, 1866. That order was in accordance with the construction which the executive department, for many years prior to placed upon the various statutes relating to the naval establishment and defining the powers of the secretary of the navy. A contemporaneous construction by the officers upon whom was imposed the duty of executing those statutes is entitled to great weight; and, since it is not clear that that construction was erroneous, it ought not now to be overturned. See Hahn v. U. S., Sup. Ct. Rep. and Brown v. U. S., Sup. Ct. Rep. and authorities cited in each case.
14
15
As these views lead to an affirmance of the judgment, it is unnecessary to consider whether, after the account of the appellee for commutation of quarters, furniture, lights, and fuel, between November 12, 1869, and June 30, 1870, had been finally stated and closed, and after he had been paid the amount allowed him, the second comptroller had authority to open it upon the ground of error therein arising from mere mistake of law; nor need we determine whether errors in accounts so stated, closed and settled by payment, could be corrected otherwise than by regular judicial proceedings instituted for that purpose by the United States against the appellee. Judgment affirmed.

v.
ROCKWELL.
January 10, 1887.

The appellee, Rockwell, served in the volunteer navy as acting master from July 15, 1862, to December 16, 1862; as lieutenant from December 16, 1862, to April 29, 1865; as lieutenant commander from April 29, 1865, to December 8, 1865, when he was honorably discharged; and as acting master from November 19, 1866, to March 12, 1868; in the regular navy, as master, from March 12, 1868, to December 18, 1868; as lieutenant from December 18, 1868, to February 26, 1878; and as lieutenant commander from February 26, 1878, to March 3, 1883. He was paid for his services in those several positions in accordance with the laws in force at the time they were performed. But he claims, in this action, additional pay under the act of March 3, 1883, making appropriations for the naval service for the year ending June He obtained judgment, and upon this appeal the government questions the construction placed by the court below upon that act.
1
2
The act of August 5, 1882, making appropriations for the naval service for the year ending June 30, 1883, and for other purposes, provides: 'And all officers of the navy shall be credited with the actual time they may have served as officers or enlisted men in the regular or volunteer navy, or both, and shall receive all the benefits of such actual service in all respects in the same manner as if all said service had been continuous, and in the regular navy: provided, that nothing in this clause shall be so construed as to authorize any change in the dates of commission, or in the relative rank of such officers.' .
2
3
Very soon after the passage of that act it became necessary for the second comptroller of the treasury to determine, for his office, its full scope and effect. One James Nash had been appointed a boatswain in the regular navy on the seventh of May, 1867. Prior to that time, from July 30, 1862, to April 16, 1866, he served as master's mate and acting gunner. He claimed, under the act of August 5, 1882, that, in ascertaining his rate of pay as boatswain, he should be credited with his former services as master's mate and acting gunner. As the pay of boatswain, prior to August 5, 1882, was fixed by the Revised Statutes (section at certain rates 'during the first three years after date of appointment,' and at certain other designated rates during the second, third, and fourth 'three years after such date,' the second comptroller was of opinion that the services performed by Nash, in any other capacity than that of boatswain, could not be counted in determining his rate of pay, even had such services been continuous, and in the regular navy. And since that act provided that officers should receive the credit and the benefit of services, 'in all respects in the same manner as if all said services had been continuous and in the regular navy,' that officer held that to credit Nash with the time of his service as master's mate and acting gunner would be inconsistent with those provisions of the statute fixing the salary of officers, and making the rate of pay dependent on the period of service in their particular grades. Senate Ex. Doc. t Sess.
3
4
After this interpretation of the act of congress, in the naval appropriation act of March 3, 1883, modified, in some degree, the principle upon which officers of the navy should be credited with the time they served in the volunteer army or navy. The latter act provides (the additions to the act of being shown by italics) that 'all officers of the navy shall be credited with the actual time they may have served as officers or enlisted men in the regular or volunteer army or navy, or both, and shall receive all the benefits of such actual service, in all respects in the same manner as if all said service had been continuous and in the regular navy in the lowest grade having graduated pay held by such officer since last entering the service: provided, that nothing in this clause shall be so construed as to authorize any change in the dates of commission, or in the relative rank of such officers: provided, further, that nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to give any additional pay to any such officer during the time of his service in the volunteer army or navy.' .
4
5
While congress did not, by the last act, give an officer in the regular navy additional pay 'during the time of his service in the volunteer army or navy,' it did give him the benefit of previous service in either, as if all such service had been continuously rendered in the regular navy 'in the lowest grade having graduated pay held by such officer since last entering the service.' What, within the meaning of the statute, was the lowest grade having graduated pay held by Rockwell after he last entered the service? He re-entered the service as master in the regular navy on March 12, 1868. He was promoted to the position of lieutenant on December 16, 1868. The positions of master and lieutenant did not, at either of those dates, have 'graduated pay' attached to them. Their annual compensation was fixed by statute, and was not, during the period of his service as master, or when he became a lieutenant in the regular navy, subject to be increased by length of previous service in any particular grade. But by the act of July now section 1556 of the Revised Statutes,) the pay for ieutenants and masters in the navy was graduated according to length of service in such positions. Under that act the salary of a lieutenant, during the first five years after date of commission, when at sea, is $ when on shore duty, $ and when on leave or waiting orders, $ Masters, during the first five years from date of commission, are allowed annually, when at sea, $ when on shore duty, $ and when on leave or waiting orders, $ In the case of each of those officers this annual salary, after the expiration of the first five years, is increased by $for the different kinds of service performed.

When the act of July 15, took effect, Rockwell still held the position of lieutenant. But at the passage of the act of March 3, 1883, he was lieutenant commander, the pay of which position was likewise graduated, by the act of according to length of service. It thus appears that when the rule of graduated pay was applied by the act of to lieutenants, masters, and other officers of the navy, Rockwell held the position of lieutenant. That was not the lowest grade held by him after 'last entering the service,' but it was the lowest held by him after the pay of officers of the navy was graduated by the act of according to length of service. In other words, it was the lowest position held by him after that act took effect. It seems to the court clear that the actual time of appellee's previous service must be credited to the grade of lieutenant, that being the lowest grade held by him after the act of took effect, having graduated pay attached to it by that act, and not to the grade of master, which, although the lowest held by him after last entering the service, was not graduated, in respect to pay, until after he had ceased to hold it. Such we understand to be the view taken by the court below. That interpretation of the statute meets our approval, and the judgment is affirmed.

ST. TAMMANY WATER-WORKS CO. and another
v.
NEW ORLEANS WATER-WORKS CO.1
January 10, 1887.
1
The parties to this appeal are corporations of the state of Louisiana. The New Orleans Water-works Company was created by a special act of the general assembly of Louisiana, passed March 31, 1877, and was given the exclusive right, for 50 years from the date of its charter, 'of supplying the city of New Orleans and its inhabitants with water from the Mississippi river, or any other stream or river, by means of pipes and conduits, and for erecting and constructing any necessary works or engines or machines for that purpose.' It was vested with authority to construct canals and trenches for conducting 'the water of the rivers from any place or places it may deem fit, and to raise and construct such dykes, mounds, and reservoirs as may be required for securing and carrying a full supply of pure water to said city and its inhabitants,' and 'to lay and place any number of conduits or pipes or aqueducts * * * through or over any of the streets of the city of New Orleans.' It was required to proceed, immediately after its organization, in the 'erection of new works and pipes sufficient in capacity to furnish a full and adequate supply of water, to be drawn from the Mississippi river or elsewhere, as may be judged most expedient.'
1
2
In New Orleans Water-works Co. v. Rivers, Sup. Ct. Rep. which involved the validity of a municipal ordinance granting to one Rivers the privilege of bringing water from the Mississippi river into his hotel, in the city of New Orleans, by means of mains and pipes laid in its streets, it was adjudged that so much of the company's charter as gave it the exclusive privilege before mentioned was, within the meaning of the constitution of the United States, a contract protected against impairment, in respect of its obligation, by that provision of the state constitution of abolishing the monopoly features in the charters of all then existing corporations other than railroad corporations. Consequently that ordi ance was void as interfering with the contract rights of the company.
2
3
It was also decided that 'the right to dig up and use the streets and alleys of New Orleans for the purpose of placing mains and pipes for supplying the city and its inhabitants with water is a franchise belonging to the state, which she could grant to persons or corporations upon such terms as she deemed best for the public interests;' and since 'the object to be attained was a public one, for which the state could make provision by legislative enactment, the granting the franchise could be accompanied with such exclusive privileges to the grantee, in respect of the subject of the grant, as in the judgment of the legislative department would best promote the public health and the public comfort, or the protection of public and private property.' But it was also decided that, notwithstanding the exclusive privileges granted to the company, 'the power remains with the state, or with the municipal government of New Orleans acting under legislative authority, to make such regulations as will secure to the public the uninterrupted use of the streets, as well as prevent the distribution of water unfit for use, and provide for such a continuous supply, in quantity, as protection to property, public and private, may require;' and that rights and privileges arising from contracts with the state are 'subject to regulations for the protection of the public health, the public morals, and the public safety, in the same sense as are all contracts and all property, whether owned by natural persons or corporations.'
3
4
The St. Tammany Water-works Company was organized in 1882, under the general laws of Louisiana relating to corporations. Its articles of association declare the object of its incorporation to be 'to furnish and supply the inhabitants of the city of New Orleans and other localities contiguous to the line of its works with an ample supply of pure, clear, and wholesome water from such rivers, streams, or other fountain sources as may be found most available for such purpose,' and to that end to lay pipes and conduits, and construct and maintain such system of water-works as may be required for the purposes of its organization.
4
5
This company being about to take active steps to obtain authority for bringing into New Orleans the waters of the Bogue Falaya river, in the parish of St. Tammany, and distributing the same by means of pipes, mains, and conduits placed in the streets of that city parallel with those constructed by the New Orleans Water-works Company, the present suit was brought by the latter corporation for the purpose of obtaining an injunction against all attemps by the appellant, its agents and employes, to infringe upon the exclusive privileges granted to the appellee. The answer admits the material facts alleged in the bill, but insists that the charter of the appellee, so far as it granted the exclusive privileges in question, could be set aside, repealed, or abolished by the state, or by the legislature, or by the municipal government of New Orleans, in the exercise of police functions. The controlling question is as to the effect of the before-mentioned provision of the state constitution upon the exclusive rights granted to the plaintiff by its charter.
5
6
As the exclusive right of the appellee to supply the city of New Orleans and its inhabitants with water was not restricted to water drawn from the Mississippi river, but embraced water from any other stream, it is impossible to distinguish this case in principle from that of New Orleans Water-works Co. v. Rivers. Upon the authority of the latter case, it must be held that the carrying out by appellant of its scheme for a system of water-works in New Orleans would be in violation of the rights of the appellee, and that the state constitution of so far as it assumes to withdraw the exclusive privileges granted to the appellee, is inconsistent with the clause of the national constitution forbidding a sta e from passing any law impairing the obligation of contracts.
6
7
It is, however, contended, in behalf of the St. Tammany Water-works Company, that the water from the Bogue Falaya river is shown by the proof to be pure, uncontaminated by saline or organic matters to any appreciable extent, and to be more suitable for drinking, washing, cooking, manufacturing, and other purposes, than the water drawn from the Mississippi river, and distributed through the city by the New Orleans Water-works Company; and upon these facts is based the suggestion that the people of New Orleans cannot be prevented, by the contract the appellee has with the state, from obtaining, through any lawful agency, such water as is most beneficial to their health, or best adapted for business or public uses. Touching this and similar suggestions by counsel of the appellant, it is sufficient to say that no question arises in the present case as to whether the state or the municipal government of New Orleans may not, if the public health or the public comfort so require, compel the appellee, now having the exclusive right of supplying the city of New Orleans and its inhabitants with water distributed through pipes laid in the streets of that municipality, (or if it refuses, employ other agencies,) to supply water from some river or stream other than the Mississippi. No such action has been had either by the state or by the city, and consequently there was no substantial dispute between the plaintiff and the city. The latter has not given its assent to the use by the St. Tammany Water works Company of the public streets for the distribution of water by means of pipes laid in them, nor has it, so far as the record shows, determined that the public health would be better protected, or the public comfort subserved, by supplying the people with water from the Bogue Falaya river rather than from the Mississippi river. These are matters which neither the appellant nor individual citizens may determine for the constituted authorities. In what mode such questions may be determined, so as to be binding upon the appellee, need not be considered until they actually arise in proper form.
7
8
The legal effect of the decree is only to prevent the St. Tammany Waterworks Company, under any power it now has, from laying pipes, mains, and conduits in and through the streets of New Orleans, for supplying that city and its inhabitants with water. It It is therefore, upon the authority of the former case, affirmed.

120 U.S. 130
KIRBY, EX'r, etc.,
v.
LAKE SHORE & M. S. R. CO. and others.1
January 10, 1887.
1
The case made by the plaintiff is clearly one of which a court of equity may take cognizance. The complicated nature of the accounts between the parties constitutes itself a sufficient ground for going into equity. It would have been difficult, if not impossible, for a jury to unravel the numerous transactions involved in the settlements between the parties, and reach a satisfactory conclusion as to the amount of drawbacks to which Alexander & Co. were entitled on each settlement. 1 Story, Eq. Jur. § Justice could not be done except by employing the methods of investigation peculiar to courts of equity. When to these considerations is added the charge against the defendants of actual concealed fraud, the right of the plaintiff to invoke the jurisdiction of equity cannot well be doubted.
1
2
Did the circuit court err in adjudging that the suit was barred by the statute of limitations? By the Code of Civil Procedure of New York in force prior to September 1, 1877, the period of six years was prescribed as the limitation for '(1) an action upon a contract, obligation, or liability, express or implied, except a judgment or sealed instrument; * * * (6) an action for relief, on the ground of fraud, in cases which heretofore were solely cognizable by the court of chancery,the cause of action in such case not to be deemed to have accrued until the discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts constituting the fraud.' Voorhees' Code, (4th Ed.) p. 86, § 91.
2
3
The Code which went into operation September 1, 1877, prescribed the like limitation for actions upon contracts, obligations, or liabilities, express or implied, other than judgements or sealed instruments; but in place of subdivision 6 of section 91 of the old Code was substituted the following. '(5) An action to procure a judgment, other than for a sum of money, on the ground of fraud, in a case which, on the thirty-first day of December, 1846, was cognizable by the court of chancery. The cause of action is not deemed to have accrued until the discovery, by the plaintiff or the person under whom he claims, of the facts constituting the fraud.' Code N. Y. as amended in 1877, § 382.
3
4
The circuit court, deeming the jurisdiction in equity and at law to be concurrent in cases like this, was of opinion that the question of limitation is controlled by the local statute, and, upon the authority of Carr v. Thompson, adjudged that this action was not, within the meaning of section of the Code, one 'to procure a judgment, other than for a sum of money, on the ground of fraud;' and that, consequently the cause of action accrued upon the commission of the alleged frauds, (which was in 1871,) and not at the date of their discovery, on the sixteenth of April, 1873. As this view is controverted by the appellant, and is the main ground upon which appellees rely for an affirmance of the judgment below, it must be examined.
4
5
It is not clear that the decision in Carr v. Thompson goes as far as the circuit judge supposed. That was an action against an agent to recover moneys obtained from his principals, and converted to his own use, by means of false and fictitious accounts, rendered from time to time, and which he represented to be correct and just. Fraud, although charged, was not regarded by the state court as the basis of the action. It was not deemed a suit to recover damages for the fraud practiced, but one merely to recover damages for the violation of the agent's contract or obligation to account justly and honestly to his principals. The sole question, the state court said, presented by the complaint and answer was whether the agent properly performed his duty. It also was careful to say: 'It is to be observed that the complaint is not framed for the purpose of opening an account stated. It does not allege the existence of such an account as an obstacle to a recovery which requires the aid of equity to remove; nor, indeed, does the answer set up any such defense.' These remarks, in connection with the further declaration that the words 'an action to procure a judgment, other than for a sum of money, on the ground of fraud,' sufficiently describe 'a case in which judgment for an accounting is sought in addition to, and as a means of reaching, a judgment for money,' lead us to doubt whether that court would hold, in a case like the present, that the time for commencing the action begins to run from the commission, not from the discovery, of the fraud.
5
6
Be that as it may, it is an established rule of equity, as administered in the courts of the United States, that, where relief is asked on the ground of actual fraud, especially if such fraud has been concealed, time will not run in favor of the defendant until the discovery of the fraud, or until, with reasonable diligence, it might have been discovered. Meader v. Norton, Prevost v. Gratz, Michoud v. Girod, Veazie v. Williams, Brown v. Buena Vista, Rosenthal v. Walker, Sup. Ct. Rep. ; Ang. Lim.
6
7
In Bailey v. Glover, it was said that 'in suits in equity, where relief is sought on the ground of fraud, the authorities are without conflict in support of the doctrine that, where the ignorance of the fraud has been produced by affirmative acts of the guilty party in concealing the facts from the other, the statute will not bar relief, provided suit is brought within proper time after the discovery of the fraud. We also think that in suits in equity the decided weight of authority is in favor of the proposition that where the party injured by the fraud remains in ignorance of it, without any fauit or want of diligence or care on his part, the bar of the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is discovered, though there be no special circumstances or efforts on the part of the party committing the fraud to conceal it from the knowledge of the other party.' In the same case it was said: 'To hold that by concealing fraud, or by committing a fraud in a manner that concealed itself, until such time as the party committing the fraud could plead the statute of limitations to protect it, is to make the law, which was designed to prevent fraud, the means by which it is made successful and secure.' See, also, Traer v. Clews, Sup. Ct. Rep. 
7
8
These observations were made with reference to an act of congress prescribing a fixed time within which a suit between an assignee in bankruptcy and persons asserting adverse rights in property conveyed to such assignee should be brought. They are peculiarly applicable to a local statute which, if followed, would impair the power of the courts of the United States to enforce the settled principles of equity in suits of which they have, by the constitution and the laws of the United States, full jurisdiction. While the courts of the Union are required by the statutes creating them to accept, as rules of decision in trials at common law, the laws of the several states, except where the constitution, laws, treaties, and statutes of the United States otherwise provide, their jurisdiction in equity cannot be impaired by the local statutes of the different states in which they sit.
8
9
In U. S. v. Howland, Chief Justice MARSHALL, speaking for the court, said that as the courts of the Union have a chancery jurisdiction in every state, and the judiciary act confers the same chancery powers on all, and gives the same rule of decision, its jurisdiction must be the same in all the states. The same view was expressed by Mr. Justice CURTIS in his work on the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, (page 13,) when he observed that 'the equity practice of the courts of the United States is the same everywher in the United States, and they administer the same system of equity rules and equity jurisdiction throughout the whole of the United States without regard to state laws.' So, in Payne v. Hook, it was said: 'We have repeatedly held 'that the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States over controversies between citizens of different states cannot be impaired by the laws of the states which prescribe the modes of redress in their courts, or which regulate the distribution of their judicial power.' If legal remedies are sometimes modified to suit the changes in the laws of the states, and the practice of their courts, it is not so with equitable. The equity jurisdiction of the courts of the United States is the same that the high court of chancery in England possesses, is subject to neither limitation nor restraint by state legislation, and is uniform throughout the different states of the Union.' See, also, Robinson v. Campbell, Boyle v. Zacharie, Livingston v. Story, Stearns v. Page, Russell v. Southard, Neves v. Scott, Barber v. Barber, Green v. Creighton. 
9
10
In view of these authorities, it is clear that the statute of New York upon the subject of limitation does not affect the power and duty of the court belowfollowing the settled rules of equity to adjudge that time did not run in favor of defendants, charged with actual concealed fraud, until after such fraud was, or should with due diligence have been, discovered. Upon any other theory the equity jurisdiction of the courts of the United States could not be exercised according to rules and principles applicable alike in every state. It is undoubtedly true, as announced in adjudged cases, that courts of equity feel themselves bound, in cases of concurrent jurisdiction, by the statutes of limitation that govern courts of law in similar circumstances, and that sometimes they act upon the analogy of the like limitation at law. But these general rules must be taken subject to the qualification that the equity jurisdiction of the courts of the United States cannot be impaired by the laws of the respective states in which they sit. It is an inflexible rule in those courts, when applying the general limitation prescribed in cases like this, to regard the cause of action as having accrued at the time the fraud was or should have been discovered, all thus withhold from the defendant the benefit, in the computation of time, of the period during which he concealed the fraud.
10
11
It results that even if this be not an action 'to procure a judgement, other than for a sum of money, on the ground of fraud,' within the meaning of the New York Code of Proceedure, the limitation of six years, being applied here, does not, as adjudged below, commence from the commission of the alleged frauds.
11
12
Can the suit be maintained if the cause of action is to be deemed to have accrued from the discovery of the fraud? In Burke v. Smith, where the local statute prescribed six years for the commencement of actions for fraud, the court, after observing that equity acts or refuses to act in analogy to the statute, said: 'We think a court of equity will not be moved to set aside a fraudulent transaction at the suit of one who has been quiescent during a period longer than that fixed by the statute of limitations, after he had knowledge of the fraud, or after he was put upon inquiry with the means of knowledge accessible to him.' Without inquiring whether the plaintiff was not guilty of such gross laches, in applying for relief, as deprived him of all right to the aid of equity, and giving him the benefit of the limitation of six years to be computed from the discovery of the fraud, there seems to be even then no escape from the conclusion that the suit was not brought in time. Seven years, lacking only seven days, ela sed after the discovery of the frauds by the plaintiff's testator before suit was brought.
12
13
The plaintiff, however, contends that he had seven years within which to sue. This position is supposed to be justified by the New York statute of September 13, 1883, which declares that 'the time which shall have elapsed between the death of any person and the granting of letters testamentary or of administration on his estate, not exceeding six months, and the period of six months after the granting of such letters, shall not be deemed any part of the time limited by any law for the commencement of actions by executors or administrators.' 2 Rev. St. N. Y. (Banks & Bros.' Ed.) .
13
14
If this statute has any application to a case where the cause of action accrued in the life-time of the testator or intestate, it cannot avail the plaintiff. It does not give the party claiming the benefit of its provisions both of the two periods of six months therein mentioned, but only such time, not exceeding six months, as elapsed after the death of the testator or intestate before the granting of letters, and the additional time of six months after the granting of letters. Here only 16 days intervened between the death and the granting of letters testamentary. In computing the time for suing there must be excluded only these sixteen days and the six months immediately succeeding that period. In other words, applying the statute of to the case in hand, the plaintiff had only six years, six months, and sixteen days, after the discovery, on April 16, 1873, of the alleged frauds, within which to sue; whereas this action was not brought until seven years, lacking only seven days, after the alleged frauds were discovered.
14
15
We do not conceive that the time of granting the ancillary letters testamentary in New York can affect the question. The will having been proved in Illinois, the place of domicile, there was nothing to prevent the immediate issue of letters upon it in New York. By the laws of that state, no further probate was necessary. A certified copy deposited in the office of the surrogate was all that was required. As this was in the executor's power to have done at any time, he can hardly claim that his own voluntary delay should extend the period which equity considers reasonable for the institution of a suit. 2 Rev. St. N. Y. (2d Ed.) marg. paging 67, § 82; Code Civil Proc. § .

119 U.S. 696
HUBBARD
v.
NEW YORK, NEW ENGLAND & WESTERN INVEST. CO.1
January 17, 1887.
1
This is an action at law brought by the plaintiff in error, a citizen of Massachusetts, against the defendant in error, in the supreme judicial court of that state for the county of Suffolk, and removed by the defendant, a corporation and citizen of the state of Illinois, into the circuit court of the United States for that district. The New York, New England & Western Investment Company is a corporation chartered by the state of Illinois under the name of the Edgar County Land & Loan Company, its name having been subsequently changed. It has an authorized capital stock of $ subject to be increased to $ Its powers were conferred by the third section of an act approved March 8, 1867, which reads as follows:
1
2
'Sec. 3. The said corporation shall have power to borrow money, and to receive money in deposit, and pay interest thereon, and to loan money within or without this state, at any rate of interest not exceeding that now or hereafter allowed by law, to private individuals, and to discount loans, and in computation of time thirty days shall be a month, and twelve months a year, and to make such loan payable either within or without this state, and to take such securities therefor, real and personal, or both, as the directors and managers of said corporation shall deem sufficient, and may secure the payment of such loans by deeds of trust, mortgages, or other securities, either within or without this state; may but and sell negotiable paper or other securities; may open and establish a real-estate agency; may purchase and sell real estate, and shall have power to convey the same in any mode prescribed by the by-laws of such corporation; may accept and execute all such trusts, whether fiduciary or otherwise, as shall or may be committed to it by any person or persons, or by order of any court or tribunal or legally constituted authority of the state of Illinois, or of the United States, or elsewhere; may make such special regulations in reference to trust funds, or deposits left for accumulation or safe-keeping, as shall be agreed upon with the depositors or parties interested, for the purpose of accumulating or increasing the same; may issue letters of credit and other commercial obligations, not, however, to circulate as money; and may secure the payment of any loan made to said company in any way the directors may prescribe.'
2
3
The home office of the company was at Chicago but a branch was established in New York city, which became, and was at the time of the transactions in question in this suit, the main office, at which its business was chiefly transacted. The company also directed the establishment of branch offices at Philadelphia and Boston. The relation between the defendant and the plaintiff grew out of a contract entered into between them, having in view the establishment of the office in Boston. A contract in writing was entered into between them on the seventeenth day of December, 1879, the substantial parts of which are as follows:
3
4
The plaintiff Hubbard agreed 'to open and take charge of a branch office of said corporation at Boston, Massachusetts; to devote his best energies and time to the interests of said corporation, as far as may not be inconsistent with a due regard for the interests of such legal clients as he may have from time to time, always considering his duties towards said corporation as of the utmost importance; to use his best endeavors to place in New England, where it may be of greatest advantage to said corporation, twenty-five thousand dollars ($ of the capital stock of said party of the first part, and generally to do and perform (within his 'division,' so called) all acts for the furtherance of the interests of said party of the first part as shall be consistent with honor, honesty, equity, and fair dealing.'
4
5
On its part the defendant agreed 'forthwith to elect said party of the second part one of its directors, with the title of assistant vice-president; to give said party of the second part the direction of said office designated as the 'Eastern Division,' subject, of course, to the by-laws of said corporation now in force or hereafter to be enacted; to furnish said office and its furniture, all the books, signs, circulars, and advertising which said corporation may require; to pay the salary of its book-keeper, and of such other employes as may be deemed necessary and proper, and, generally, to pay the running expenses of said office; to pay to said party of the second part the sum of eighteen hundred dollars ($ per year as 'salary,' together with all expenses of travel incurred by him on its behalf, and a further amount as 'commissions,' to be determined as follows, to-wit: All business originating in said 'Eastern Division,' which shall include the whole of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts, or transacted at said Boston office, shall be 'valued' according to the amount of gross profit coming therefrom to said corporation, or which can be rightfully claimed by it. After deducting from the aggregate of such profts for each year the sum of fifty-four hundred dollars, ($) plus the amount of book-keeper's salary, said party of the second part shall be entitled to one-third of the balance as commissions, as above. Settlement shall be made between said parties as often as once a month, said party of the second part becoming entitled to said 'commissions' pro rata as soon as the same shall have been earned and received, and shall exceed in the aggregate the amount of $ plus salary of book-keeper, as above set forth, and shall be paid 'in kind.' Said party of the first part shall favor, as much as practicable, said Boston office, to the end that parties within its precincts may deal directly with it. All legal services required by said party of the first part, for itself or others, in suits or proceedings in court, or in the drawing of railroad deeds and mortgages, shall be entitled to extra compensation from said party of the first part.' It was also provided that 'this agreement shall go into effect from the after the sale or purchase by said party of the second part at par of ten thousand dollars ($ of the capital stock of said party of the first part, and payment therefor, and shall be in force for one year, at the end of which time there shall be a general accounting together of said parties, and a new agreement may be made and ntered into, if the mutual interests of said parties may so require.'
5
6
This agreement went into effect, according to its terms, by the plaintiff taking and paying for $of its capital stock, at par, on the twenty-fourth of December, 1879. On the fifth of June, 1880, he was elected a director by the stockholders at their annual meeting in Chicago. The plaintiff opened in Boston the branch office contemplated, and performed all the services required of him during the year fixed by his contract; was paid his salary of $ and reimbursed for all outlays, as provided in the contract of December 17, 1879, rendering monthly accounts to the New York office, as required, to which no objection was ever made; and, apart from the transaction here in question, there was no controversy as to his interest in any part of the gross profits arising under the contract.
6
7
It also appeared from the evidencethe whole of which is set out in the bill of exceptionsthat, through a contract with the Kansas City, Burlington & Santa Fe Railway Company, of which W. H. Schofield was then president, the defendant had for sale certain bonds of that company, and, in order to place them before other railroads and investors, it had issued a circular, dated May 15, 1880, offering for sale these bonds, which were to cover not only the extension of that road to Burlington, Kansas, but also that portion of the road already built from Ottawa to Burlington, and on this completed portion of the road of 45 miles there was already outstanding $of first mortgage bonds, which were to be taken up and canceled from the proceeds of the new bonds offered in this circular. One of these circulars was sent from the New York office to the plaintiff at the Boston office. A negotiation was commenced and carried on personally by J. C. Short, president of the defendant company, with the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad Company, in interviews, some of which occurred at the office of the latter company in Boston. At some of these the plaintiff was present; at others, not. At one of these interviews, on June 10, 1880, at which the plaintiff was not present, a preliminary agreement or memorandum between the parties was entered into, signed by the president of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad Company, the president of the Kansas City, Burlington & Santa Fe Railway Company, and Short, as president of the defendant company. This memorandum contemplated the purchase by the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad Company of the railroad of the Kansas City, Burlington & Santa Fe Railway Company, and, as a means of accomplishing that, the purchase of the mortgage bonds of the latter company, with a view to a foreclosure of the mortgage and the reorganization of the company. This memorandum was supplemented by a subsequent agreement entered into on the thirteenth of June, 1880, to which the parties were the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad Company, the New York New England & Western Investment Company, Alden Speare, Charles S. Tuckerman, and Lucien M. Sargent, the three last named to act as trustees to hold the bonds to be used in consummating the purchase. The object of this contract was to provide and declare the modes by which the property of the Kansas City, Burlington & Santa Fe Railway Company should be sold and delivered to the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad Company free from incumbrance, and contemplated the foreclosure and sale of the road for that purpose. The transaction was completed in accordance with the terms of the contract. It resulted in a gross profit to the New York, New England & Western Investment Company, as is alleged by the plaintiff in his declaration, of $ of which the plaintiff claims to be entitled to recover one-third, on the ground that the business originated and was transacted and said contract was made in said Eastern division or Boston office, and that the plaintiff himself procured, or was instrumental in procuring and carrying out, t e same.
7
8
The cause was tried by a jury, when, at the close of the plaintiff's evidence, the defendant asked the court to instruct the jury to render a verdict for the defendant, which was done, and a verdict rendered accordingly, and judgment thereon, to reverse which this writ of error is prosecuted.
8
9
The error assigned is in the ruling of the court in this instruction to the jury. The principal question, in our view of the case, is one of fact. It is whether, within the meaning of the contract between the parties, December 17, 1879, the business in question, out of which these profits arose, originated in the Eastern division, as therein described, or was transacted at the Boston office. Upon a careful review of the entire evidence, giving to the plaintiff the benefit of all inferences which might reasonably have been drawn by the jury, we are of the opinion that the court below did not err in instructing the jury to find a verdict for the defendant. In our opinion, it clearly appears from the evidence, in which there was no conflict, that the business did not originate in the Eastern division, and was not transacted at the Boston office. It would serve no useful purpose to go into any detail of the testimony, which, we think, admits of no different conclusion.

The plaintiff's declaration, in addition to counting on the special contract in writing, contained also common counts for work and labor done and services performed in and about the negotiation of the contract for the sale of the Kansas City, Burlington & Santa Fe Railway, under which a recovery might have been had, in the absence of a special contract, for the reasonable value of services as a broker, if any such had been performed; but in the present case no such recovery could be had, because it clearly appeared that whatever was done by the plaintiff in that behalf was done under the special written contract, and not upon any implied contract for compensation.

The judgment is accordingly affirmed.

DAVIS, J.

15
It is but simple justice to the counsel on both sides to say, at the outset, that the court has derived the greatest assistance from their able and full discussion of the complicated issues involved in this case, both in their briefs and in their oral arguments.
15
16
The items in the claimant's bill of particulars depend, in some measure, upon the force to be given to a contract known as contract No. In the autumn of the claimant offered to put the Canal road between Aqueduct and Chain bridge in order. Apparently his terms were not acceptable, for no notice was taken of them. A year later the board ordered that a contract should be awarded him for this work, and directed that he be notified of its action. An attempt was made to connect this act with the claimant's acts of the previous year; but the findings show no such connection, and, in our opinion, there was none. The secretary of the board at once wrote to the claimant, but, instead of notifying him of the real doings of the board, he notified him that a contract had been awarded him 'at board rates,' which had not been alluded to by the board in their action. The claimant, before commencing work, saw the defendant's officers in relation to the work and the contract, but what took place can only be inferred from subsequent acts of both parties. The claimant did work to the amount of a few thousand dollars in the autumn of for which he was paid in part. In the spring of he resumed work, and continued at it until the autumn, when a final measurement was had of the work done to that time. For all this work he was paid at board rates, with two exceptionsFirst, he was paid for stone masonry at five dollars per cubic yard, while the board rate was $per perch; second, he was paid nothing for haul. So far as we can gather from the findings, his bills were rendered at the rates at which they were paid, and the payments were received without any intimation that the amounts allowed were too small.
16
17
During the progress of the work the claimant had put macadam on the road by direction of one of the board of public works. This was formally recognized as a part of his contract. In November, 1873, and in December, 1873, the contract, (No. ) under which all the work was supposed to have been done, was formally executed. The findings show that both parties intended to embody in this formal instrument, and supposed they had embodied in it, all the agreements under which the one had been doing work, and the other had been paying money. The instrument was antedated for the purpose, as the findings further show, of making it operative during the whole period of the work.
17
18
The claimant, now, however, makes two objections to this instrument.
18
19
In the first place, it was signed, on behalf of the board of public works, by Henry D. Cooke, Alexander R. Shepherd, and James A. Magruder. Cooke was a member of the board in October, 1872, when the contract with the claimant was actually made, but he had ceased to be a member in December, 1873, when the formal evidence of it was actually signed. Shepherd and Magruder were members throughout. The total number of the board was five. The claimant maintains that the instrument, not having been signed by a majority of the board, is invalid. It is unnecessary for us to decide whether he is correct in this contention, for the findings show that the claimant signed that paper for the purpose of showing what his own understanding of the contract was. If, notwithstanding the written instrument, the contract still rested in parol, the court could have no stronger evidence to show what the claimant intended it to be. If, on the other hand, the written contract is valid, the practical result in the issues in this suit is the same.
19
20
In the second place the claimant maintains that he engaged to do work at board rates; that when the written contract varied from board rates, by excluding haul, and paying masonry at only five dollars a cubic yard, it was a variation made without his knowledge, and against the intent of both parties; and that, these provisions of the contract having been inserted by mistake, the court should reform the contract by restoring board rates as the measure of compensation. This theory rests for its support upon (1) the letter of the secretary informing the claimant that a contract had been awarded him at board rates; (2) the testimony of the claimant that he supposed the rates stated in the written instrument were board rates.
20
21
We have already seen that the letter of the secretary was not justified or authorized by the action of the board. The claimant's contention, therefore, rests mainly upon his own unsupported testimony. On the other hand, it is contradicted by his own consistent conduct from October, 1872, when he began work under the original contract, to January, 1876, when he finished under the last extension of the contract. During all this time he rendered accounts and received pay for masonry at fiv dollars, and for grading without claiming haul. We cannot shut our eyes to these practical acts of construction. We think that before he began work he must have known that the secretary had made a mistake. We are also of opinion that when he signed the contract, in December, 1873, he knew what its purport was, and that it expressed the agreement as he understood it
21
22
Having disposed of this general question, we will take up the items of the claim and counter-claim in detail.
22
23
The claimant's bill of particulars consists of 14 items, 13 of which are in the original petition, and one in the amended petition. Four of these were abandoned at the trial, namely: Stone excavation, cubic yards of haul,
23
24
as above, at cents per cubic yard. $ 0
24
25
per cubic yard, (see Exhibits Nos. 0
25
26

27
The item, 'Balance due on Conduit road, $' was amended at the trial so as to make it a claim for a receiving basin, $ We do not find this claim to be sustained. Finding 30.
27
28
There was also a claim made in the original petition for $ for difference between the face value of certificates and the cash price for the work. In view of previous decisions, this claim was not pressed, and it is unsupported by proof. Finding 37.
28
29
There was also a claim set up in the original petition for $ for difference between the amount audited to the claimant and the amount paid to him. We have disposed of this by finding 18, which states, in substance, that it is not sustained by proof.
29
30
We will take up the remaining items in classified chronological order, and consider them, when pertinent to do so, in connection with the counter-claims.
30
31
The following items stand by themselves, and have no relation to the counter-claims:
31
cubic yards of haul, feet over feet,

40
These claims are for work done before December, 1873, and are founded upon the alleged mistake as to rates. For the reasons already given, they cannot be allowed. The claimant received his contract price both for haul and masonry, and has no just claim to any further compensation for either.
40
41
The next of the series of claims grows out of an extension of contract No. so as to cover the construction of an expensive wall on the south side of the Canal road, and the completion of that road as a first-class road. It was made by the commissioners after the abolition of the board of public works, and was a much more extensive contract than the original. Under this extension the claimant now makes the following claims, which are set forth in his original petition:
41
cubic yards coping, which should have been measured as stone masonry,
42
43
at $5 per cubic yard, (see letter of petitioner of June 4,
43
 and answer of engineer thereto of June 9, 1875, marked, respectively, Exhibits Nos.

 and extension of contract before described,) $ 0

The next items in consecutive order relate to what is known as the 'New Cut Road,' a road near to, and connected with, the Canal (or Little Falls) road, on which the claimant was at work in August, 1875. It appears that this new cut road was badly damaged by storms in that month. The three years' experience which the District authorities had had at that time with the claimant as a contractor appears to have inspired confidence, and in the emergency Mr. Hoxie addressed the following letter, on the thirty-first August, to the claimant: 'You are authorized to repair the roads and culverts in the vicinity of the work now being performed by you along the Little Falls road, which have been damaged by the late storms, as extra work under your contract, No. with the late board of public works. You will present this order with your bill for the work, which will be done under the direction of Mr. Cunningham and Mr. Carroll, overseers.' No answer was made to this communication, but, as the claimant at once went on with the work, he must be presumed have accepted the proposal. In December he rendered an itemized bill, amounting, in the aggregate, to over $ and asking for measurement and payment under his contract. This contract called for payment in cash. The defendant had no cash. Under direction of the commissioners, a bill was made out and certified to at rates which produced an aggregate that would make a payment in certificates equivalent to a payment of the bill rendered in cash, and the claimant was so paid in certificates.
62
63
We do not apprehend that there was anything immoral or intrinsically dishonest in this transaction. The parties assumed, what was a manifest fact, that work to be paid for in depreciated securities was nominally worth higher rates than work to be paid for in cash. But the act was clearly illegal. The defendant, having agreed to pay cash, was legally bound to pay cash; but, when it found itself unable to do so, the law forbade it from parting with its securities to a creditor at less than par. It is too clear for argument that what it did was an attempt to do indirectly what the law forbade it to do directly, which a familiar rule of law makes an impossibility. This payment in certificates, to the amount of $ must therefore be taken to be a cash payment to that amount on account of the work done on the New cut road. It is the only payment that has been made on that account. Our labors in this respect are therefore now reduced to ascertaining the amount of the work done by the claimant on that road.
63
64
On the fourteenth December, 1876, Lieut. Hoxie's addressed to the commissioners a letter, in which he said: 'I transmit herewith final measurement of work done on New cut road, by J. J. Shipman, under contract No. of the late board of public works, amounting to $' The measurements inclosed in this letter show the following apparent variations from contract rates: An allowance of $for masonry, and an allowance for haul. The counsel for defendant asks us to trike these items from the measurement. These measurements were made after the present controversy arose, and undoubtedly express Lieut. Hoxie's well-considered judgment as to the claimant's rights. Their may have been good reason for allowing the haul, and the masonry may have been of a different quality from the rubble cement, for which the contract fixes the price at five dollars. We are not disposed to assume the responsibility of changing these items. Among the items included in this measurement were perches of dry wall. The contract fixes no price for such labor and material. Lieut. Hoxie estimates it to be worth $per perch, and allows that rate. The claimant contends that it is worth more than that, and introduced considerable proof to sustain his contention. We have reached the conclusion that the rate allowed by Lieut. Hoxie is below the prices paid for such wall at the time of the construction, and have found that it was worth $per perch, instead of $ as allowed.
64
65
As the result of this, we disallow the counter-claim on account of the work on the New cut road, and allow the claimant as follows:
65
66
Work done as by Hoxie's estimate. $0
66
perches dry wall, $1 per perch additional. 0

The court orders, andjudges, and decrees that the contract between the claimant and the defendants, referred to in claimant's petition as contract No. correctly and truly sets forth the understanding and intention of the parties, and has not by accident, inadvertence, mistake, or clerical error failed to set forth the same, and ought not to be reformed. And the court further orders, adjudges, and decrees that the claimant has extablished the following items of claim against the defendant, set forth in his petition, or the several amendments thereto, to-wit:
69
70
A claim on account of cubic yards of broken
70

stone, for drainage back of retaining-walls, at

And has failed to establish the residue of the counter-claims set forth in its bill of particulars.

76
And the court further orders, adjudges, and decrees that the claimant shall have and recover of the defendant the sum of $ as due and payable on the first of January, 1876, being the difference between the said amount of claim allowed to the claimant and the said amount of counter-claim allowed to the defendant. And the court further orders, adjudges, and decrees that, except as to the said amount of claims so allowed to the claimant, all the claims demanded in the claimant's petition, and the amendments thereto, be disallowed, and the petition, with reference to all the disallowed claims, be dismissed; and, further, that, except as to the said amount of counter-claims so allwoed to the defendant, the defendant's counter-claims be dismissed.

Excess overpaid. ....................... To overpayment by mistake of fact for grading:
Amount paid for excavation. .. $Amount paid for haul. ......... 1

Excess overpaid. $It will be observed that these claims and counter-claims relate to (1) the retaining-wall; (2) the foundation for it; (3) the lining back of it for drainage; (4) the coping it; and (5) the grading of the road itself. We will consider them in that order.
1. The Wall. The claimant makes no demand on this account. The defendant asks judgment for a large sum for alleged overpayment. The facts are briefly these, (finding 29:) The wall was some 3 miles in length, and in some places as much as 10 feet high. In the very outset the claimant varied from the plans and specifications by constructing it wider than they called for. He gave his reasons for these changes to the assistant engineers of the District, and to the commissioners, and they assented to the change. From time to time, during the work, measurements were taken and returned to the chief engineer, and passed upon by him, and payments made in accordance with them; and all these measurements included the variations thus made. The commissioners knew of it, and the reasons for it, and consented to it. The assistant engineers knew of it, and the engineer in chief might have known of it, if he had paid personal attention to it. There was no attempt at concealment or fraud. When the final payment was made, which is now sought to be recovered back, it was done with the knowledge of the commissioners, and by personal direction of one of them, and with the knowledge and consent of Assistant Engineer Oertly, who was acting as chief in the absence of Mr. Hoxie. The ground of the defendant's claim for repayment is that the engineer in chief did not assent to the changes which involved the construction of yards of masonry beyond his plans. We think this claim cannot be maintained. The defendant further maintains that, in any event, there is an overmeasurement of feet in this wall. In support of this contention it refers to a measurement made by McComb, on behalf of the defendant, which is found to be less by that amount than Franklin's measurement, on which the payment was made. McComb's testimony was given January 24, 1882. On the twenty-first October, 1882, the defendant called Franklin as a witness, and made no inquiry of him on this point, although he did inquire as to other mistakes. Under these circumstances, we cannot set aside Franklin's measurement, and find a payment made under it to have been made in mistake of fact.
2. The Foundation for the Wall. The terms of the contract must govern our decision. It required the claimant to 'construct a stone retaining or parapet wall on the south side of the Little Falls road, between the Aqueduct and Chain bridges, or at such points along said road as may be authorized by the commissioners, at $5 per cubic yard; * * * the present retaining-walls to be removed to such depth from the top as may be directed, and the foundation inspected, and approved by the engineer of the District of Columbia before relaying the wall, which is to be done in cement mortar.' A portion of the new wall was constructed in places where there was no old sall. It is admitted that the contract gives the claimant no claim for the labor in getting r ady for the foundations in places where there was a previous wall. The claim is confined to excavation in places where there was no previous wall. The instrument extending the contract makes no other provision for payment except that already quoted. We are of opinion that it requires the claimant to do all the work necessary for the finished masonry at the agreed price of five dollars, unless there is something in the old instrument which gives him further pay for excavation. Turning to that, we find these provisions only: 'Excavations and refilling, forty (40) cents per cubic yard, to be measured in excavation only;' and 'grading, (30) cents for each and every cubic yard of earth, sand, or gravel excavated and hauled.' It is plain that the provision in regard to grading, does not apply to this case. We think it equally clear that the other does not. This is not a case of excavation and refilling, like a sewer trench; and the rate of payment agreed upon for such double work is not applicable to this. There being nothing in the old contract to control the plain language of the extension, we must decide against the claimant in this item.
3. The Lining Back of the Wall for Drainage. The specification called for 'a lining of coarse gravel twelve (12) inches in thickness, carried up in rear of the retaining-wall,' and the plans showed this in detail. There was no gravel along the line of the road, and it was mutually agreed, during the construction of the work, that macadam material should be substituted for the gravel. The contract is silent as to the rate of pay for this work, which has been satisfactorily performed. The defendant maintains that it was intended to be paid for by the price allowed for the masonry in the wall. The claimant contends that he is entitled to compensation (1) for the labor in excavating the place for the reception of the lining at the rate allowed by the old contract for excavations and refilling; (2) for the lining to be measured as masonry. It is plain that this work of graveling in the rear of the wall, as contemplated by the contract, was a work of considerable labor and expense. We cannot think that either party intended it to be paid for in computing the masonry. In our opinion, it is a casus omissus. The parties have accidentally omitted to fix a price for this work. The claimant has done the work; the District has received the benefit of it; and it only remains for the court to examine the findings, and ascertain whether they furnish the means for fixing its value. In finding 26 will be found the final measurement of the work done under this contract, certified to by Mr. Bodfish, assistant engineer, and Mr. Oertly, assistant engineer for the lieutenant engineer. This measurement contains the following item: 'cubic yards of broken-stone filling, at $ if allowed.' The item was not allowed at that time. The court allows it now as the measure of the amount of such filling, and of its value, and in full for the demands in the claimant's petition and amended petition on account of such filling, and of the excavation for it.
4. The Coping on the Wall. The contract called for a 'coping, to consist of selected stones six to ten inches thick, jointed; in length of not less than two feet; and must project over the parapet wall not less than two nor more than four inches on each side; and must be so disposed along the line of the wall that no two in juxtaposition shall vary in thickness, nor in width, more than three-quarters of an inch.' After laying about a thousand feet of this coping, the claimant wrote to the commissioners that it was expensive, arduous, and unsatisfactory work to make such coping, and made a proposition in the following language; 'That I be allowed to use, for the coping, North river or other suitable coping stone, for which I will be allowed an extra compensation of forty (40) cents per foot. This stone will cost me, delivered on the ground, nearly one (1) dollar per foot; but I am willing to be r more than one-half the expense, only asking the District government to assume the proportion I have named. To this proposition Mr. Hoxie, on behalf of the District, made the following reply: 'You are requested to call at this office to execute the necessary papers for an extension to your contract, No. with the late board of public works, to include the finishing of the parapet wall along the Little Falls road with North river coping, at forty cents per lineal foot, payable in 3.65 bonds at par.'
The claimant did not call and execute the proposed extension, but, instead thereof, went on with the proposed change; and the court is now called upon, from this correspondence, and the acts of the parties, to decide what their agreements really were. Assuming the average thickness of the coping called for by the contract to be 8 inches, and its average width to be 30 inches, the contract price for it, viz., five dollars per cubic yard, would amount to cents per running foot. The diminution in the size caused by using North river blue-stone, taking Hoxie's measurements in finding 28, reduced the contract price for it, measured as masonry, to about cents per running foot. As some compensation for this reduction, as well as the increased cost of the proposed change, (estimated by the claimant at nearly one dollar per foot,) the claimant proposed that he should be allowed an extra compensation of 40 cents per foot. He did not indicate whether he meant 40 cents per square foot, or 40 cents per lineal foot. He now says that he intended square feet, and argues that the engineer must have so understood him, because any other construction would be inconsistent with the prices of blue-stone. Lieut. Hoxie's answer may be construed in two way: (1) either as an acceptance of the claimant's proposition, defining the undefined term in it to be a lineal, and not a square, foot; or (2) as a counter-proposal of 40 cents a running foot, as the entire compensation. We think the first construction the one most consistent with the facts in the case, and the one which gives force to the whole correspondence. It is also the only one consistent with the action of Lieut. Hoxie at a subsequent stage, when he sanctioned a measurement of the work which contemplated an allowance to the claimant for the coping as masonry, and an additional payment by the foot. Finding 28.
When the parties came to settle after the work was done, both agreed that the claimant was to be paid for the coping as masonry, (which we have seen to be about cents per running foot,) and at as high a rate as 40 cents extra per lineal foot, or an aggregate of about cents per running foot. The claimant contended that he was entitled to a gross allowance of 40 cents per square foot, which, allowing the coping to be 2 feet wide, would be 40 cents a running foot additional, or about cents per running foot. The parties compromised by fixing upon a rate of cents a running foot. We cannot say that this payment was made in mistake of fact. We think that it was made and received as a settlement of a disputed item. Regarding it in this light, we can neither, on the one hand, set aside the payments already made, to enable the defendant to recover on its counter-claim, nor can we, on the other hand, award to the claimant the contract price for the coping as masonry; since the claim for it, however well founded it may have been originally, entered into the settlement by which both parties accepted a rate of compensation which neither contemplated when the work was done.
5. The Grading of the Road. The claimant demands nothing further for grading this road. The defendant asks to recover back $ which it says was overpaid, by mistake of fact, for excavation, and for haul in grading. In the final measurement of the work by Mr. Oertly, in January, 1876, which is set forth in finding 26, the claimant was allowed for cubic yards of grading, and for a similar amount of haul. The material in hese two items was the same. The defendants first contend that cubic yards of this material was wrongfully allowed, by mistake, as grading and haul; because, they say, it was allowed and paid for as macadam, and constituted a part of the square yards of macadam measured and allowed in the same measurement. The court has, in finding 29, found this to be so. The defendant further contends that cubic yards of the grading and haul allowed in said measurement was, in fact, filling under the gutters, which, by the extension of the contract, was to be done without charge. As to this the court has found that it does not appear that there was any mistake of fact in that measurement. The result is that the court allows the defendant for one payment, by mistake of fact
For cubic yards grading, at For cubic yards haul, at 3

$Less payments in certificates at par. 2

Making a total of................ $ And has failed to establish the residue of the claims set forth in said petition and amendments.
And the court further orders, adjudges, and decrees that the defendant has established the following items of counter-claim against the claimant, to-wit:

yards of grading on the Canal road, at 30 cents
per cubic yard. ................ $Overpayment, by mistake of fact, for cubic
