v.
WISWALL.
October Term, 1874

The writ of error is dismissed upon the authority of Insurance Company v. Comstock.** The order of the Circuit Court remanding the cause to the State court is not a 'final judgment' in the action, but a refusal to hear and decide. The remedy in such a case is by mandamus to compel action, and not by writ of error to review what has been done.***

APPEAL from the Circuit Court for the Northern District of New York; the case being thus:
2
3
On the 5th of April, 1853, Dennis Littlefield, of New York, being at the time the patentee under a patent issued April for 'a coal-burner so constructed as to produce combustion of the inflammable gases of anthracite coals,' and having then on file in the Patent Office an application, dated December for a patent securing to him a stove arranged and operating 'for the purpose of economizing and burning the gases generated during the combustion of anthracite and other coals'—and the applicant stating that it was his purpose to apply it 'to furnaces for heating buildings, to cooking-stoves or ranges, to the furnaces of locomotives, or in any other situation where it is an object to economize waste gases or to consume smoke'—entered, as a party of the first part, into an agreement—evidenced by two separate documents, the first styled in some of the pleadings in the case, 'a grant,' and the second 'a supplementary agreement'—with the firm of Treadwell & Perry (to whom he then owed the sum of $ as a party of the second part, concerning the subjects, &c., embraced in the patent. The 'grant' was thus:
3
4
'Whereas letters-patent have been granted to and are now held by the said party of the first part, for a coal-burner so constructed as to produce combustion of the inflammable gases of anthracite coal, which letters bear date the 15th of April, 1851. And whereas, the said party of the first part has made application to the Patent Office for letters-patent, securing to him a certain improvement in the invention so as aforesaid patented by him, and said application is now pending; therefore, the said party of the first part, in consideration of one dollar to him in hand paid by said parties of the second part, and of the agreements herein contained on the part of said parties of the second part, and of the agreements contained in a certain agreement this day executed between the parties hereto, and bearing even date herewith, hath and by these presents doth assign and transfer to the said parties of the second part, their executors, administrators, and assigns, all the right, title, and interest which the said party of the first part now has, or can or may hereafter have in or to the aforesaid inventions, improvement, and patent, or the patent or patents that may be granted for said inventions, or any improvements therein, and on any extension or extensions thereof within and throughout the territory embraced within the States of New York and Connecticut, for and during the term for which the aforesaid letters-patent were granted, and the terms for which any patent for the aforesaid improvement, and any other improvement or improvements thereof, or extensions for or of either thereof, may be granted. And the said party of the first part doth hereby, for himself, his heirs, executors, and administrators, guaranty to the said parties of the second part the full and uninterrupted enjoyment of the use and right to use, to make, construct, and to vend to others to use, the inventions, improvements, and patents aforesaid, during the terms aforesaid, as against all other persons whomsoever within the territory aforesaid.
4
5
'And the said parties of the second part hereby agree to pay unto the said party of the first part, for the right and interest hereby assigned and conveyed, provided, and as long as said party of the first part shall well and faithfully keep and perform all the agreements herein, and in the aforesaid agreement this day executed, between the parties hereto, the sum of fifty cents on each and every stove or coal-burner embracing said inventions and improvements hereby assigned, which shall be sold by said parties of the second part, after they shall have sold fifteen hundred of said stoves or coal-burners; such payments to be made at the times and in the manner particularly specified in the aforesaid agreement this day executed between the parties hereto.
5
6
'It is expressly understood and agreed between the said parties, that in case said party of the first part shall well and faithfully keep and perform all the agreements herein and in the aforesaid agreement, bearing even date herewith, contained, on his part, and the said parties of the second part, their executors, administrators, and assigns, shall without just cause refuse, or shall neglect to make and sell said coal-burners to such extent as the demand therefor shall reasonably warrant and require, after reasonable notice shall be given to them by said party of the first part, requiring them so to make and sell the same, that this assignment and transfer shall thereafter be void and of no effect, and all the rights and interests herein and hereby conveyed shall thereupon revert to the said party of the first part, his executors, administrators, and assigns.'
6
7
The 'supplementary agreement,' dated like the other, on the 5th of April, 1853, and like the other, with Little-field, the patentee, for a party of the first part, and Treadwell & Perry, the assignees, party of the second part, was thus:
7
8
'Whereas, the said party of the first part hath agreed to sell, assign and transfer unto said parties of the second part, all the right, title, and interest which said party of the first part now has, or can or may hereafter have, in or to certain letters-patent of the United States, granted to him on the 15th of April, 1851, and the invention thereby patented, and to a certain improvement thereon, an application for a patent for which is now pending, and to any and all extensions thereof, within the States of New York and Connecticut, upon certain conditions and stipulations. And whereas said party of the first part is now indebted to the said parties of the second part in about the sum of $ and it is understood and agreed between the parties hereto that the premium of fifty cents upon each stove embracing said invention and improvements of said party of the first part which shall be sold by said parties of the second part, shall be retained by them until they have sold fifteen hundred of said stoves, and applied upon the aforesaid indebtedness of said party of the first part to them. Now, in consideration of the premises, the said parties to this agreement hereby mutually agree to and with each other as follows, to wit:
8
9
'The said party of the first part hereby agrees——
9
10
'1. That in case any suit or proceeding shall be commenced against the said parties of the second part, or any persons holding under them, affecting the validity of said letters-patent, or either of them, or for violating any previous patent by the use and enjoyment of the rights, interests, and privileges conveyed to said parties of the second part, by an assignment this day made to them by said party of the first part, or any alleged infringement of any other patent, he will . . assume and conduct at his own cost the defence against all such suits and proceedings, and keep and save entirely harmless and indemnified the said parties of the second part, their executors, administrators, and assigns, of and from all damages, costs, and expenses on account of the same; and further, that he will, whenever required by said parties of the second part or their assigns, sue any and all persons who shall infringe or violate, within the States of New York or Connecticut the said patent, or any patent or patents which may hereafter be obtained in respect to the subject-matter thereof, or of either of the same, in his own name or otherwise, but at his own cost or charge, and shall conduct the same for the use and benefit of said parties of the second part, their executors, administrators, and assigns; and he further agrees that in case the said letters-patent already granted, or any patents which may hereafter be obtained by him as aforesaid for the subject-matter thereof, shall be adjudged invalid, so as to deprive the said parties of the second part of the use and enjoyment of the rights and interests conveyed by the aforesaid assignment, that the agreements therein and herein contained on the part of said parties of the second part shall thereupon become void and of no further effect as against them or their assigns.
10
11
'2. That he will furnish to the said parties of the second part, before the first day of August next, at the cost price thereof, at the furnace of said parties of the second part, undressed castiron patterns for four several sizes of the coal-burner, patented in and by the aforesaid letters-patent, and embracing all the improvements therein for which letters-patent shall then have been secured, suitable to mould and cast from, and that he also will furnish at the place and price aforesaid, within a reasonable time after letters-patent have been secured by him therefor, undressed cast-iron patterns of the several sizes of all improvements upon said coal-burners which shall be made or invented by him.
11
12
'3. That he will pay the balance of the said indebtedness to said parties of the second part, over and above the said sum of $ in monthly instalments, from this date, of not less than $.
12
13
'The said parties of the second part hereby agree——
13
14
'1. That so long as the said party of the first part shall well and faithfully keep and perform all the agreements herein, and in said assignment bearing even date herewith, contained on his part, the premium of fifty cents upon each stove or coal-burner embracing the aforesaid inventions and improvements, which shall be sold by them, shall be retained and applied by them toward the payment of the said indebtedness of said party of the first part to them, to the extent and amount of $ and that after such amount shall have been thus paid they will pay to said party of the first part, his executors, administrators, or assigns, the premium or sum of fifty cents on each and every of said stoves or coal-burners which shall thereafter be sold by them; that they will keep a true account of all sales of said stoves or burners, which shall be open to the examination of the said party of the first part, and that a settlement of and for the premiums on said sales shall be made by them with said party of the first part, on the first day of April in each and every year hereafter.
14
15
'2. That they will also pay, in the manner and at the times aforesaid, the sum or premium of fifty cents upon every stove or burner, furnace, range, oven, or heater, of whatever kind or description that they may originate or construct upon the principle of the coal-burner, so patented as aforesaid, by said party of the first part, after patterns of their own design or contrivance, it being, however, hereby expressly understood and agreed by said parties of the second part, that nothing herein or in said assignment contained shall give to them the right to use or apply the principle of said coal-burner to furnaces that are used or erected in the cellars or basements of houses, for the purpose of heating several rooms or larger part of a dwelling-house, the same being intended to be reserved by said party of the first part.
15
16
'3. That they will, in case the said party of the first part shall well and truly keep and perform all the agreements on his part herein and in said assignment contained, manufacture and use all reasonable efforts to sell so many of said stoves or burners as the demand therefor will reasonably warrant and require; and that in case they or their assigns shall, without just cause, refuse, or after reasonable notice from said party of the first part, shall neglect to manufacture or sell said stoves or burners to such extent as aforesaid, then that the aforesaid assignment shall become inoperative and void, and this agreement shall cease and be of no further effect. But in that event, it is expressly understood and agreed that in case the said indebtedness of said party of the first part shall not then have been fully paid or satisfied to said parties of the second part, the same shall thereupon be at once due and payable, and that the payment thereof may be required by them from said party of the first part; provided, however, that such refusal or neglect shall occur for the reason that said stoves or burners cannot be sold by said parties of the second part on account of some practical defect in the principle thereof.'
16
17
The first of these two agreements, the grant, was duly recorded in the Patent Office, April The second, or supplementary agreement, was never recorded.
17
18
The application of Littlefield, dated December for an improvement in his first invention, and mentioned in the two documents, was rejected by the Patent Office, and on the 23d July, 1853, withdrawn by him.
18
19
On the same day that he thus withdrew it he filed a second application, it being for 'a new and useful improvement in stoves,' so devised as 'to burn the gaseous or more inflammable elements of the coal in contact with its more refractory portions, and thus secure a complete combustion of them both.'
19
20
The specification of this application, like that of the application rejected and withdrawn, stated that the patentee did not purpose to limit it to stoves for heating purposes alone, but to employ it wherever it could be advantageously applied, particularly to house furnaces, cooking-ranges, steamboat boilers, and stoves.
20
21
Upon this application a patent was issued, January h June, 1861, a patent for an improvement on this patent of was granted; and on the 9th November, of the same year, a reissue. Numerous other patents outstanding, and the subject of this controversy, were admitted to be reissues of this patent of or of patents for improvements upon it.
21
22
In this state of things, Treadwell & Perry, on the 25th of March, 1862, assigned all their interest to a certain George W. Sterling. He becoming dissatisfied with his purchase, the sale, by agreement, was cancelled, and he executed, June a reassignment to Treadwell & Perry. Intermediately, however, that is to say, on the 7th April, 1862, Treadwell & Perry had executed an assignment without any warranty of ownership to one Dickey. Both the reassignment from Sterling and the assignment to Dickey were left at the Patent Office for record on the 26th of June, 1862, and on the 2d July Dickey assigned all his interest to Mrs. Mary J. Perry, wife of John S. Perry; the Perry of the firm of Treadwell & Perry.
22
23
Littlefield having entered into partnership with one Jagger, and they two being engaged in making, within the States of New York and Connecticut, stoves under the patents of 15th April, 1851, 20th January, 1854, and June and under the patents for improvements on the inventions therein patented, and under the reissues of these several patents, Mrs. Perry, on the 27th of August, 1862,—alleging that the invention secured by the patent of April was regarded by Littlefield 'only as a germ from which a more valuable construction was to arise,' and that with a view of enhancing its value and utility he had proceeded soon afterwards with various experiments for improving the inventions secured by that patent, and that the subsequent patents and reissues were but for improvements on the original one, which subsequent improvements, with the original one, had passed to Treadwell & Perry by the 'grant,'—filed a bill in the court below against Littlefield & Jagger for injunction and account. Other improvements were patented, and reissues made pending the suit. Mrs. Perry having died during the suit, her husband, who was trustee under her will, was substituted as complainant. All the parties—complainant and defendants alike—were citizens of the State of New York. A supplemental bill filed after the date of reissues claimed the profits under them.
23
24
The assignment above mentioned of April to Dickey, was executed by Perry. Treadwell, in testimony, swore, more than once, that he assented to it.
24
25
For the benefit of the reader who may not recall the exact words of the Patent Acts, and the exact construction given to them, it may be well here to state——
25
t. That one of the Patent Acts enacts as follows:1
26
27
'Every patent shall be assignable in law either as to the whole interest or any undivided part thereof, by any instrument in writing; which assignment, and also every grant and conveyance of the exclusive right under any patent to make and use and to grant to others to make and use, the thing patented within and throughout any specified part or portion of the United States, shall be recorded in the Patent Office within three months from the execution thereof.
27
28
'All actions, suits, controversies, and cases arising under any law of the United States, granting or confirming to inventors the exclusive right to their inventions or discoveries, shall be originally cognizable, as well in equity as at law, by the Circuit Courts of the United States, or any District Court having the powers and jurisdiction of a Circuit Court.'
28
. That under the first of the above-cited sections, it has been judicially held2 that the patent is assignable only
29
30
(a) As to the whole interest, or an undivided part of such whole interest in every portion of the United States, OR
30
31
(b) As to an exclusive right within and throughout some specified part of the United States.
31
32
And that under the second of the above-cited sections, an assignee, either of the entire interest or of the exclusive right within a specified portion of the United States, may sue, in his own name, infringers in the Federal courts.
32
33
And that it has been further decided3 that a mere licensee cannot so sue, and that whenever a contract is made in reference to patent rights, which is not provided for or regulated by the preceding or other statute of the United States, the parties, if a dispute arise, stand as regards their right to sue in the Federal courts and otherwise, upon the same ground as other litigants.
33
34
The defendant accordingly set up either in answer or argument various defences—as,
34
35
I. That the grant and the supplemental agreement were one agreement; the latter being referred to in and making part of the former. That in consequence of the limitation and reservation made in the supplemental agreement (supra, p. , the right to use or apply the invention patented or applied for, given in the grant, was never given as to part of the invention, the part, namely, which applied 'to furnaces that are used or erected in the cellars or basements of houses for the purpose of heating several rooms or larger part of a dwelling-house; the same, continued the supplementary agreement, being intended to be reserved.' That neither the whole invention nor any undivided part of it being thus transferred, Treadwell & Perry were, under the above-quoted statute, which 'renders the monopoly capable of subdivision in the category of its locality, but in no other way,'4 not invested with such a title, as under the acts of Congress would give them a right to sue in the Federal courts; that the assignee must have the entire right within the territory specified; that they were mere licensees and unable under the Patent Acts to maintain a suit in their own name, or to give another this right; that accordingly no jurisdiction under the statute existed in the Circuit Courts to hear the case, both complainant and defendants being citizens of the same State.
35
36
II. That the fact that the contract between the parties did not vest in Treadwell & Perry any exclusive right in, or legal title to, or equitable right to perfect a title to any patent or invention, nor confer any right beyond that of licensees, appeared further, under decisions of the Federal courts, for the following reasons:
36
37
Because it was stipulated that the patentee should sue all infringers 'in his own name,' or otherwise; showing the intent of the patentee to retain the control of the patents.
37
38
Because he reserved a premium or royalty on each stove to be manufactured by Treadwell & Perry.
38
39
Because Treadwell & Perry were required to account to him in a particular manner for all stoves made and sold by them.
39
40
Because there was a provision by which the contract might become 'inoperative and void,' and by which 'all the rights and interests . . conveyed' were to 'revert' to the patentee, in the event that Treadwell & Perry neglected and refused to make and sell the stoves mentioned.
40
41
III. That the title was in Treadwell & Perry, inasmuch as Sterling, previously invested by them with a title, reassigned to them after they had assigned to Dickey, the argument here being that there was no actual warranty in the transfer to Dickey and none to be implied; that the transfer was in fact but a quit-claim, and that it was settled law that,
41
42
'If a possessor, without title, convey by quit-claim deed, and afterwards acquire good title, it does not inure to the benefit of the grantee.'5
42
43
IV. That the inventions which Littlefield & Jagger were using, were inventions under the patent of or reissues of it, or for improvements on inventions thus secured; and that the patent of was not for any 'improvement' upon the invention of the patent of or on the invention described in the application of or improvement of it, or reissues for either; the things alone transferred by the 'grant.'
43
44
[On this question of fact the defendants went into a great body of proof, exhibiting in court models of all the things at any time applied for, patented, or secured by reissues, with a great amount of parol evidence to show that the inventions which they were using were not 'improvements' on anything which had passed by the grant or supplementary agreement of but were essentially different inventions.]
44
45
V. That no rights now existed in the complainant, inasmuch as Treadwell & Perry had forfeited whatever rights the grant gave them, by not making and selling stoves as they had stipulated by the agreement to do.
45
46
[On this point some proofs were given, but it was not shown that Littlefield had given to them the notice required by the supplementary agreement, supra, p. ]
46
47
VI. That the supplemental bill, claiming the profits under the last reissues, extinguished and cancelled all claims for infringement of the original and prior reissues, since suits pending for the infringement of an original patent fall with its surrender for a reissue, because the foundation upon which they rest no longer exists.6 And that this cannot be helped by a supplemental bill.
47
48
The court having heard the case, directed an account of 'all the profits, gains, and advantages which the said defendants, or either of them, have received, or which have arisen or accrued to them, or either of them, from the manufacture, use, or sale of stoves within the States of New York and Connecticut, embracing the improvements described in and covered by the said letters-patent, and the reissues thereof, or any of them.'
48
49
The master, stating an account on these principles, found due to the complainants as of December the sum of $ the defendant giving little assistance in enabling him to arrive at the truth of things; and the court, overruling numerous exceptions to the report, some of form and some to the principles on which the account was stated, and approving it, added interest to the date of final decree; entering then, March a decree for $.
49
50
From that decree, John S. Perry, who, by substitution in the course of the proceeding, had, as already said, become complainant as trustee and executor of his wife, Mary, the original complainant, appealed.
50
51
Messrs. E. R. Hoar and H. E. Sickles, for the appellants; Messrs. E. W. Stoughton and J. H. Reynolds, contra.
51
52
The CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the court.
52
53
We are met at the outset of this case with a question of jurisdiction. All the parties, plaintiff as well as defendant, are citizens of the State of New York. The power of the Circuit Court, therefore, to entertain the cause, if it exists at all, must be found in the jurisdiction conferred by the patent laws.
53
54
The suit is in equity against a patentee by one who claims to be his assignee, to restrain him from infringing upon rights under his patent, which are alleged to have been assigned. The Circuit Court has jurisdiction of all suits arising under the patent laws, and has power, upon a bill in equity filed by a party aggrieved, to grant injunctions, according to the course and principles of courts of equity, to prevent the violation of any right secured by patent. Every patent, or any interest therein, is by statute made assignable by an instrument in writing, and the patentee or his assignee may, in like manner, grant and convey an exclusive right under his patent throughout any specified part of the United States. All such assignments must be recorded in the Patent Office within three mouths from the time of their execution. This power of assignment has been so construed by the courts as to confine it to the transfer of an entire patent, an undivided part thereof, or the entire interest of the patentee or undivided part thereof within and throughout a certain specified portion of the United States. One holding such an assignment is an assignee within the meaning of the statute, and may prosecute in the Circuit Court any action that may be necessary for the protection of his rights under the patent.
54
55
The title of the complainant in this case grows out of what is termed in the answers 'a grant and supplementary agreement,' executed in 'two parts,' between Littlefield, the patentee, and Treadwell & Perry. The 'grant' is one of the parts, and the 'supplementary agreement' the other. The grant, taken by itself, contains, in most unmistakable language, an absolute conveyance by the patentee of his patent and inventions described, and all improvements thereon, within and throughout the States of New York and Connecticut, and an agreement by the assignees to pay a royalty on all patented articles sold, with a clause of forfeiture in case of non-payment or neglect, after due notice, to make and sell the patented articles to the extent of a reasonable demand therefor. This grant was duly recorded in the Patent Office six days after its execution.
55
56
The supplementary agreement was never recorded. It contained, among other things, a stipulation to the effect that nothing in the assignment should give to Treadwell & Perry the right to use or apply the principle of the patent to furnaces erected in cellars or basements of houses for the purpose of heating several rooms, it being the intention of the patentee to reserve that to himself. It also contained certain other stipulations between the parties intended for the protection of their respective rights and the regulation of their conduct under the assignment. The defendants now contend that by reason of this reservation, and these several stipulations, the title of Treadwell & Perry, under the grant, has been reduced from that of assignees to mere licensees.
56
57
Undoubtedly, for the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the parties in making their contract, the two instruments, executed as they were at the same time, and each referring to the other, are to be construed together. If, when so construed, they shall be found to convey to the assignees the title to the patent and inventions and grant a license back from the assignees to the patentee of the right to use the patent and its principle in the manufacture of the designated furnaces, the Circuit Court had jurisdiction of the cause.
57
58
When the 'grant' was placed on record, Treadwell & Perry became the apparent owners of the entire patent and inventions throughout the specified territory. Neither the agreement to account and pay the royalty nor the clause of forfeiture for non-performance contained in that instrument reduced them to the position of licensees. The agreement to account and pay formed part of the consideration of the assignment, and was in effect an agreement to pay at a future time a sum to be determined by the number of articles made and sold. For the non-payment or other non-performance a forfeiture might be enforced as for condition broken, but until it was enforced the title granted remained in the assignees.
58
59
The supplementary agreement contained a provision that Littlefield should sue infringers 'in his own name or otherwise,' and also defend all suits against Treadwell & Perry for alleged infringements of other patents by the use of his, and this it is alleged is evidence of the intention of the parties to make the grant effective only as a license. It needs only a slight examination of that clause in the contract, however, to become satisfied that it was intended only as a provision for placing on Littlefield the costs and expenses of all such litigation, as well as all damages for infringements growing out of the use of the inventions by the assignees. The suits were to be prosecuted in his name, or otherwise, as circumstances should require, and he was to be at all the costs and expense of maintaining his patents. That is the extent of the provision.
59
60
Upon the argument, the reservation of the right to use the principle of the patent and inventions in the manufacture of furnaces seemed to be relied upon with more confidence as establishing this claim on the part of the defendants. All agree that the intention of the parties, when ascertained by an examination of both the instruments, must govern in this action where only the parties themselves are interested. There are no intervening innocent third persons. Jagger, the partner of Littlefield, who is codefendant with him, is charged with full notice of the rights of Treadwell & Perry, and others claiming under them.
60
61
It is a significant fact that the agreement was executed in two parts. Ordinarily the whole of such a contract is embodied in a single instrument. Another important fact is, that only one of the parts is recorded, and that the one which, taken by itself, places the title in Treadwell & Perry. The record is intended for the benefit of the public. Bon a fide purchasers look to it for their protection. The record of the grant alone, therefore, furnishes the strongest evidence of the intention of the parties to give effect to the two instruments as an assignment. It is true that in the recorded part reference is made to the other, but the manner of the reference is not such as to indicate that the unrecorded part contained anything to defeat the title granted by that which was recorded. The language is, 'in consideration of one dollar, and of the agreements herein contained on the part of the parties of the second part, and of the agreements contained in a certain agreement this day executed between the parties hereto, and bearing even date herewith, hath, and by these presents doth, assign,' &c. And again: 'It is expressly understood and agreed between the said parties that in case said party of the first part shall well and faithfully keep and perform all the agreements herein, and in the aforesaid agreement bearing even date herewith contained, and said parties of the second part shall, &c., neglect, &c., that this assignment and transfer shall thereafter be void and of no effect,' &c. This is undoubtedly sufficient to charge purchasers with notice of the execution of the supplementary agreement, and possibly of its provisions, but it falls far short of indicating an intention of the parties, by anything contained in the unrecorded instrument, to limit or defeat the assignment made in consideration of it. The most that can be inferred from such language is, that the parties had stipulated between themselves, not as to the legal effect of the recorded instrument, but as to their obligations or equitable rights under it. We think, therefore, that Treadwell & Perry were the assignees of Littlefield within the meaning of the patent laws, and that they and those claiming under them may sue in the Circuit Courts to prevent an infringement upon their rights.
61
62
But even if they are not technically assignees, we think this action is, nevertheless, maintainable. They certainly had the exclusive right to the use of the patent for certain purposes within their territory. They thus held a right under the patent. The claim is that this right has been infringed. To determine the suit, therefore, it is necessary to inquire whether there has been an infringement, and that involves a construction of the patents. The act of Congress provides 'that all actions, suits, controversies, and cases arising under any law of the United States granting or confirming to inventors the exclusive right to their inventions or discoveries shall be originally cognizable, as well in equity as at law, in the Circuit Courts,' &c. An action which raises a question of infringement is an action arising 'under the law,' and one who has the right to sue for the infringement may sue in the Circuit Court. Such a suit may involve the construction of a contract as well as the patent, but that will not oust the court of its jurisdiction. If the patent is involved it carries with it the whole case.
62
63
A mere licensee cannot sue strangers who infringe. In such case redress is obtained through or in the name of the patentee or his assignee. Here, however, the patentee is the infringer, and as he cannot sue himself, the licensee is powerless, so far as the courts of the United States are concerned, unless he can sue in his own name. A court of equity looks to substance rather than form. When it has jurisdiction of parties it grants the appropriate relief without regard to whether they come as plaintiff or defendant. In this case the person who should have protected the plaintiff against all infringements has become himself the infringer. He held the legal title to his patent in trust for his licensees. He has been faithless to his trust, and courts of equity are always open for the redress of such a wrong. This wrong is an infringement. Its redress involves a suit, therefore, arising under the patent laws, and of that suit the Circuit Court has jurisdiction.
63
64
It is next asserted that the complainant has not by his proof shown himself to be the assignee of Treadwell & Perry. They, on the 25th of March, 1862, assigned all their interest to George W. Sterling. He became dissatisfied with his purchase, and, by agreement of parties, the sale was cancelled, he giving effect to the cancellation by executing a reassignment to Treadwell & Perry, bearing date June Under date of April Treadwell & Perry executed another assignment to one Dickey. Both the reassignment from Sterling and the assignment to Dickey were left at the Patent Office for record on the 26th June, 1862, and on the 2d July Dickey assigned to Mary J. Perry, in whose name the suit was commenced.
64
65
It is now claimed that this proof shows title in Treadwell & Perry, inasmuch as Sterling reassigned to them after they had assigned to Dickey. Mrs. Perry was the wife of John S. Perry, one of the firm, and he is now a party to the suit, having upon her death succeeded to all her rights, as trustee under her will. Treadwell, the other member of the firm, has been several times in the progress of the cause examined as a witness, and has testified that Dickey became the owner of the patents under a transfer to which he consented. It is clear, therefore, that Mrs. Perry at the commencement of the action was in equity, if not in law, the owner of whatever had been assigned by Littlefield, and that if Treadwell & Perry had the legal title, they held it in trust for her, and will be estopped by a decree in her favor from setting up as against Littlefield any beneficial interest under it. At an earlier stage of the proceedings it might have been proper to make Treadwell a party, but upon the case as it now stands no possible harm can result to the defendants from a decree against them in his absence.
65
66
This brings us to a consideration of the merits of the case.
66
67
On the 15th April, 1851, a patent was issued to Littlefield for a certain improvement in cooking-stoves, and on the 30th December, 1852, he filed in the Patent Office his application for another improvement in stoves, devised 'for the purpose of economizing and burning the gases generated by the combustion of anthracite coals.' On the 5th April, 1853, he executed the grant and supplementary agreement already referred to. In the grant, after reciting that he held a patent bearing date April 'for a coal-burner so constructed as to produce combustion of the inflammable gases of anthracite coals,' and that he had 'made application to the Patent Office at Washington for letters-patent securing to him a certain improvement in the invention so as aforesaid patented to him,' and that such application was then pending, he proceeded to assign all the right, title, and interest which he then had, or might thereafter have, 'in or to the aforesaid inventions, improvement, and patent, or the patent or patents that may be granted for said inventions or any improvement therein, and on any extension or extensions thereof within and throughout the district, &c., for and during the term for which the aforesaid letters-patent were granted, and the terms for which any patent for the aforesaid improvement or any improvement or improvements thereof may be granted,' &c. The application of December was rejected at the Patent Office, and finally withdrawn by Littlefield on the 22d day of July, 1853, he at the same time filing another application for 'a new and useful improvement in stoves,' so devised as 'to burn the gaseous or more inflammable elements of the coal in contract with its more refractory portions, and thus secure a complete combustion of them both.' Upon this application a patent was issued January All the patents outstanding, and the subject of this controversy, are admitted to be reissues of this or improvements upon it. Littlefield and his codefendant do not deny that they have used the patents issued after January, 1854, and if the title to them passed under the assignment of April, 1853, it is admitted that such use is an infringement and that the complainant is entitled to a decree. The simple question, then, presented for our consideration is as to the effect to be given to this assignment.
67
68
It is well settled that a recorded assignment of a perfected invention, made before a patent has issued, carries with it the patent when issued,7 and that reissues are not patents for new inventions, but amendments of old patents. If a reissue is obtained with the consent of an assignee, it inures at once to his benefit; if without, he has his election to accept or reject it.
68
69
The parties have themselves agreed that the invention of is an improvement upon the patent of In the grant the patent is described as being 'for a coal-burner, so constructed as to produce combustion of the inflammable gases of anthracite coal,' and the application as being for an improvement upon the patent. It is true that the application is not referred to by its date, but there can be no doubt as to its identity, because the language adopted to describe the patent is not that of the claim in the patent itself, but of the application of Besides, the application is said to be then pending, and it is not pretended that Littlefield had any other on file in the Patent Office at that date. This relieves us from an examination of the specifications in the patent and application, for the purpose of ascertaining whether in point of fact the one was an improvement upon the other. Littlefield having agreed that it was, and having induced Treadwell & Perry to purchase by reason of this agreement, cannot now deny it.
69
70
It is clear, also, that the idea which Littlefield had in mind, and which he was endeavoring by his devices to make practically useful, was greater economy in the use of the inflammable gases of coal to produce combustion. It is not important in this suit that the patent, which had then been obtained, was not in fact suited for that purpose. It is sufficient that it was intended to be so. The subsequent devices, better adapted to the end to be accomplished, may therefore properly be regarded as improvements upon the original invention. They produce a stove doing the same thing which the first was intended to do, but doing it better. This is the proper office of an improvement.
70
71
The assignment in this case, by its express terms, covers all improvements in the original patent or the invention described in the application of It carried with it the legal title to the existing patent. If one had been issued upon the application, that, too, would have inured to the benefit of the assignee, because in that case it would have been the assignment of a perfected invention. Without considering whether the invention upon which the patent of issued was not, in fact, the same to all intents and purposes as that of it is sufficient for the purposes of this case that it was an improvement upon it, or perhaps more properly, that invention perfected. An assignment of an imperfect invention, with all improvements upon it that the inventor may make, is equivalent in equity to an assignment of the perfected results. The assignment in this case being such a one, the assignees became in equity the owners of the patent granted upon the perfected invention; that is to say, of the patent of Littlefield took the legal title in trust for them, and should convey. Courts of equity in proper cases consider that as done which should be. If there exists an obligation to convey at once, such courts will oftentimes proceed as if it had actually been made.
71
72
There is here no attempt to obtain the specific performance of a contract, but to restrain this patentee from infringing upon rights which, in a court of equity, he is deemed to have assigned. In other words, this complainant is in equity an assignee, and entitled to protection as such. If the assignment in precisely its present form had been executed after the last reissue was granted, we think it would hardly be claimed that the legal title to all the present outstanding patents did not pass with it. What such an assignment could do in respect to legal titles this has done in respect to such as are equitable. The contest is now between an assignor in equity and his assignee. A court of equity will in such a case give the same effect to an equitable title that it would to one that was legal.
72
73
It is next contended that the assignment in this case was forfeited before the commencement of this action, because of the failure of Treadwell & Perry to perform its conditions. There is no proof that the royalty on the stoves made and sold before the action was commenced was sufficient to discharge that part of the debt due from Littlefield to Treadwell & Perry, which was first to be paid out of it before anything was payable to him, and there could be no forfeiture for a neglect to make and sell, until after reasonable notice of the default. No such notice is proven or even claimed.
73
74
It is next insisted that if the plaintiff claims the benefit of the last reissues, he puts it out of his power to have damages for infringements previous to their date. The original bill in this cause was filed August Everything since that time has been done pendente lite. The first reissue was granted November and the first patent for an improvement on the patent of was issued on the 27th June previous. All in the way of reissues or improvements except these has been done pending the suit. The litigation gathers to its harvest the fruits of the labors of Littlefield and his associates during its pendency. His infringement and that of his codefendant Jagger, claiming under him, commenced in 1862, only a short time before the action was commenced. The question presented by this objection is, therefore, comparatively unimportant; but if it were not, the result would be the same. For as Littlefield held his patents all the time in trust for these assignees to the extent of the territory they owned, he must account to them for the profits he has made by the unlawful use of the trust property.
74
75
We are, therefore, clearly of the opinion that the complainant is in equity the assignee of Littlefield, and that he is entitled to recover of the defendants the profits they have made out of these infringements upon his rights. So far there is no error in the court below.
75
76
We now came to the decree itself. The plaintiff is entitled, as has been seen, to recover of the defendants the profits they have made from the use of the several inventions within the assigned territory; but the decree directed an account of 'all the profits, gains, and advantages which the said defendants, or either of them, have received, or which have arisen or accrued to them, or either of them, from the manufacture, use, or sale of stoves within the States of New York and Connecticut, embracing the improvements described in and covered by the said letters-patent, and the reissues thereof, or any of them.' An account stated upon these principles has been approved by the court in the decree appealed from.
76
77
The decree is, as we think, too broad. After the interlocutory decree below settling the principle of the accounting, the case of Mowry v. Whitney8 was decided in this court. It was there held that the question to be determined in such a case as this was, 'what advantage did the defendant derive from using the complainant's invention over what he had in using other processes then open to the public, and adequate to enable him to obtain an equally beneficial result? The fruits of that advantage are his profits.' For such profits he is compelled to account as damages.
77
78
Here the order is to account for all profits received from the manufacture, & c., of stoves, embracing the improvements covered by any of the patents. This would cover all the profits made upon a stove having in it any one of the improvements patented. The true inquiry is as to the profits which the defendants have realized as the consequence of the improper use of these improvements. Such profits belong to the plaintiff, and should be accounted for to him. The account of the master may not charge the defendants with more than the complainant is entitled to recover. The conduct of the defendants in withholding statements which it would seem they ought to be able to make, and their evident unwillingness to account, would induce us to sustain the report had the order of reference been less broad. As it is, we think the decree, so far as it settles the principles of the accounting for profits, must be reversed, and that the inquiry before the master must be confined to an account of the profits received by the defendants as the direct result of the use within the assigned territory of the several inventions involved in the case.
78
79
This reverses the decree.
79
80
Many exceptions were taken to the master's report. Some were as to the matters of form, and others were directed to the principles of the accounting as settled by the decree. It is unnecessary to consider these further. Another account may dispose of them all.
80
81
The Circuit Court, however, in rendering its final decree, added interest to the amount found by the master to be due upon the account for profits. In Mowry v. Whitney it was held that interest is not allowable in such cases, except under peculiar circumstances. The testimony thus far presented in this case does not, in our opinion, justify such an allowance. It will be for the court to determine, upon the coming in of the new report, accompanied by other evidence, whether the conduct of the defendants has been such as to subject them to liability in this particular. Profits actually realized are usually, in a case like this, the measure of unliquidated damages. Circumstances may, however, arise which would justify the addition of interest in order to give complete indemnity for losses sustained by wilful infringements.
81
82
DECREE REVERSED to the extent hereinbefore indicated, and the cause REMANDED, with instructions to take a new account of profits and proceed
82
83

RAILROAD LAND COMPANY
v.
COURTRIGHT.
October Term, 1874
1
The question for determination is, whether the plaintiff took a good title to the lands in controversy under the conveyance from the first company, the Iowa Central Air-Line Railroad Company, or whether that title is vested in the last company, the Iowa Railroad Land Company.
1
2
It is contended by the defendants, first, that under the act of Congress of May no lands could be sold by the State until twenty continuous miles of the road were constructed; second, that if one hundred and twenty sections could be sold in advance of such construction, they could only be taken from lands adjoining the line of the road from its commencement on the east; and third, that the grant by the State to the first company was upon conditions precedent, which not having been complied with, the title did not pass. Neither of these positions can, in our judgment, be maintained. The act of Congress by its express language authorized a sale of one hundred and twenty sections in advance of the construction of any part of the road. It was only as to the sale of the remaining sections that the provision requiring a previous completion of twenty miles applied. It is true it was the sole object of the grant to aid in the construction of the railroad, and for that purpose the sale of the land was only allowed, as the road was completed in divisions, except as to one hundred and twenty sections.
2
3
The evident intention of Congress in making this exception was to furnish aid for such preliminary work as would be required before the construction of any part of the road. No conditions, therefore, of any kind were imposed upon the State in the disposition of this quantity, Congress relying upon the good faith of the State to see that its proceeds were applied for the purposes contemplated by the act.
3
4
Nor was there any restriction upon the State as to the place where the one hundred and twenty sections should be selected along the line of the road, except that they should be included within a continuous length of twenty miles on each side. They might be selected from lands adjoining the eastern end of the road or the western end, or along the central portion.
4
5
The act of Congress of May was a grant to the State in praesenti; it passed a title to the odd sections designated, to be afterwards located. When the line of the road was fixed, and the location of the odd sections thus became certain, the title of the State acquired precision, and at once attached to the land. And the act of the State of July was also a grant in praesenti to the first railroad company. That company took the title and interests of the State upon the terms, conditions, and restrictions expressed in the act of Congress. The further conditions as to the completion of the road imposed by the State were conditions subsequent and not conditions precedent, as contended by the defendants. The terms, in which the right is reserved by the act of the State to resume the lands granted, imply what the previous language of the act declares, that a present transfer was made, and not one dependent upon conditions to be previously performed. The right is by them restricted to such lands as at the time of the resumption had not been previously disposed of. The resumption, therefore, of the grant by the failure of the first company to complete the road did not impair the title to the lands, which the act of Congress authorized to be sold in advance of such completion, and which were sold by that company.
5
6
We are of opinion, therefore, that the plaintiff took a good title to the premises in controversy by his conveyance from that company. The judgment of the court below is, therefore,
6
7
AFFIRMED.

MITCHELL
v.
UNITED STATES.
October Term, 1874
1
At the time when Mitchell passed within the rebel lines the war between the loyal and the disloyal States was flagrant. It speedily assumed the largest proportions. Important belligerent rights were conceded by the United States to the insurgents. Their soldiers when captured were treated as prisoners of war, and were exchanged and not held for treason. Their vessels when captured were dealt with by our prize courts. Their ports were blockaded and the blockades proclaimed to neutral nations. Property taken at sea, belonging to persons domiciled in the insurgent States, was uniformly held to be confiscable as enemy property. All these things were done as if the war had been a public one with a foreign nation.1 The laws of war were applied in like manner to intercourse on land between the inhabitants of the loyal and the disloyal States. It was adjudged that all contracts of the inhabitants of the former with the inhabitants of the latter were illegal and void. It was held that they conferred no rights which could be recognized. Such is the law of nations, flagrante bello, as administered by courts of justice.2
1
2
While such was the law as to dealings between the inhabitants of the respective territories, contracts between the inhabitants of the rebel States not in aid of the rebellion were as valid as those between themselves of the inhabitants of the loyal States. Hence this case turns upon the point whether the appellant was domiciled in the Confederate States when he bought the cotton in question.
2
3
When he took his departure for the South he lived and was in business at Louisville. He returned thither when Savannah was captured and his cotton was seized. It is to the intervening tract of time we must look for the means of solving the question before us. There is nothing in the record which tends to show that when he left Louisville he did not intend to return, or that while in the South he had any purpose to remain, or that when he returned to Louisville he had any intent other than to live there as he had done before his departure. Domicile has been thus defined: 'A residence at a particular place accompanied with positive or presumptive proof of an intention to remain there for an unlimited time.'3 This definition is approved by Phillimore in his work on the subject.4 By the term domicile, in its ordinary acceptation, is meant the place where a person lives and has his home.5 The place where a person lives is taken to be his domicile until facts adduced establish the contrary.6
3
4
The proof of the domicile of the claimant at Louisville is sufficient. There is no controversy between the parties on that proposition. We need not, therefore, further consider the subject.
4
5
A domicile once acquired is presumed to continue until it is shown to have been changed.7 Where a change of domicile is alleged the burden of proving it rests upon the person making the allegation.8 To constitute the new domicile two things are indispensable: First, residence in the new locality; and, second, the intention to remain there. The change cannot be made except facto et animo. Both are alike necessary. Either without the other is insufficient. Mere absence from a fixed home, however long continued, cannot work the change. There must be the animus to change the prior domicile for another. Until the new one is acquired, the old one remains.9 These principles are axiomatic in the law upon the subject.
5
6
When the claimant left Louisville it would have been illegal to take up his abode in the territory whither he was going. Such a purpose is not to be presumed. The presumption is the other way. To be established it must be proved.10 Among the circumstances usually relied upon to establish the animus manendi are: Declarations of the party; the exercise of political rights; the payment of personal taxes; a house of residence, and a place of business.11 All these indicia are wanting in the case of the claimant.
6
7
The rules of law applied to the affirmative facts, without the aid of the negative considerations to which we have adverted, are conclusive against him. His purchase of the cotton involved the same legal consequences as if it had been made by an agent whom he sent to make it.

JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

ROBINSON ET AL.
v.
ELLIOTT.
October Term, 1874
1
'It appears to us this instruction was calculated to confuse and mislead the jury to the prejudice of the defendant. . If it was intended to say that the defendant could not hold possession after the date of the mortgage, it is certainly erroneous. If some other point of time was intended to be indicated at which the possession of the defendant should cease to be rightful, it should have been more specific, especially in view of the fact that the date when the debts secured by the mortgage were to become due is not stated particularly, and the right to retain said possession was to remain in the mortgagor until the maturity and failure to pay said debts.'
1
2
The case was reversed for the error contained in the instruction given.
2
3
It must be admitted that this opinion of the Supreme Court, in which the judge undertakes to state the case, is wanting in perspicuity in the statement of the facts. But the record clearly shows that the validity of the mortgage was in question; and that the Circuit Court had assumed in its instruction, just as the circuit judge has decided here, that if the mortgagor after the mortgage was executed, kept possession of the goods and sold and dealt with them as his own, the mortgage would be fraudulent and void.
3
4
If we are right as to what is the law in Indiana on this question, and if the validity of the mortgage is to be settled, as of course it is to be, by that law, we may rest the argument here. As for the authority of cases decided in other States of the Union that the mortgage is invalid, it is enough to say that the opinion of the Supreme Court of Maine,4 the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, with Shaw as its chief,5 the Supreme Court of Michigan, with Cooley as its chief,6 the Supreme Court of Iowa, with Dillon as its chief,7 the Circuit Court of the United States for the first circuit, Story, J., presiding;8 and the Supreme Court of Indiana, the State where, and under whose statutes the question arises, are arrayed against the vacillating and unsatisfactory rulings of New York, rendered under peculiar constructions of their statutes, against the cases in Illinois, under their very peculiar statutes, and the cases in Ohio, and perhaps Wisconsin and Missouri, following the same line of argument.
4
5
Mr. W. E. Niblack, contra, contended——
5
6
That no question about the respective domains of law and fact could arise in this case; the proceeding being by bill in chancery, and the case being made by a demurrer to it.
6
7
That while in Maple v. Burnside, relied on by the other side, the case was so confusedly stated, that it was difficult to say exactly what it was, there was nothing in the report to show that the mortgage contained any provision permitting the mortgagee to remain in possession and deal with the goods, and that the judgment established no right in a mortgagor of chattels even in Illinois to do so.
7
8
That the tenth section of the statute of Indiana did not change this rule of the common law, and that the argument of the plaintiff in error went to the extent of allowing the enactment, that a mortgage of chattels, where possession did not accompany the title, should nevertheless be valid when recorded, to set up as valid every fraudulent device which under the aspect of a mortgage might be put on record in pursuance of the statute.
8
9
That from the case of Grantham v. Hawley, decided so far back as the time of Hobart,9 it had been settled that a mortgage was void as to after-acquired property except where the mortgagor had a present actual interest in it or concerning it; that there must be something in praesenti of which the thing in futuro was to be the product, or with which it was to be connected as necessary for its use, or as incident to it, constituting a tangible, existing basis for the contract. The future property must be an accretion to the property already owned by the mortgagor, either by adding the future to the present, or by growth. Thus, to take Hobart's illustration, that while one might mortgage all the wool which should grow for a term of years on any number of sheep owned by him at the time, he could not mortgage the wool to be grown on any sheep at all if he did not own them; a position for the principle of which the counsel cited cases from nearly every State in the Union.
9
10
And in short, that although the question might appear, to some extent, an open one in Indiana, a reference to the notes, English and American, upon Twyne's case in Smith's Leading Cases,10 would show that the judicial mind of both England and the United States had ascertained and fixed the rule that after-acquired chattels were not subject to lien by way of mortgage; that this rule was moreover a wise one, since to sanction a contrary rule and so to give effect to transactions like the one under consideration, would open a door to frauds innumerable and of the most extensive sort.
10
11
Mr. Justice DAVIS delivered the opinion of the court.
11
12
There are few subjects which have been more discussed in the courts of this country, with less uniformity of decision, than that of sales and mortgages of personal goods, without delivery of possession. In Indiana the statute of 13th Elizabeth has been adopted, and two provisions applicable to this case engrafted on it. The first declares that 'no assignment of goods by way of mortgage shall be valid against any other person that the parties thereto, when such goods are not delivered to the mortgagee, or assignee, and retained by him, unless such assignment or mortgage' shall be duly recorded. And the second says, 'that the question of fraudulent intent in all cases shall be deemed a question of fact.'
12
13
Prior to the incorporation of these provisions in the statute it was necessary to the validity of chattel mortgages in Indiana that there should be a manual delivery of the mortgaged property to the mortgagee, who should continue to hold the same in his possession. These provisions changed the law in this particular, and permitted the retention of the possession of personal property by the mortgagor in a chattel mortgage given as a security for the payment of debts. And there can be no question that in Indiana a mortgage, which simply allows the mortgagor to retain the possession and use of the property until breach of the condition is, when duly recorded, prim a facie valid. But it is insisted that the effect of these provisions is also to make a mortgage of a stock of goods, containing a provision authorizing the mortgagor to retain possession for the purpose of selling in the usual course of trade, prim a facie valid, and that the court cannot, as a matter of law, pronounce it fraudulent. This, we think, is going beyond what the legislature intended. If registration was intended, as we think it was, as a substitute for delivery of possession, it was not meant to be a protection for all the other stipulations contained in a mortgage. If so, it could be used as a cover for any fraudulent transaction, which would have to be treated, on the theory advanced, as valid, until the contrary was shown.
13
14
It is true the law conferred on the parties the right to agree that the possession of the property could remain with the mortgagor, provided the mortgage be recorded; but if the mortgage contains other provisions, which, on legal principles, vitiates the whole instrument, it is difficult to see how recording it could make it even prim a facie valid. The Bill of Sales Registration Act in England makes void all bills of sale not filed as required, if unaccompanied by possession. An eminent writer in speaking of this act says: 'Of course the mere fact of due registration of a bill of sale, under this act, does not necessarily make it good against creditors. The act was not passed with a view of making good a title which was not good before, but for the protection of creditors.'11 And to the same effect is Wood v. Lowry.12
14
15
It is argued, however, that there can be no such thing in this class of cases as constructive fraud, because under the statute the question of fraudulent intent is one of fact. But the Supreme Court of Indiana has decided the question differently. The statute of that State for the prevention of frauds embraces twenty-two sections. The tenth relates to the registration of chattel mortgages; the seventeenth enacts that every assignment, &c., of any estate in lands, or of goods, made with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, shall be void; and the twenty-first declares that the question of fraudulent intent, in all cases arising under the provisions of this act, shall be deemed a question of fact. It will thus be seen that the last section applies to conveyances of land as well as to assignments of goods by way of mortgage. In Jenners and others v. Doe on the demise of Pomeroy and others,13 the question was whether a deed of trust on certain lands was void as to creditors who did not consent to it. The court of original jurisdiction held the deed void upon its face as a question of law. It was contended that this ruling was erroneous, and that in all cases the instrument must be referred to the jury in connection with the facts. But the Supreme Court held the ruling to be correct. They say that the provisions embraced in the seventeenth and twenty-first sections of the statute have declared, not changed, the law on the subject; that the court must, in the first instance, determine upon the legal effect of a written instrument, and if that be to delay creditors it is rejected. If, however, on its face it conforms to the law, it is received in evidence, and the question of the intent with which it was executed is an open one for the jury. It would seem to be the view of the court in this case, as well as in the preceding one in the same volume, of Nutter v. Harris, that the twenty-first section applies to cases of actual or meditated and intentional fraud, and is not applicable to written instruments which the law adjudges to be fraudulent on their face and consequently void.
15
16
There is, therefore, nothing in the way of the consideration of the main question involved in this controversy on its merits.

If chattel mortgages were formerly, in most of the States, treated as invalid unless actual possession was surrendered to the mortgagee, it is not so now, for modern legislation has, as a general thing (the cases to the contrary being exceptional) conceded the right to the mortgagor to retain possession, if the transaction is on good consideration and bon a fide. This concession is in obedience to the wants of trade, which deem it beneficial to the community that the owners of personal property should be able to make bon a fide mortgages of it, to secure creditors, without any actual change of possession.

But the creditor must take care in making his contract that it does not contain provisions of no advantage to him, but which benefit the debtor, and were designed to do so, and are injurious to other creditors. The law will not sanction a proceeding of this kind. It will not allow the creditor to make use of his debt for any other purpose than his own indemnity. If he goes beyond this, and puts into the contract stipulations which have the effect to shield the property of his debtor, so that creditors are delayed in the collection of their debts, a court of equity will not lend its aid to enforce the contract. These principles are not disputed, but the courts of the country are not agreed in their application to mortgages, with somewhat analogous provisions to the one under consideration. The cases cannot be reconciled, by any process of reasoning, or on any principle of law. As the question has never before been presented to this court, we are at liberty to adopt that rule on the subject which seems to us the safest and wisest. It is not difficult to see that the mere retention and use of personal property until default is altogether a different thing from the retention of possession accompanied with a power to dispose of it for the benefit of the mortgagor alone. The former is permitted by the laws of Indiana, is consistent with the idea of security, and may be for the accommodation of the mortgagee; but the latter is inconsistent with the nature and character of a mortgage, is no protection to the mortgagee, and of itself furnishes a pretty effectual shield to a dishonest debtor. We are not prepared to say that a mortgage under the Indiana statute would not be sustained which allows a stock of goods to be retained by the mortgagor, and sold by him at retail for the express purpose of applying the proceeds to the payment of the mortgage debt. Indeed, it would seem that such an arrangement, if honestly carried out, would be for the mutnal advantage of the mortgagee and the unpreferred creditors. But there are features engrafted on this mortgage which are not only to the prejudice of creditors, but which show that other considerations than the security of the mortgagees, or their accommodation even, entered into the contract. Both the possession and right of disposition remain with the mortgagors. They are to deal with the property as their own, sell it at retail, and use the money thus obtained to replenish their stock. There is no covenant to account with the mortgagees, nor any recognition that the property is sold for their benefit. Instead of the mortgage being directed solely to the bon a fide security of the debts then existing, and their payment at maturity, it is based on the idea that they may be indefinitely prolonged. As long as the bank paper could be renewed, Robinson consented to be bound, and in Mrs. Sloan's case it was not expected that the debt would be paid at maturity, but that it would be renewed from time to time, as the parties might agree. It is very clear that the instrument was executed on the theory that the business could be carried on as formerly by the continued indorsement of Robinson, and that Mrs. Sloan was indifferent about prompt payment. The correctness of this theory is proved by the subsequent conduct of the parties, for the mortgagees remained in possession of the property, and bought and sold and traded in the manner of retail dry-goods merchants, from July to August During this period of twenty-five months Robinson indorsed as usual, and Mrs. Sloan was content with the payment of a small portion of the principal of her debt. Instead of getting it renewed, as contemplated by the mortgage, she seems to have been willing to let it remain dishonored, and the fair inference from the averments of the bill is that Robinson would have continued to indorse, and Mrs. Sloan exhibit the same easy indifference on the subject of her indebtedness, if the death of Seth Coolidge had not dissolved the firm and compelled an inventory and appraisement, showing the desperate condition of the mortgagors. It hardly need be said that a moargage which, by its very terms, authorizes the parties to accomplish such objects is, to say the least of it, constructively fraudulent.

Manifestly it was executed to enable the mortgagors to continue their business and appear to the world as the absolute owners of the goods, and enjoy all the advantages resulting therefrom. It is idle to say that a resort to the record would have shown the existence of the mortgage, for men get credit by what they apparently own and possess, and this ownership and possession had existed without interruption for ten years. There was nothing to put creditors on their guard. On the contrary, this long-continued possession and apparent ownership were well calculated to create confidence and disarm suspicion. But apart from this, security was not the leading object. If so, why does Mrs. Sloan's note remain overdue for twenty-one months, and why does Robinson continue to indorse? This conduct is the result of trust and confidence, which, as Lord Coke tells us, are ever found to constitute the apparel and cover of fraud.

In truth, the mortgage, if it can be so called, is but an expression of confidence, for there can be no real security where there is no certain lien.

21
Whatever may have been the motive which actuated the parties to this instrument, it is manifest that the necessary result of what they did do was to allow the mortgagors, under cover of the mortgage, to sell the goods as their own, and appropriate the proceeds to their own purposes; and this, too, for an indefinite length of time. A mortgage which, in its very terms, contemplates such results, besides being no security to the mortgagees, operates in the most effectual manner to ward off other creditors; and where the instrument on its face shows that the legal effect of it is to delay creditors, the law imputes to it a fraudulent purpose. The views we have taken of this case harmonize with the English common-law doctrine, and are sustained by a number of American decisions. In the American editor's note to Twyne's case,14 most of the cases in this country on the subject are collected and classified.15

It is contended by the appellants that the rulings of the Indiana courts are in favor of the validity of this mortgage, and the main case relied on to support this position is Maple v. Burnside. The facts of this case are stated in the opinion of the court in a way to render it difficult for any practitioner outside of the State to understand the application to them of the legal rules which are discussed, but there is nothing to show that the mortgage there considered contained any provision permitting the mortgagor to remain in possession of the property and deal with it as his own, nor does the judgment of the court involve any such question. The case would seem to be chiefly valuable as an authoritative exposition of certain points of nisi prius practice. Although we have been unable to find any case from Indiana of similar facts with the one at bar, yet the decision in the New Albany Insurance Company v. Wilcoxson,16 would seem to imply that when such a case did arise it would be decided in accordance with the views we have presented. The point ruled in that case is, that if a mortgage is executed merely to protect property in the hands of the mortgagor from his creditors other than the mortgagee, the mortgagor retaining possession and the right of disposition, and these facts appear upon the face of the mortgage, it would be fraudulent and void as against other creditors, and should be so declared by the court. And the court, to sustain this proposition, refer to Freeman v. Rawson,17 a standard authority in this class of cases, for the views we have advanced on this subject.

Finally, it is insisted if the mortgage is held void in law, still the delivery of the goods in pledge vests a sufficient lien, prim a facie, to enable the appellants to enforce their lien in equity.
23
24
The answer to this is, that the case made by the bill does not proceed upon such a delivery at all, but upon the mortgage and seizure under it. Besides, if the appellants could turn the proceeding into a voluntary pledge by the debtors, it would not help them, for it would violate the preference clause of the Bankrupt Act, as they got the goods only twelve days before the petition in bankruptcy was filed.

DECREE AFFIRMED.
