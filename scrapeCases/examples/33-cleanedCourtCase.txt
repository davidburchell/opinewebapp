H. E. CROOK CO., Inc.,
v.
UNITED STATES.
Argued Jan 12, 1926.
1
This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims, taken under section of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. § before that section was repealed by the Act of February The claim is for damages due to delay in enabling the plaintiff to perform a contract. The Court of Claims held that the plaintiff waived any claim that it might have had by going on with the work without protest and without taking any steps to protect itself. The government contends that by the terms of the contract it was not bound to pay damages for delay.

The contract was that the plaintiff should furnish and install heating systems, 'one in the Foundry Building, and one in the Machine Shop at the Navy Yard, Norfolk, Virginia.' It allowed tow hundred days from the date of delivering a copy to the plaintiff for the work to be completed. A copy was delivered on August 31, 1917, making March 19, 1918, the day for completion. But it was obvious on the face of the contract that this date was provisional. The Government reserved the right to make changes and to interrupt the stipulated continuity of the work. Wells Brothers Co. v. United States, The contract showed that the specific buildings referred to were in process of construction by contractors who might not keep up to time. 'The approximate contract date of completion for the foundry' is stated to be March 17, 1918, and that for the machine shop, February 15, 1918. The same dates were fixed for completing the heating systems, but the heating apparatus had to conform to the structure, of course, so that if the general contractors were behindhand the heating also would be delayed. They were behindhand nearly a year. When such a situation was displayed by the contract it was not to be expected that the Government should bind itself to a fixed time for the work to come to an end, and there is not a word in the instrument by which it did so, unless an undertaking contrary to what seems to us the implication is implied.
2
3
The Government did fix the time very strictly for the contractor. It is contemplated that the contractor may be unknown, and he must satisfy the Government of his having the capital, experience, and ability to do the work. Much care is taken therefore to keep him up to the mark. Liquidated damages are fixed for his delays. But the only reference to delays on the Government side is in the agreement that if caused by its acts they will be regarded as unavoidable, which though probably inserted primarily for the contractor's benefit as a ground for extension of time, is not without a bearing on what the contract bound the Government to do. Delays by the building contractors were unavoidable from the point of view of both parties to the contract in suit. The plaintiff agreed to accept in full satisfaction for all work done under the contract the contract price, reduced by damages deducted for his delays and increased or reduced by the price of changes, as fixed by the Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Works. Nothing more is allowed for changes, as to which the Government is master. It would be strange if it were bound for more in respect of matters presumably beyond its control. The contract price, it is said in another clause, shall cover all expenses of every nature connected with the work to be done. Liability was excluded expressly for utilities that the Government promised to supply. We are of opinion that the failure to exclude the present claim was due to the fact that the whole frame of the contract was understood to shut it out, although in some cases the Government's lawyers have been more careful. Wood v. United States, L. Ed. The plaintiff's time was extended and it was paid the full contract price. In our opinion it is entitled to nothing more.

MANDELBAUM
v.
UNITED STATES.
Argued Jan. 15, 1926.
1
This is a suit brought in the District Court under its jurisdiction concurrent with the Court of Claims (Judicial Code, § 24, twentieth; Act of March (Comp. St. § ) to recover on War Saving Certificates with stamps attached, issued under the Acts of September and of September (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. ). The certificates fell due on January 1, 1923, but were stolen in the preceding year. They bore the name of the plaintiff or of different members of his family who had transferred their claim to him, but they were not registered. The plaintiff offers to give a sufficient bond of indemnity. The bill was dismissed by the District Court and the decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals on the ground that the right to recover was excluded by the certificates on their face. 
1
2
The certificates were sheets with blanks for the affixing of stamps issued by the Government for the purpose, face value five dollars each. They were not valid without one stamp affixed, and there were blanks for twenty in all, which could be added from time to time if and when desired. The certificate declared that, subject to the conditions thereon, the owner named on the back would be entitled on January 1, 1923, to receive the amount indicated by the stamps. Among the conditions are provisions for registration and notice that unless registered the United States will not be liable for payment to one not the owner; that upon payment the certificate must be surrendered and a receipt signed by the owner; and that upon satisfactory evidence of the loss of a registered certificate the owner shall be entitled to payment of the registered amount. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that these conditions very plainly imported what on January 21, 1918, was embodied by the Secretary of the Treasury in an authorized regulation, that unregistered certificates would not be paid if lost. There was good reason for the condition. The stamps are undistinguishable one from another. Therefore they could be detached and put upon another certificate, and it would be impossible for the Government to know whether the stolen stamps that gave the value to the certificate had been paid or not. The offer of indemnity was illusory, and the case is not like that of a lost bond. The condition limited the obligation of the Government to pay and until it is complied with the plaintiff must put up with his loss.

STATE OF MARYLAND
v.
SOPER, District Judge, et al.
270 U.S. 45
COLE et al.
v.
NORBORNE LAND DRAINAGE DIST. OF CARROLL COUNTY, MO., et al.
Argued Jan. 20, 1926.
1
This is a bill to restrain the collection of a tax and entry upon the plaintiffs' lands in pursuance of a plan of drainage established in the mode provided by the laws of Missouri. The grounds on which relief is sought are that section 40 of the Drainage Laws of , under which the plaintiffs' lands were brought into the drainage district, is contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the inclusion of their lands was an arbitrary exercise of power for the purpose of making the plaintiffs pay for benefits that they did not share. The District Court found that there was no arbitrary exercise of power, but only a decision upon disputable questions of benefit with regard to land all of which was Missouri bottom land, similar in condition in everything but degree. It upheld the inclusion of the plaintiffs' land. In view of the constitutional question raised the plaintiffs appealed directly to this Court.
1
2
Under the laws of the State a drainage district was incorporated which originally contained, it is said, acres. In a later year, upon petition of the supervisors of the district, the boundaries were enlarged in due statutory form so as to take in nearly acres more of adjoining land, including that now concerned. It is not disputed that the original district was lawful in all respects. In general there can be no doubt that a State has power to add more land that shares the benefit of a scheme, to the lawfully constituted district that has to pay for it, and to do so against the will of the owner. Houck v. Little River Drainage District, Squaw Creek Drainage District v. Turney, Mudd v. St. Francis Drainage District, Faithorn v. Thompson. 
2
3
But it is objected that as in this case the original district was formed on the petition of the 'owners of a majority of the acreage' in contiguous lands, and as, under the statute, the concurrence of the owners of a majority of the acreage was necessary, there is an unconstitutional discrimination in not leaving it to a similar majority to determine whether the new land shall come in. It seems strange if the power of the Legislature to add to a lawfully existing district depends on how that district was formed many years before. But it is enough to repeat the answer of the appellees. The original incorporators take the risk of a plan and agree to pay for it while as yet they do not know exactly what that the plan will be or what the benefits. If after the plan is made and started it becomes obvious that other contiguous land will be benefited, it is just that such land should help to pay the bills. But only an Eighteenth Century faith in human nature could expect that the owners would vote to come in and pay their shares when they would get the same benefit if they stayed out. The discrimination is justified by the change in position at the later time.
3
4
As to the supposed sinister purpose of those who brought the plaintiffs in, no evidence was given to prove it. That the plaintiffs' land would be benefited has been found by the Circuit Court of Carroll County, Missouri, which made the order, and by the District Court below. We see no reason in the evidence for not accepting their findings. There is another objection to inquiring further. By the law of Missouri the decree of the Circuit Court is final with regard to the territorial extent of the district. The bill further states that the plaintiffs have sought redress in the courts of the State without avail. The defendants plead that the plaintiffs sued in a State Court to cancel the assessments upon them and to annul the judgment of the Circuit Court; that thereupon the defendants applied to the Supreme Court for a writ of prohibition, and that the Court made the prohibition absolute, upholding the constitutionality of the law. State ex rel. Norborne Land Drainage District v. Hughes, The defendants urge these facts to show that the plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law by bringing either the judgment of the Circuit Court or that of the Supreme Court here. It is hard to see why these decisions do not make the question sought to be opened here res judicata, although not so pleaded. But in any event we see no ground for disturbing the decree below. The District Court rightly held that the plaintiffs Hellwig and Summers must fail for the additional reason that the assessments against them were less than the jurisdictional amount, but this is not very important as on the merits the bill must be dismissed.

UNITED STATES
v.
HOLT STATE BANK et al.
Decided February 1, 1926.
1
This is a bill in equity by the United States to quiet in it the title to the bed of Mud Lake-now drained and uncovered-in Marshall county, Minnesota, and to enjoin the defendants from asserting any claim thereto. After answer and a hearing the District Court entered a decree dismissing the bill on the merits. The United States appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, where the decree was affirmed (, and then by a further appeal brought the case here.
1
2
Mud Lake is within what formerly was known as the Red Lake Indian Reservation, which had an area exceeding acres and was occupied by certain bands of the Chippewas of Minnesota. Most of the reservation, including the part in the vicinity of Mud Lake, was relinquished and ceded by the Chippewas comformably to the Act of January for the purposes and on the terms stated in that act. It provided that the lands when ceded should be surveyed, classified as 'pine lands' and 'agricultural lands,' and disposed of in designated modes; that such as were classified as agricultural should be disposed of under the homestead law at a price of $an acre; and that the net proceeds of all, whether classified as pine or agricultural, should be put into an interest-bearing trust fund for the Chippewas and ultimately disbursed for their benefit or distributed among them.
2
3
The cession became effective through the President's approval March 4, 1890. Thereafter the lands in the vicinity of Mud Lake were surveyed and platted in the usual way; the lake being meandered and represented on the plat as a lake. The tracts bordering on the lake were classified as agricultural, opened to homestead entry, and disposed of to homestead settlers; patents being issued in due course. The defendants now own and hold these tracts under the patents. After the homestead entries were allowed, and after most of them were carried to patent, the lake was drained and its bed made bare by a public ditch constructed under the drainage laws of the state. The United States then surveyed the bed with the purpose of disposing of it for the benefit of the Indians under the act of and later brought this suit to clear the way for such a disposal.
3
4
The lake in its natural condition covered an area of almost acres and was traversed by Mud river, a tributary of Thief river, which was both navigable in itself and directly connected with other navigable streams leading to the western boundary of the state and thence along that boundary to the British possessions on the north.
4
5
The ditch which drained the lake was established as a means of fitting for cultivation a large body of swamp lands in that general vicinity. It is as much as 30 miles long, and, like Mud river, passes through the lake and discharges into Thief river. Its depth exceeds that of the lake, and its width and fall are such that it has drawn the water out of the lake. Its construction was begun in 1910, and was so far completed in 1912 that the lake was then effectively drained.
5
6
The swamp lands which the ditch was intended to reclaim were within the ceded portion of the Red Lake Reservation. Some had been disposed of under the act of and thus had passed into private ownership; but the absence of necessary drainage was preventing or retarding the disposal of the others. Congress caused an examination to be made to determine whether drainage was physically and economically feasible (Act June and Act March , and a report of the examination was made (H. R. Doc. No. Sess.). Shortly thereafter Congress gave its assent to the drainage of the lands under the laws of the state by declaring that all lands not entered and all entered lands for which a final certificate had not issued should 'be subject to all of the provisions of the laws of said state relating to the drainage of swamp or overflowed lands for agricultural purposes to the same extent and in the same manner in which lands of a like character held in private ownership are or may be subject to said laws.' Act May (Comp. St. § .
6
7
The laws of the state, to the application of which assent was thus given, authorized the establishment of public drainage ditches by judicial proceedings and provided that such ditches might be so established as to widen, deepen, change or drain any river or lake, even if navigable and whether meandered or not. Laws Gen. Stat. et seq. The ditch which drained Mud Lake was established by judicial proceedings begun under these laws after the congressional consent was given, and it is not questioned that those proceedings made it entirely lawful to construct the ditch through the lake and to drain it as an incident of the reclamation project in hand.
7
8
The defendants insist that the lake in its natural condition was navigable, that the state, on being admitted into the Union, became the owner of its bed, and that under the laws of the state the defendants, as owners of the surrounding tracts, have succeeded to the right of the state. On the other hand, the United States insists that the lake never was more than a mere marsh, that the state never acquired any right to it, that the surveyor should have extended the survey over it when he surveyed the adjacent lands, and that the United States is entitled and in duty bound to dispose of it under the act of for the benefit of the Chippewas.
8
9
Both courts below resolved these contentions in favor of the defendants; and whether they erred in this is the matter for decision here.
9
10
It is settled law in this country that lands underlying navigable waters within a state belong to the state in its sovereign capacity and may be used and disposed of as it may elect, subject to the paramount power of Congress to control such waters for the purposes of navigation in commerce among the states and with foreign nations, and subject to the qualification that where the United States, after acquiring the territory and before the creation of the state, has granted rights in such lands by way of performing international obligations, or effecting the use or improvement of the lands for the purposes of commerce among the states and with foreign nations, or carrying out other public purposes appropriate to the objects for which the territory was held, such rights are not cut off by he subsequent creation of the state, but remain unimpaired, and the rights which otherwise would pass to the state in virtue of its admission into the Union are restricted or qualified accordingly. Barney v. Keokuk, Shively v. Bowlby, L. Ed. Scott v. Lattig, L. Ed. Port of Seattle v. Oregon & Washington R. Co., L. Ed. Brewer-Elliott Oil & Gas Co. v. United States, L. Ed. 
10
11
But, as was pointed out in Shively v. Bowlby, at pages , the United States early adopted and constantly has adhered to the policy of regarding lands under navigable waters in acquired territory, while under its sole dominion, as held for the ultimate benefit of future states, and so has refrained from making any disposal thereof, save in exceptional instances when impelled to particular disposals by some international duty or public exigency. It follows from this that disposals by the United States during the territorial period are not lightly to be inferred, and should not be regarded as intended unless the intention was definitely declared or otherwise made very plain.
11
12
The state of Minnesota was admitted into the Union in , and under the constitutional principle of equality among the several states the title to the bed of Mud Lake then passed to the state, if the lake was navigable, and if the bed had not already been disposed of by the United States.
12
13
Both courts below found that the lake was navigable. But they treated the question of navigability as one of local law to be determined by applying the rule adopted in Minnesota. We think they applied a wrong standard. Navigability, when asserted as the basis of a right arising under the Constitution of the United States, is necessarily a question of federal law to be determined according to the general rule recognized and applied in the federal courts. Brewer-Elliott Oil & Gas Co. v. United States, supra, at page . To treat the question as turning on the varying local rules would give the Constitution a diversified operation where uniformity was intended. But notwithstanding the error below in accepting a wrong standard of navigability, the findings must stand if the record shows that according to the right standard the lake was navigable.
13
14
The rule long since approved by this court in applying the Constitution and laws of the United States is that streams or lakes which are navigable in fact must be regarded as navigable in law; that they are navigable in fact when they are used, or are susceptible of being used, in their natural and ordinary condition, as highways for commerce, over which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water; and further that navigability does not depend on the particular mode in which such use is or may be had-whether by steamboats, sailing vessels or flatboats-nor on an absence of occasional difficulties in navigation, but on the fact, if it be a fact, that the stream in its natural and ordinary condition affords a channel for useful commerce. The Montello, L. Ed. 391; United States v. Cress, L. Ed. Economy Light & Power Co. v. United States, L. Ed. Oklahoma v. Texas, L. Ed. Brewer-Elliott Oil & Gas Co. v. United States, supra, p. 
14
15
The evidence set forth in the record is voluminous and in some respects conflicting. When the conflicts are resolved according to familiar rules we think the facts shown are as follows: In its natural and ordinary condition the lake was from three to six feet deep. When meandered in 1892 and when first known by some of the witnesses it was an open body of clear water. Mud river traversed it in such way that it might well be characterized as an enlarged section of that stream. Early visitors and settlers in that vicinity used the river and lake as a route of travel, employing the small boats of the period for the purpose. The country about had been part of the bed of the glacial Lake Agassiz and was still swampy, so that waterways were the only dependable routes for trade and travel. Mud river after passing through the lake connected at Thief river with a navigable route extending westward to the Red River of the North and thence northward into the British possessions. Merchants in the settlements at Liner and Grygla, which were several miles up Mud river from the lake, used the river and lake in sending for and bringing in their supplies. True, the navigation was limited, but this was because trade and travel in that vicinity were limited. In seasons of great drought there was difficulty in getting boats up the river and through the lake; but this was exceptional, the usual conditions being as just stated. Sand bars in some parts of the lake prevented boats from moving readily all over it, but the bars could be avoided by keeping the boats in the deeper parts or channels. Some years after the lake was meandered, vegetation such as grows in water got a footing in the lake, and gradually came to impede the movement of boats at the end of each growing season, but offered little interference at other times. Gasoline motor boats were used in surveying and marking the line of the intended ditch through the lake and the ditch was excavated with floating dredges.
15
16
Our conclusion is that the evidence requires a finding that the lake was navigable within the approved rule before stated. From this it follows that no prejudice resulted from the recognition below of the local rule respecting navigability.
16
17
We come then to the question whether the lands under the lake were disposed of by the United States before Minnesota became a state. An affirmative disposal is not asserted, but only that the lake, and therefore the lands under it; was within the limits of the Red Lake Reservation when the state was admitted. The existence of the reservation is conceded, but that it operated as a disposal of lands underlying navigable waters within its limits is disputed. We are of opinion that the reservation was not intended to effect such a disposal and that there was none. If the reservation operated as a disposal of the lands under a part of the navigable waters within its limits it equally worked a disposal of the lands under all. Besides Mud Lake, the reservation limits included Red Lake, having an area of square miles, the greater part of the Lake of the Woods, having approximately the same area, and several navigable streams. The reservation came into being through a succession of treaties with the Chippewas whereby they ceded to the United States their aboriginal right of occupancy to the surrounding lands. The last treaties preceding the admission of the state were concluded September and February There was no formal setting apart of what was not ceded,1 nor any affirmative declaration of the rights of the Indians therein, nor any attempted exclusion of others from the use of navigable waters. The effect of what was done was to reserve in a general way for the continued occupation of the Indians what remained of their aboriginal territory, and thus it came to be known and recognized as a reservation. Minnesota v. Hitchcock, L. Ed. There was nothing in this which even approaches a grant of rights in lands underlying navigable waters; nor anything evincing a purpose to depart from the established policy, before stated, of treating such lands as held for the benefit of the future state. Without doubt the Indians were to have access to the navigable waters and to be entitled to use them in accustomed ways; but these were common rights vouchsafed to all, whether white or Indian, by the early legislation reviewed in Railroad Co. v. Schurmeier, and Economy Light & Power Co. v. United States, supra, pp. , and emphasized in the Enabling Act under which Minnesota was admitted as a state (chapter , which declared that the rivers and waters bounding the state 'and the navigable waters leading into the same, shall be common highways, and forever free, as well to the inhabitants of said state as to all other citizens of the United States.' Section 2.
17
18
We conclude that the state on its admission into the Union became the owner of the bed of the lake. It is conceded that, if the bed thus passed to the state, the defendants have succeeded to the state's right therein, and the decisions and statutes of the state brought to our attention show that the concession is rightly made.
18
19
Decree affirmed.

Other reservations for particular bands were specially set apart, but those reservations and bands are not to be confused with the Red Lake Reservation and the bands occupying it. See Treaty concluded October .

MILLERS' INDEMNITY UNDERWRITERS
v.
BRAUD et al.
Argued Jan. 13, 1926.
1
The court below affirmed a judgment of the Orange county district court in favor of defendant in error for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Law of Texas (Gen. Laws Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. Supp. , on account of the death of her brother, O. O Boudreaux. April 17, 1920, while employed as a diver by the National Shipbuilding Company, he submerged himself from a floating barge anchored in the navigable Sabine river 35 feet from the bank, for the purpose of sawing off the timbers of an abandoned set of ways, once used for launching ships, which had become an obstruction to navigation. While thus submerged, the air supply failed, and he died of suffocation.
1
2
The employing company carried a policy of insurance with plaintiff in error conditioned to pay the compensation prescribed by the statute and accordingly was 'regarded as a subscriber' to the Texas Employers' Insurance Association therein provided for. Par. 1, § 3 of the statutes declares:
2
3
'The employees of a subscriber shall have no right of action against their employer for damages for personal injuries, and the representatives and beneficiaries of deceased employees shall have no right of action against such subscribing employer for damages for injuries resulting in death, but such employees and their representatives and beneficiaries shall look for compensation solely to the association, as the same is hereinafter provided for. * * *'
3
4
It also prescribes a schedule of weekly payments for injured employees or their beneficiaries, and provides for a board to pass upon claims and an ultimate right to proceed in court. Subscribers' employees do not contribute to the necessary costs of such protection. They are presumed to accept the plan and to waive all right to recover damages for injuries at common law or under any statute unless they give definite written notice to the contrary. No such notice was given by the deceased.
4
5
Plaintiff in error insists that the claim arose out of a maritime tort, that the rights and obligations of the parties were fixed by the maritime law, and that the state had no power to change these by statute or otherwise.
5
6
This subject was much considered in Grant Smith-Porter Co. v. Rohde, L. Ed. here on certificate, which arose out of injuries suffered by a carpenter while at work upon an uncompleted vessel lying in navigable waters within the state of Oregon. The words of the local statute applied to the employment and prescribed an exclusive remedy. We said the cause was controlled by the principle that, as to certain local matters regulation of which would work no material prejudice to the general maritime law, the rules of the latter may be modified or supplemented by state statutes. And we held that under the circumstances disclosed—
6
7
'regulation of the rights, obligations and consequent liabilities of the parties, as between themselves, by a local rule would not necessarily work material prejudice to any characteristic feature of the general maritime law, or interfere with the proper harmony or uniformity of that law in its international or interstate relations.'
7
8
Stressing the point that the parties were clearly and consciously within the terms of the statute and did not in fact suppose they were contracting with reference to the general system of maritime law, we alluded to the circumstance, not otherwise of special importance, that each of them had contributed to the industrial accident fund.
8
9
And answering the certified questions we affirmed that:
9
10
'The general admiralty jurisdiction extends to a proceeding to recover damages resulting from a tort committed on a vessel in process of construction when lying on navigable waters within a state.'
10
11
'In the circumstances stated the exclusive features of the Oregon Workmen's Compensation Act (Or. L. § et seq.) would apply and abrogate the right to recover damages in an admiralty court which otherwise would exist.'
11
12
In the cause now under consideration the record discloses facts sufficient to show a maritime tort to which the general admiralty jurisdiction would extend save for the provisions of the state Compensation Act; but the matter is of mere local concern and its regulation by the state will work no material prejudice to any characteristic feature of the general maritime law. The act prescribes the only remedy; its exclusive features abrogate the right to resort to the admiralty court which otherwise would exist.
12
13
We had occasion to consider matters which were not of mere local concern because of their special relation to commerce and navigation, and held them beyond the regulatory power of the state, in Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Kierejewski, L. Ed. Washington v. Dawson & Co., L. Ed. Gonsalves v. Morse Dry Dock Co., L. Ed. and Robins Dry Dock Co. v. Dahl, L. Ed.

RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL TRUST CO.
v.
DOUGHTON, Commissioner of Revenue of North Carolina.
Argued Jan. 11, 1926.
1
This is a writ of error to the Supreme Court of North Carolina in a consolidation of two causes, the first being an appeal to a superior court of the state by the plaintiff in error, the Rhode Island Hospital Trust Company, executor of George Briggs, from an inheritance tax assessment on the decedent's estate made by the commissioner of revenue of North Carolina, and the second being an action at law by the executor to recover the taxes paid by it on the assessment under protest. The superior court held that the inheritance taxes imposed by the commissioner of revenue of the state were lawful and that the executor was not entitled to recover them back as illegally collected. The Supreme Court of North Carolina affirmed this judgment. 
1
2
The assignment of error of the executor is based on the invalidity under the Fourteenth Amendment of that part of the Revenue Act of of North Carolina (Public Laws, c. 90, § 6, subsec. 7), which provides:
2
3
'Sec. 6. From and after the passage of this act all real and personal property of whatever kind and nature which shall pass by will or by the intestate laws of this state from any person who may die seized or possessed of the same while a resident of this state, whether the person or persons dying seized thereof be domiciled within or out of the state (or if the decedent was not a resident of this state at the time of his death, such property or any part thereof within this state), or any interest therein or income therefrom which shall be transferred by deed, grant, sale, or gift, made in contemplation of the death of the grantor, bargainor, donor, or assignor, or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after such death, to any person or persons or to bodies corporate or politic, in trust or otherwise, or by reason whereof any person or body corporate or politic shall become beneficially entitled in possession or expectancy to any property or the income thereof, shall be and hereby is made subject to a tax for the benefit of the state. * * *

'Seventh. The words 'such property or any part thereof or interest therein within this state' shall include in its meaning bonds and shares of stock in any incorporated company, incorporated in any other state or country, when such incorporated company is the owner of property in this state, and if 50 per cent. or more of its property is located in this state, and when bonds or shares of stock in any such company not incorporated in this state, and owning property in this state, are transferred by inheritance, the valuation upon which the tax shall be computed shall be the proportion of the total value of such bonds or shares which the property owned by such company in this state bears to the total property owned by such company, and the exemptions allowed shall be the proportion of exemptions allowed by this act, as related to the total value of the property of the decedent.'
4
5
'Any incorporated company not incorporated in this state and owning property in this state which shall transfer on its books the bonds or shares of stock of any decedent holder of shares of stock in such company exceeding in par value $ before the inheritance tax, if any, has been paid, shall become liable for the payment of the said tax, and any property held by such company in this state shall be subject to execution to satisfy same. A receipt or waiver signed by the state tax commission of North Carolina shall be full protection for any such company in the transfer of any such stock or bonds.' George Briggs was a resident of the state of Rhode Island, and domiciled therein at the time of his death. He never resided in North Carolina. He died testate October 29, 1919, leaving a large estate. The plaintiff, Rhode Island Hospital Trust Company, was appointed executor of Briggs' will, and qualified as such before the municipal court of the city of Providence, R. I. Among other personal property passing to the executor under the will were shares of stock in the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which with declared dividends unpaid were valued at $ The R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, hereinafter for brevity called the Tobacco Company, is a corporation created under the laws of the state of New Jersey. Section of the Consolidated Statutes of North Carolina provides that every foreign corporation, before being permitted to do business in North Carolina, shall file in the office of the secretary of state a copy of its charter, a statement of the amount of its capital stock, the amount actually issued, the principal office in North Carolina, the name of the agent in charge of the office, the character of the business which it transacts, and the name and post office addresses of its officers and directors. It is required to pay, for the use of the state, 29 cents for every $of its authorized capital stock, but in no case less than $25, nor more than $ It may withdraw from the state upon paying a fee of $5, and filing in the office of the secretary of state a statement of its wish to do so. In August, the Tobacco Company filed its application under the statute and complied with the requirements, and a certificate granting authority to it to do business in the state was issued. Two-thirds in value of its entire property is in North Carolina. Since it has regularly paid the license and franchise tax required, and is still doing business in the state.

Briggs' certificates of stock in the Tobacco Company, passing under his will to his executor, were, none of them, in the state of North Carolina at the time of his death, and never had been while they were owned by him. The commissioner of revenue of the state assessed an inheritance tax upon $per cent. of the total value of Briggs' stock, amounting to $ The plaintiff, as executor, applied to the office of the company in New Jersey to have this stock transferred to it as executor, in compliance with the will of Briggs. The company refused to do so, on the ground that under the law of North Carolina, already set forth, it would, by such transfer before the executor paid the transfer tax, subject itself to a penalty which could be exacted out of its property in that state. Thereupon the executor paid the tax under protest, and brought suit to recover it back.

The question here presented is whether North Carolina can validly impose a transfer or inheritance tax upon shares of stock owned by a nonresident in a business corporation of New Jersey, because the corporation does business and has two-thirds of its property within the limits of North Carolina. We think that the law of North Carolina, by which this is attempted, is invalid. It goes without saying that a state may not tax property which is not within its territorial jurisdiction. State Tax on Foreign Held Bonds, Louisville Ferry Co. v. Kentucky, Delaware Railroad v. Pennsylvania, Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, L. Ed. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. New York, L. Ed. 853; United States v. Bennett, L. Ed. 612; International Paper Co. v. Massachusetts, L. Ed. Frick v. Pennsylvania, L. Ed. 1058.

The tax here is not upon property, but upon the right of succession to property; but the principle that the subject to be taxed must be within the jurisdiction of the state applies as well in the case of a transfer tax as in that of a property tax. A state has no power to tax the devolution of the property of a nonresident, unless it has jurisdiction of the property devolved or transferred. In the matter of intangibles, like choses in action, shares of stock, and bonds, the situs of which is with the owner, a transfer tax, of course, may be properly levied by the state in which he resides. So, too, it is well established that the state in which a corporation is organized may provide, in creating it, for the taxation in that state of all its shares, whether owned by residents or nonresidents. Hawley v. Malden, Ann. Cas. Hannis Distilling Co. v. Baltimore, Corry v. Baltimore, Tappan v. Bank, L. Ed. 189.

In this case the jurisdiction of North Carolina rests on the claim that because the New Jersey corporation has two-thirds of its property in North Carolina, the state may treat shares of its stock as having a situs in North Carolina to the extent of the ratio in value of its property in North Carolina to all of its property. This is on the theory that the stockholder is the owner of the property of the corporation, and the state which has jurisdiction of any of the corporate property has pro tanto jurisdiction of his shares of stock. We cannot concur in this view. The owner of the shares of stock in a company is not the owner of the corporation's property. He has a right to his share in the earnings of the corporation, as they may be declared in dividends, arising from the use of all its property. In the dissolution of the corporation he may take his proportionate share in what is left, after all the debts of the corporation have been paid and the assets are divided in accordance with the law of its creation. But he does not own the corporate property.
9
10
In Van Allen v. Assessors, the question was whether shares of stock in a national bank could be subjected to state taxation if part or all of the capital of the bank was invested in securities of the national government declared by the statute authorizing them to be exempt from taxation by state authority. It was held that they could be so taxed. Mr. Justice Nelson, speaking for this court, said, at page :
10
11
'But, in addition to this view, the tax on the shares is not a tax on the capital of the bank. The corporation is the legal owner of all the property of the bank, real and personal; and within the powers conferred upon it by the charter, and for the purposes for which it was created, can deal with the corporate property as absolutely as a private individual can deal with his own. This is familiar law, and will be found in every work that may be opened on the subject of corporations. * * *
11
12
'The interest of the shareholder entitles him to participate in the net profits earned by the bank in the employment of its capital, during the existence of its charter, in proportion to the number of his shares; and, upon its dissolution or termination, to his proportion of the property that may remain of the corporation after the payment of its debts. This a distinct independent interest or property, held by the shareholder like any other property that may belong to him.'
12
13
The same principle is declared in Jellenik v. Huron Copper Co., in which it was held that shares of stock in a corporation had a situs in the state creating the corporation so that they were there subject to mesne process. It is approved in Farrington v. Tennessee, in Hawley v. Malden, supra, at page , in Eisner v. Macomber, L. Ed. and in Des Moines Nat. Bank v. Fairweather, Mayor. 
13
14
In North Carolina and in some other states, the state Constitution requires all property, real and personal, to be taxed equally. Laws have been passed exempting shares of stock in North Carolina corporations from taxation, on the ground that the property of the corporation is taxed which is held to be equivalent to taxing the shares. Person v. Watts, Jones v. Davis, But such cases grow out of state constitutional difficulties and are hardly applicable to questions of state jurisdiction of shares of foreign corporation stock. The cases of Bronson's Estate, Am. St. Rep. and In re Culver's Estate, L. R. A. (N. S.) said to hold that a stockholder owns the property of the corporation, are really authorities to the point that shares of stock in a corporation of a state have their situs for purposes of taxation in that state, as well as in the residence of the owner of the shares. But whatever the view of the other courts, that of this court is clear; the stockholder does not own the corporate property. Jurisdiction for tax purposes over his shares cannot, therefore, be made to rest on the situs of part of the corporate property within the taxing state. North Carolina cannot control the devolution of New Jersey shares. That is determined by the laws of Rhode Island where the decedent owner lived or by those of New Jersey, because the shares have a situs in the state of incorporation. There is nothing in the statutory conditions on which the Tobacco Company began or continued business in North Carolina which suggests that its shareholders subjected their stock to the taxing jurisdiction of that state by the company's doing business there.
14
15
Our conclusion is in accord with the great majority of cases in the state courts where this exact question has arisen. Welch v. Burrill, People v. Dennett, State v. Dunlap, Idaho, State v. Walker, In re Harkness' Estate, Tyler v. Dane County, contains a full and satisfactory discussion of the subject in a Wisconsin case which has been followed by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in Estate of Shepard, See article by Professor Beale, 38 Harvard Law Review. 
15
16
In an addendum to its opinion in this case, the Supreme Court of North Carolina suggests that the jurisdiction of the state to tax the shares of the New Jersey corporation may be based on the view that the corporation has been domesticated in North Carolina. So far as the statutes of the state show, it has been authorized to do and does business in the state and owns property therein and pays a fee for the permission to do so. It has not been re-incorporated in the state. It is still a foreign corporation and the rights of its stockholders are to be determined accordingly.
16
17
We conclude that the statute of North Carolina, above set out, in so far as it attempts to subject the shares of stock in the New Jersey corporation, held by a resident of Rhode Island, to a transfer tax deprives the executor of Briggs of his property without due process of law and is invalid.

INDEPENDENT WIRELESS TELEGRAPH CO.
v.
RADIO CORPORATION OF AMERICA.
Decided March 1, 1926.
1
This is a petition for rehearing of a case in which the opinion was handed down January 11th last. The case was a bill in equity in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, filed by the Radio Corporation to enjoin the Independent Wireless Company from infringing the rights of the Radio Company, which were averred in its bill to be those of an exclusive sublicensee of the patentee, the De Forest Radio Telegraph & Telephone Company, in respect of the use of certain radio apparatus for commercial communication between ships and shore for pay. The Radio Company made the De Forest Company a co-complainant in the bill, reciting that it had asked the De Forest Company to become a co-complainant, and that it had refused; that the De Forest Company was a resident of Delaware, was beyond the jurisdiction of the District Court for the Southern District of New York, and could not be served with process; and that under such circumstances it had the right to use the name of the De Forest Company as co-complainant without its consent. A motion to dismiss the bill was granted by the District Court for lack of the presence of the patentee as a party, and an appeal was taken from the decree of dismissal to the Circuit Court of Appeals. The latter court reversed the decree of dismissal and remanded the case for further proceedings. Thereupon an application was made to this court for certiorari, and the certiorari was issued. In the opinion already rendered, January 11th last, this court held that the Radio Corporation properly made the De Forest Company a co-complainant with it in the bill without its consent, and therefore that the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals in reversing the decree of the District Court dismissing the bill was right.
1
2
The petition for rehearing on behalf of the Independent Wireless Company now filed, raises the question whether the Radio Corporation is an exclusive sublicensee of the patentee, the De Forest Company, under the contracts from which the Radio Company derives its rights, and which are exhibits to the bill. It is the first time that this question has been made in this court. The bill which was dismissed makes the specific averment that the Radio Corporation did have the rights of an exclusive licensee. Both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals found from the contracts as exhibited that the Radio Company had the exclusive rights as sublicensee which it claimed. The briefs for the Independent Wireless Company did not raise any question on this point in this court, nor was it mentioned in that company's petition for certiorari. Its whole argument therein was devoted to the issue whether, assuming that the Radio Company was an exclusive licensee, it could make the patentee company, the De Forest Company a co-complainant. As the District Judge remarked in his opinion, the contracts out of which the Radio Company's alleged exclusive license arises are complicated, and this court, in view of the decision of both the lower courts, holding such exclusive rights in the Radio Company as a licensee to exist, decided the case on the basis of those rights. In view of the course of the Independent Wireless Company in not making this point in its petition for certiorari, briefs or argument, we do not propose to examine this question now raised for the first time. Our writ of certiorari was granted solely because of the importance the question of patent practice decided in our opinion already announced. However, as the case must now be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings, we have no wish by action of ours to preclude the defendant below from making the point unless it is prevented by his course in the courts below.
2
3
We therefore direct the mandate to include a provision that the further proceedings to be taken shall be without prejudice, by reason of anything in the opinion or decree of this court, to the right of the Independent Wireless Company to raise the issue, by answer or otherwise whether the Radio Corporation has the rights as an exclusive sublicensee, which it avers in its bill. With this reservation, the petition for rehearing is denied.

OREGON-WASHINGTON R. & NAV. CO.
v.
STATE OF WASHINGTON.
Argued Jan. 28, 1926.
1
This was a bill of complaint filed by the state of Washington in the superior court of Thurston county of that state against the defendant, the Oregon-Washington Railway & Navigation Company, an interstate common carrier in the states of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. The bill averred that there existed in the areas of the states of Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Oregon, and Nevada, an injurious insect popularly called the alfalfa weevil, and scientifically known as the phytonomus posticus, which fed upon the leaves and foliage of the alfalfa plant, to the great damage of the crop; that the insect multiplied rapidly, and was propagated by means of eggs deposited by the female insect upon the leaves and stalks of the plant; that, when the hay was cured, the eggs clung to and remained dormant upon the hay, and even in the meal made from it; that the eggs and live weevils were likely to be carried to points where hay was transported, infecting the growing crop there; that when the hay was carried in common box cars the eggs and live weevils were likely to be shaken out and distributed along the route and communicated to the agricultural lands adjacent to the route; that a proper inspection to ascertain the presence of the eggs or weevils would require the tearing open of every bale of hay and sack of meal, involving a prohibitive cost of inspection, and that the only practical method of preventing the spread into uninfested districts was to prohibit the transportation of hay or meal from the district in which the weevil existed; that the pest is new to, and not generally distributed within, the state of Washington; that there is no known method of ridding a district infested of the pest; that subsequent to June 8, and prior to September 17, information was received by the Washington director of agriculture that there was a probability of the introduction of the weevil into the state across its boundaries; that he thereupon investigated thoroughly the insect and the areas where such pests existed, and ascertained it to be in the whole of the state of Utah, all portions of the state of Idaho Lying south of Idaho county, the counties of Uinta and Lincoln in the state of Wyoming, the county of Delta in the state of Colorado, the counties of Malheur and Baker in the state of Oregon, and the county of Washoe in the state of Nevada; that he, with the approval of the Governor of the state, thereupon, on or about September 17, made and promulgated a quarantine regulation and order, under the terms of which he declared a quarantine against all of the above-described areas, and forbade the importation into Washington of alfalfa hay and alfalfa meal, except in sealed containers, and fixed the boundaries of the quarantine. The bill further averred that the defendant, knowing of the proclamation, and in violation thereof, had caused to be shipped into Washington, in common box cars, and not in sealed containers, approximately cars of alfalfa hay, consigned from various points in the state of Idaho lying south of Idaho county, and through the state of Oregon and into the state of Washington, in direct violation of the quarantine order, and that, unless enjoined, the defendant would continue to make these shipments from such quarantined area in the state of Idaho into and through the state of Washington; that large quantities of alfalfa were grown in the eastern and central portions of Washington, and adjacent to the railroad lines of the defendant and other railroads over which such shipments of alfalfa hay were shipped and were likely to be shipped in the future, unless an injunction was granted, to the great and irreparable damage of the citizens of Washington growing alfalfa therein. A temporary injunction was issued, and then a demurrer was filed by the defendants. The demurrer was overruled. An answer was filed, and in each of the pleadings was set out the claim by the defendant that the action and proclamation of the director of agriculture and the Governor, and chapter of the Laws of Washington of under which they acted, were in contravention of the interstate commerce clause of the federal Constitution, and in conflict with an act of Congress.
1
2
At the hearing there was evidence on behalf of the state that the Oregon-Washington and Northern Pacific Railroads ran through the parts of the state where the alfalfa was raised; that the weevil had first appeared in Utah in 1904 in Salt Lake City, and that it had spread about 10 miles a year; that it came from Russia and Southern Europe; that it would be impossible to adopt any method of inspection of alfalfa hay to keep out the weevil, not prohibitory in cost; that in Europe the weevil is not a serious pest, because its natural enemies exist there, and they keep it down; that the United States government had attempted to introduce parasites, but that it takes a long time to secure a natural check from such a method; that methods by using poison sprays, by burning, and in other ways had been used to attack the pest, but that no one method has been entirely successful; that there is no practical way of eliminating the beetles completely, if the field once becomes infected, and the continuance of the pest will be indefinite; that the great danger of spreading the infection is through the transfer of hay from one section to another. In behalf of the defendant it was testified that the prevalent opinion in regard to the spread of the alfalfa weevil and the damage it was doing was vestly exaggerated; that the spread of the weevil from hay shipped in the cars through the state of Washington was decidedly improbable. The superior court made the temporary injunction permanent and the Supreme Court of Washington affirmed the decree. This is a writ of error under section of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. § to that decree.
2
3
By chapter of the Washington Session Laws of the director is given the power and duty, with the approval of the Governor, to establish and maintain quarantine needed to keep out of the state contagion or infestation by disease of trees and plants and injurious insects or other pests, to institute an inspection to prevent any infected articles from coming in, except upon a certificate of investigation by such director, or in his name by an inspector. Upon information received by the director of the existence of any infectious plant, disease, insect or weed pest, new to or not generally distributed within the state, dangerous to the plant industry of the state, he is required to proceed to investigate the same, and then enforce necessary quarantine. There is a provision for punishment of a fine of not less than $ or more than $ or by both such fine and imprisonment, for violation of the act.
3
4
In the absence of any action taken by Congress on the subject-matter, it is well settled that a state, in the exercise of its police power, may establish quarantines against human beings, or animals, or plants, the coming in of which may expose the inhabitants, or the stock, or the trees, plants, or growing crops, to disease, injury, or destruction thereby, and this in spite of the fact that such quarantines necessarily affect interstate commerce.
4
5
Chief Justice Marshall, in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat, 1, 6 L. Ed. 23, speaking of inspection laws, says at page :
5
6
'They form a portion of that immense mass of legislation, which embraces everything within the territory of a state, not surrendered to the general government, all which can be most advantageously exercised by the states themselves. Inspection laws, quarantine laws, health laws of every description, as well as laws for regulating the internal commerce of a state, and those which respect turnpike roads, ferries, etc., are component parts of this mass.'
6
7
'The acts of Congress, passed in * * * empowering and directing the officers of the general government to conform to and assist in the execution of the quarantine and health laws of a state, proceed, it is said, upon the idea that these laws are constitutional. It is undoubtedly true, that they do proceed upon that idea; and the constitutionality of such laws has never, so far as we are informed, been denied. But they do not imply an acknowledgment that a state may rightfully regulate commerce with foreign nations, or among the states; for they do not imply that such laws are an exercise of that power, or enacted with a view to it. On the contrary, they are treated as quarantine and health laws, are so denominated in the acts of Congress, and are considered as flowing from the acknowledged power of a state to provide for the health of its citizens. But as it was apparent that some of the provisions made for this purpose, and in virtue of this power, might interfere with and be affected by the laws of the United States, made for the regulation of commerce, Congress, in that spirit of harmony and conciliation which ought always to characterize the conduct of governments standing in the relation which that of the Union and those of the states bear to each other, has directed its officers to aid in the execution of these laws, and has, in some measure, adapted its own legislation to this object, by making provisions in aid of those of the states. But in making these provisions the opinion is unequivocally manifested that Congress may control the state laws, so far as it may be necessary to control them, for the regulation of commerce.'
7
8
This court, in the Minnesota Rate Cases, L. R. A. (N. S.) , 18), said:
8
9
'Quarantine regulations are essential measures of protection which the states are free to adopt when they do not come into conflict with federal action. In view of the need of conforming such measures to local conditions, Congress from the beginning has been content to leave the matter for the most part, notwithstanding its vast importance, to the states and has repeatedly acquiesced in the enforcement of state laws. * * * Such laws undoubtedly operate upon interstate and foreign commerce. They could not be effective otherwise. They cannot, of course, be made the cover for discriminations and arbitrary enactments having no reasonable relation to health (Hannibal & St. J. Railroad Co. v. Husen, ); but the power of the state to take steps to prevent the introduction or spread of disease, although interstate and foreign commerce are involved (subject to the paramount authority of Congress if it decides to assume control), is beyond question (Morgan's, etc., S. S. Co. v. Louisiana; Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Haber, L. Ed. ; Louisiana v. Texas, L. Ed. ; Rasmussen v. Idaho, L. Ed. ; Compagnie Francaise, &c. v. Board of Health, L. Ed. ; Reid v. Colorado; Asbell v. Kansas, L. Ed. ).'
9
10
Counsel for the company argues that the case of Railroad Co. v. Husen, is an authority to show that this law as carried out by the proclamation goes too far, in that it forbids importations from certain parts of Idaho, of Utah, of Nevada, of alfalfa hay, without qualification and without any limit of time. The Husen Case is to be distinguished from the other cases cited, in that the Missouri statute there held invalid was found by the court not to be a quarantine provision at all. It forbade the importation into Missouri for eight months of the year of any Texas, Mexican, or Indian cattle, without regard to whether the cattle were diseased or not, and without regard to the question whether they came from a part of the country where they had been exposed to contagion. We think that here the investigation required by the Washington law and the investigation actually made into the existence of this pest and its geographical location makes the law a real quarantine law and not a mere inhibition against importation of alfalfa from a large part of the country without regard to the conditions which might make its importation dangerous.
10
11
The second objection to the validity of this Washington law and the action of the state officers, however, is more formidable. Under the language used in Gibbons v. Ogden, supra, and the Minnesota Rate Cases, supra, the exercise of the police power of quarantine, in spite of its interfering with interstate commerce, is permissible under the interstate commerce clause of the federal Constitution 'subject to the paramount authority of Congress, if it decides to assume control.'
11
12
By the Act of Congress of August as amended by the Act of March (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. , it is made unlawful to import or offer for entry into the United States any nursery stock unless permit had been issued by the Secretary of Agriculture under regulations prescribed by him.
12
13
Section 2 of the act of makes it the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to notify the Secretary of Agriculture of the arrival of any nursery stock, and forbids the shipment from one state or territory or district of the United States into another of any nursery stock imported into the United States without notifying the Secretary of Agriculture, or, at his direction, the proper state, territorial, or district official to which the nursery stock was destined. Whenever the Secretary of Agriculture shall determine that such nursery stock may result in the entry of plant diseases or insect pests, he shall promulgate his determination of this, but shall give due notice and a public hearing, at which any interested party might appear before the promulgation.
13
14
Section provides that whenever, in order to prevent the introduction into the United States of any tree, plant, or fruit disease, or any injurious insect, not theretofore widely prevalent or distributed within and through the United States, the Secretary shall determine that it was necessary to forbid the importation into the United States, he shall promulgate such determination, and such importations are thereafter prohibited.
14
15
Section 8 of the act was amended by the Agricultural Appropriation Act of March 4, 1917, and reads as follows:
15
16
'Sec. 8. That the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized and directed to quarantine any state, territory, or District of the United States, or any portion thereof, when he shall determine that such quarantine is necessary to prevent the spread of a dangerous plant disease or insect infestation, new to or not theretofore widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United States; and the Secretary of Agriculture is directed to give notice of the establishment of such quarantine to common carriers doing business in or through such quarantined area, and shall publish in such newspapers in the quarantined area as he shall select notice of the establishment of quarantine. That no person shall ship or offer for shipment to any common carrier, nor shall any common carrier receive for transportation or transport, nor shall any person carry or transport from any quarantined state or territory or District of the United States, or from any quarantined portion thereof, into or through any other state or territory or District, any class of nursery stock or any other class of plants, fruits, vegetables, roots, bulbs, seeds, or other plant products, or any class of stone or quarry products, or any other article of any character whatsoever, capable of carrying any dangerous plant disease or insect infestation, specified in the notice of quarantine except as hereinafter provided. That it shall be unlawful to move, or allow to be moved, any class of nursery stock or any other class of plants, fruits, vegetables, roots, bulbs, seeds, or other plant products, or any class of stone or quarry products or any other article of any character whatsoever, capable of carrying any dangerous plant disease or insect infestation, specified in the notice of quarantine hereinbefore provided, and regardless of the use for which the same is intended, from any quarantined state or territory or District of the United States or quarantined portion thereof, into or through any other state or territory or District, in manner or method or under conditions other than those prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture. That it shall be the duty of the Secretary of Agriculture, when the public interests will permit, to make and promulgate rules and regulations which shall permit and govern the inspection, disinfection, certification, and method and manner of delivery and shipment of the class of nursery stock or of any other class of plants, fruits, vegetables, roots, bulbs, seeds, or other plant products, or any class of stone or quarry products, or any other article of any character whatsoever, capable of carrying any dangerous plant disease or insect infestation, specified in the notice of quarantine hereinbefore provided, and regardless of the use for which the same is intended, from a quarantined state or territory or District of the United States, or quarantined portion thereof, into or through any other state or territory or District; and the Secretary of Agriculture shall give notice of such rules and regulations as hereinbefore provided in this section for the notice of the establishment of quarantine: Provided, that before the Secretary of Agriculture shall promulgate his determination that it is necessary to quarantine any state, territory, or District of the United States, or portion thereof, under the authority given in this section, he shall, after due notice to interested parties, give a public hearing under such rules and regulations as he shall prescribe, at which hearing any interested party may appear and be heard, either in person or by attorney.'
16
17
Section 10 of the act (Comp. St. § provides that any person who shall violate any provisions of the act, or who shall forge, counterfeit, or destroy any certificate provided for in the act or in the regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine not exceeding $ or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court. It is made the duty of the United States attorneys diligently to prosecute any violations of this act which are brought to their attention by the Secretary of Agriculture, or which come to their notice by other means, and that, for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall appoint from existing bureaus in his office a commission of five members employed therein.
17
18
It is impossible to read this statute and consider its scope without attributing to Congress the intention to take over to the Agricultural Department of the federal government the care of the horticulture and agriculture of the states, so far as these may be affected injuriously by the transportation in foreign and interstate commerce of anything which by reason of its character can convey disease to and injure trees, plants, or crops. All the sections look to a complete provision for quarantine against importation into the country and quarantine as between the states under the direction and supervision of the Secretary of Agriculture.
18
19
The courts of Washington and the counsel for the state rely on the decision of this court in Reid v. Colorado, L. Ed. 108, as an authority to sustain the validity of the Washington law before us.
19
20
The Reid Case involved the constitutionality of a conviction of Reid for violation of an act of Colorado to prevent the introduction of infectious or contagious diseases among the cattle and horses of that state. The law made it unlawful for any person, association, or corporation to bring or drive any cattle or horses, suffering from such disease, or which had within 90 days prior thereto been herded or brought into contact with any other cattle or horses suffering from such disease, into the state, unless a certificate or bill of health could be produced from the state veterinary sanitary board that the cattle and horses were free from all infectious or contagious diseases. It was urged that it was inconsistent with the federal Animal Industry Act (23 Stat. ). This directed a study of contagious and communicable diseases of animals and the best method of treating them by the federal Commissioner of Agriculture, to be certified to the executive authority of each state and the co-operation of such authority was invited. If the authorities of the state adopted the plans and methods advised by the department, or if such authorities adopted measures of their own which the department approved, then the money appropriated by Congress was to be used in conducting investigations, and in aiding such disinfection and quarantine measures as might be necessary to prevent the spread of the diseases in question from one state or territory into another. This court held that Congress did not intend by the act to override the power of the states to care for the safety of the property of their people, because it did not undertake to invest any officer or agent of the department with authority to go into a state and without its assent take charge of the work of suppressing or extirpating contagious, infectious, or communicable diseases there prevailing, or to inspect cattle or give a certificate of freedom from disease for cattle of superior authority to state certificates.
20
21
It is evident that the federal statute under consideration in the Reid Case was an effort to induce the states to co-operate with the general government in measures to suppress the spread of disease, without at all interfering with the action of the state in quarantining or taking any other measures to extirpate it or prevent its spread. Indeed, the Commissioner of Agriculture in that case was to aid the state authorities in their quarantine and other measures from federal appropriation. The act we are considering is very different. It makes no reference whatever to co-operation with state authorities. It proposes the independent exercise of federal authority with reference to quarantine in interstate commerce. It covers the whole field so far as the spread of the plant disease by interstate transportation can be affected and restrained. With such authority vested in the Secretary of Agriculture, and with such duty imposed upon him, the state laws of quarantine that affect interstate commerce and thus federal law, cannot stand together. The relief sought to protect the different states, in so far as it depends on the regulation of interstate commerce, must be obtained through application to the Secretary of Agriculture.
21
22
In the relation of the states to the regulation of interstate commerce by Congress there are two fields. There is one in which the state cannot interfere at all, even in the silence of Congress. In the other, and this is the one in which the legitimate exercise of the state's police power brings it into contact with interstate commerce, so as to affect that commerce, the state may exercise its police power until Congress has by affirmative legislation occupied the field by regulating interstate commerce and so necessarily has excluded state action.
22
23
Cases of the latter type are the Southern Railway Co. v. Reid, Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Washington, L. Ed. 237; C. R. I. & P. Ry. Co. v. Elevator Co., L. Ed. Erie Railroad Co. v. New York, L. Ed. Ann. Cas. and Missouri Pacific Railroad Co. v. Stroud. 
23

Some stress is laid by the counsel of the state on the case of Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Larabee Flour Mills Co., There the question was whether a state court might by mandamus compel a railroad company, under its common-law obligation as a common carrier to afford equal local switching service to its shippers, notwithstanding the fact that the cars in regard to which the service was claimed were two-thirds of them in interstate commerce and one-third in intrastate commerce. The contention was that the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act put such switching wholly in control of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The case was one on the border line, three judges dissenting. The number of cases decided since that case and above cited have made it clear that the rule, as it always had been, was not intended in that case to be departed from. That rule is that there is a field in which the local interests of states touch so closely upon interstate commerce that, in the silence of Congress on the subject, the states may exercise their police powers, and local switchings, as in that case, and quarantine, as in the case before us, are in that field. But, when Congress has acted and occupied the field, as it has here, the power of the states to act is prevented or suspended.
24
25
It follows that, pending the existing legislation of Congress as to quarantine of diseased trees and plants in interstate commerce, the statute of Washington on the subject cannot be given application. It is suggested that the states may act in the absence of any action by the Secretary of Agriculture, that it is left to him to allow the states to quarantine, and that if he does not act there is no invalidity in the state action. Such construction as that cannot be given to the federal statute. The obligation to act without respect to the states is put directly upon the Secretary of Agriculture, whenever quarantine, in his judgment, is necessary. When he does not act, it must be presumed that it is not necessary. With the federal law in force, state action is illegal and unwarranted.

26
The decree of the Supreme Court of Washington is
26
27
Reversed.

28
Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, and Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND dissenting.
28
29
We cannot think Congress intended that the Act of March 4, 1917, without more, should deprive the states of power to protect themselves against threatened disaster like the one disclosed by this record.
29
30
If the Secretary of Agriculture had taken some affirmative action, the problem would be a very different one. Congress could have exerted all the power which this statute delegated to him by positive and direct enactment. If it had said nothing whatever, certainly the state could have resorted to the quarantine; and this same right, we think, should be recognized when its agent has done nothing.
30
31
It is a serious thing to paralyze the efforts of a state to protect her people against impending calamity, and leave them to the slow charity of a far-off and perhaps supine federal bureau. No such purpose should be attributed to Congress, unless indicated beyond reasonable doubt.

SOUTHERN PAC. CO.
v.
UNITED STATES.
270 U.S. 107
CINCINNATI, I. & W. R. CO.
v.
INDIANAPOLIS UNION RY. CO. et al.
Argued Nov. 25, 1925.
1
These are appeals under section of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. § , allowed February 18, 1925, in two cases between the same parties from identical decrees of the District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. By agreement they are to be treated in every respect as one. The certificate of the District Court is that the petition as amended 'does not show the existence of the requisite diversity of citizenship, nor the existence of a federal question, and that this court, not having found the said petition to be ancillary to any prior suit, but having found the said petition to be original, did thereupon dismiss the same upon the sole ground of want of jurisdiction.' The question of jurisdiction is whether a petition by the purchasing company at a railway foreclosure sale, in seeking to reform, because of mistake, its contract of purchase in imposing upon it liability for rentals under a terminal facilities contract, is a suit ancillary to the original foreclosure suit, so that jurisdiction exists in the federal District Court to hear it, without regard to the citizenship of the necessary parties to the petition.
1
2
The two original foreclosure suits were brought, one by the Equitable Trust Company of New York and Elias J. Jacoby as trustees, against the Cincinnati, Indianapolis & Western Railway Company, and the other by the Central Trust Company of New York and Mason, trustees, against the same railway company. There was the necessary diversity of citizenship in each case, and the appellant in this present suit, the Cincinnati Indianapolis & Western Railway Company, is a newly organized company, the assignee of the purchaser at the foreclosure sales of the whole railroad property covered by all the mortgages foreclosed. It became a party to each cause as such assignee, as permitted in the decree of foreclosure in each case, and it will be hereafter called the purchasing company.
2
3
The Indiana, Decatur & Western Railway Company owned the part of the railway from Indianapolis to Springfield, Ill. The Cincinnati, Hamilton & Indianapolis Railway Company owned the part from Indianapolis to the East. In they were merged into a corporation called the Cincinnati, Indianapolis & Western Railway Company, which gave a first refunding mortgage upon the two properties. It was expected that the bonds secured by this mortgage would be used in refunding two underlying mortgages on the eastern part, and a single underlying mortgage on the western part. The refunding was not completed, and the two foreclosure suits, already referred to, were filed at the same time in the same court, so that by an identical decree in each case the purchaser was enabled to acquire title to the consolidated railway free from the liens of the four mortgages. The decree of foreclosure in each case contained a provision giving the purchaser under the foreclosure sale, and his successors or assigns, the right for a period of 30 days after the delivery of the master's deed to elect 'whether or not to assume or adopt any lease or contract made by the defendant consolidated company, or its predecessors in title, and such purchaser, his successors or assigns, shall be held not to have adopted or assumed any such lease or contract in respect of which he or they shall have filed a written election not to assume or adopt the same with the clerk of this court within the said period of 30 days.'
3
4
Within the 30 days the purchasing company filed in the two foreclosure cases what it called an election 'not to assume or adopt the contract dated September 20, 1883, and the amendment of August 20, 1906, under which the tracks of the Union Railway Company are occupied in Indianapolis in so far as such rights are conferred by the signature of the Indianapolis, Decatur & Springfield Railway Company to said contract. This assignee hereby expressly accepts such contract as made with the Cincinnati, Hamilton & Indianapolis Railroad Company, and desires to accept the benefits of the contract with said company, and the right to occupy the tracks of the Union Railway Company and the Indianapolis Belt Railway Company therein conferred.'
4
5
The Indianapolis Union Railway Company is a company engaged in operating a union railway depot and union railway tracks for the use of several railroads entering that city; its properties having been owned by five so-called proprietary companies and conveyed by them to it. It had acquired a perpetual lease of a belt line. September 20, 1883, an agreement was made between the Union Railway Company and five proprietary companies, by which each of the companies in the use of the terminals became liable for a fixed rental which was to be paid by each company, whether the terminal was used or not. Then there were admitted seven non-proprietary companies to the joint use of the Belt Railway and Union Railway Company property under the same agreement as to a fixed rental, in addition to which there was to be a payment in proportion to the use on the basis of wheelage. At this time the Indianapolis, Decatur & Springfield Railway Company owned the part of the railroad here in question west of Indianapolis, and it bound itself for one-thirteenth of the rental, and the Cincinnati, Hamilton & Indianapolis Railroad Company, owning the other part of the railroad here in question east of Indianapolis, became bound for another one-thirteenth of the rental. In the two companies were united under the name of the Cincinnati, Indianapolis & Western Railroad Company, and from that time until the foreclosure, in 1915, the united company paid two-thirteenths of the rentals. When, however, the decrees were made in the foreclosure of the two parts of the railway, the purchasing company, the appellant here, sought to reduce its rental from two-thirteenths to one-thirteenth, by electing to take the contract for rental of its predecessor in title of the eastern part of the united railway, and to refuse to elect to take the contract of rental of its predecessor in title for the western part of the railway, and, having filed such an election, it declined to pay more than one-thirteenth of the rental.
5
6
There then intervened in the original foreclosure suits the Indianapolis Union Railway Company and the then proprietary parties to the terminal agreement by petitions asking that the purchasing company show cause why it sould not be ordered to make payment to the Indianapolis Union Company of the full amount that would have been payable to that company by the Cincinnati, Indianapolis & Western Railway Company, the defendant in the foreclosure in both suits. Jurisdiction was taken of this petition, and the District Court held that the so-called election was unauthorized and improper, and that the purchasing company, for failure to elect to reject the contracts entirely, was responsible for two-thirteenths of the total rentals. This controversy was carried to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which affirmed the District Court. Cincinnati, I. & W. R. Co. v. Indianapolis Union Railroad Co.. 
6
7
The order of the Circuit Court of Appeals was made in the present intervening petition was filed by appellant as purchaser against the Indianapolis Union Railway Company and the proprietary companies, which had been parties to the preceding controversy. In this the petitioner, the present appellant, sought to have the court relieve it from the effect of its so-called ineffective election by which it made itself responsible according to the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals for two-thirteenths, on the ground of its mistake in not electing to reject the whole contract for use of the terminals. On the hearing of the petition to which the Indianapolis Union Railway Company and the other defendants filed answers, the District Court held that the delay of two years between the coming down of the decree from the Circuit Court of Appeals in when the petition was filed, was a delay constituting acquiescence which would prevent the consideration of the petition. The petitioner then filed an amendment to its petition, in which it set out reasons thought by it to justify the delay, including a statement that attempts had been made to secure relief by a personal negotiation with the interested parties to whom it had indicated from the first that it did not intend to acquiesce in an obligation to pay the rentals. The District Court, conceiving that by reason of the delay of two years such relief as the petitioners sought must be obtained by an independent suit, and not by an ancillary proceeding, held that there being no diversity of citizenship or federal question to justify jurisdiction, the petition must be dismissed.
7
8
The sufficiency of the petition in equity is not for us to consider. We have here only the question of jurisdiction. On that issue, we think the District Court was in error. The present proceeding deals with the effect of the decree upon which the petitioner became the owner of the property. The previous litigation between the parties to this petition as to the effect of the attempted election, in which the petitioner was defeated, involved a construction of the decree of sale and the purchaser's action under it in the foreclosure proceedings. That decree provided that 'all questions not hereby disposed of are reserved for future adjudication. Any party to this cause may at any time apply to this court for further relief at the foot of this decree.' It also provided 'that the purchaser had the right to enter appearance in this court and to become a party to this cause,' and it made itself a party under that order. The Circuit Court of Appeals, in its opinion in the case already cited, said:
8
9
'Notwithstanding the property had passed from the possession of the court, appellant (that is, petitioner) as the purchaser would have an undoubted right to apply to the court for relief respecting the controversy over its right of election under the sale.'
9
10
At the instance of the defendants here, the purchaser was held by its so-called election to be bound to the two contracts, and, having been thus defeated, it seeks the equitable intervention of the court, on the ground of mistake, to secure relief from this adjudicated effect of its unsuccessful attempt at election. Assuming that it has a right to seek such a remedy (and we must do so in this hearing), we do not see why it may not obtain that relief in the same forum by ancillary proceeding in the original suit in foreclosure in which it was held to have bound itself by its purchase and ineffective election. It may be that equity will not give it relief from mistake under the circumstances. It may be that it has acquiesced, and may be denied relief on that account. It may be that it has been guilty of laches. But these are questions on the merits. We cannot see that they affect the jurisdiction of the court to consider the issue thus raised.
10
11
The present proceeding is only another phase of the same litigation, carried on as ancillary to the foreclosure suit, in which the purchasing company was found to be bound by its purchase to pay two-thirteenths of the rentals to the Indianapolis Union Railway. The purchaser seeks to recur to the circumstances under which it attempted to accept liability to pay one-thirteenth of the rental and to reject the other one-thirteenth. It says that, as the Circuit Court of Appeals has held that its attempted election was invalid and ineffective for the purpose, it should have equitable relief from the oppressive obligation to pay two-thirteenths on the ground of its mistake and be permitted to make an election which will relieve it from the contract to pay any rental at all, as it might have done when it became the purchaser. Such a proceeding is certainly anocillary to the enforcement of the decree of sale and the contract of purchase. Rosenbaum v. Council Bluffs Insurance Co. (C. C.) Bradshaw v. Miners' Bank of Joplin, Clearly it is a natural and closely proximate sequence of the sale by the court, and requires the interpretation of its decree and the attempted election of the purchaser under it, and the consideration of its effort to correct the alleged inequitable result. 'A purchaser or bidder at a master's sale in chancery subjects himself quoad hoc to the jurisdiction of the court, and can be compelled to perform his agreement specifically. It would seem that he must acquire a corresponding right to appear and claim, at the hands of the court, such relief as the rules of equity proceedings entitle him to.' Blossom v. Railroad Co.. It is well settled that where a bill in equity is necessary to have a construction of an order or decree of a federal court, or to explain, enforce, or correct it, a bill of this kind may be entertained by the court entering the decree even though the parties interested for want of diverse citizenship could not be entitled by original bill in the federal court to have the matter there litigated. Julian v. Central Trust Co., Minnesota Co. v. St. Paul Co., Wabash Railroad v. Adelbert College, L. Ed. 379; Hoffman v. McClelland, L. Ed. 845.

The District Court had jurisdiction and the decree dismissing the petition should be reversed.

270 U.S. 117
GOLDSMITH, Certified Public Accountant of State of New York,
v.
UNITED STATES BOARD OF TAX APPEALS.
Argued Nov. 30, 1925.
1
H. Ely Goldsmith, a citizen of New York and qualified to practice as a certified public accountant by certificate issued under the laws of that state, filed a petition in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, asking for a writ of mandamus against the United States Board of Tax Appeals, created by the Revenue Act of (Comp. St. Supp. b)) to compel the board to enroll him as an attorney, with the right to practice before it, and to enjoin the board from interfering with his appearance before it in behalf of taxpayers whose interests are there being dealt with.
1
2
The petition avers that the board has published rules for admission of persons entitled to practice before it, by which attorneys at law admitted to courts of the United States and the states, and the District of Columbia, as well as certified public accountants duly qualified under the law of any state or the District are made eligible. The applicant is required to make a statement under oath, giving his name, residence, and the time and place of his admission to the bar, or of his qualification as a public accountant, and disclosing whether he has ever been disbarred, or his right to practice as a certified accountant has ever been revoked. The rules further provide that the board may in its discretion deny admission to any applicant, or suspend or disbar any person after admission.
2
3
The petitioner says that pursuant to these rules he made application showing that he was a public accountant of New York duly certified, and that his certificate was unrevoked; that he thereupon filed petitions for taxpayers before the board, but that he was then advised, September 5, 1924, by the board that the question of his admission to practice had been referred to a committee for investigation; that in due course he would be notified whether the committee desired him to appear before it, and of its action in the premises; and that on September 27 he received notice that his application had been received, considered, and denied. It does not appear that he made any further application to the board to be heard upon the question of his admission, but filed his petition for mandamus at once. In his petition, he denies the power of the board to make rules for admission of persons to practice before it.
3
4
Upon the filing of the petition, a judge of the Supreme Court of the District ordered a rule against the board to show cause. The members of the board answered the rule as if they were individual defendants, and set out at considerable length the discharge of the petitioner for improper conduct as examiner of municipal accounts in the office of state comptroller of New York (People ex rel. Goldschmidt v. Travis, App. Div. , and the rejection of the petitioner as an applicant for admission to practice in the Department of the Treasury because of improper advice to clients, as grounds upon which the committee and the board had denied his application to practice before it.
4
5
To this answer the petitioner replied consenting to the appearance of individual members of the board as defendants, denying some of the charges made, but averring that they were none of them competent evidence on the issue presented and were merely hearsay, and that the action in New York and in the Treasury Department was due to prejudice against him for doing his duty. To this reply the defendants demurred. Upon the issue thus presented, the Supreme Court dismissed the petition for mandamus.
5
6
The Court of Appeals of the District affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court (App. D. C. , and the case has been brought here on error under section of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. § , as a case in which the construction of a law of the United States is drawn in question.
6
7
The chief issue made between the parties is whether the Board of Tax Appeals has power to adopt rules of practice before it by which it may limit those who appear before it to represent the interest of taxpayers to persons whom the board deem qualified to perform such service and to be of proper character.
7
8
The board is composed of members appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, with a chairman appointed by the board. It is charged with the duty of hearing and determining appeals from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on questions of tax assessments for deficiencies in returns of taxpayers. Notice and opportunity of be heard is to be given to the taxpayer. Hearings before the board are to be open to the public. The board may subpoena witnesses, compel the production of papers and documents, and administer oaths. The duty of the board and each of its divisions into which it may be divided is to make a report in writing of its findings of fact and decision in each case. In any subsequent suit in court by the taxpayer to recover amounts paid under its decision, its findings of fact shall be prima facie evidence. It is further provided by the act that 'the proceedings of the board and its divisions shall be conducted in accordance with such rules of evidence and procedure as the board may prescribe.' The last sentence in the title providing for the board is: 'The board shall be an independent agency in the executive branch of the government.'
8
9
We think that the character of the work to be done by the board, the quasi judicial nature of its duties, the magnitude of the interests to be affected by its decisions, all require that those who represent the taxpayers in the hearings should be persons whose qualities as lawyers or accountants will secure proper service to their clients and to help the board in the discharge of its important duties. In most of the executive departments in which interests of individuals as claimants or taxpayers are to be passed on by executive officers or boards, authority is exercised to limit those who act for them as attorneys to persons of proper character and qualification to do so. Not in frequently, statutory provision is made for requiring a list of enrolled attorneys to which a practitioner must be admitted by the executive officer or tribunal. Act July (Comp. St. § 385); Act July (Comp. St. § 684); Act June (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, § 400 4/5 f). In view of these express provisions, it is urged that the absence of such authority in case of the Board of Tax Appeals should indicate that it was not intended by Congress to give it the power. Our view, on the contrary, is that so necessary is the power and so usual is it that the general words by which the board is vested with the authority to prescribe the procedure in accordance with which its business shall be conducted include as part of the procedure rules of practice for the admission of attorneys. It would be a very curious situation if such power did not exist in the Board of Tax Appeals when in the Treasury Department and the office of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue there is a list of attorneys enrolled for practice in the very cases which are to be appealed to the board.
9
10
Our conclusion in this case is sustained by the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in Manning v. French, L. R. A. That was a suit for tort against members of the Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims for unjustly depriving an attorney of the privilege of practicing before it. The court was given by statute power to make rules for regulating the forms and mode of procedure for the court, and this was held to include the power to make rules for the admission of persons to prosecute claims before the court as agents or attorneys for the claimants. It was pointed out in support of the construction that claimants were not compelled to appear in person to present their claims as the taxpayers are not before the Board of Tax Appeals. The fact that in the Manning Case the body was called a court, and that here the board was an executive tribunal, does not make the decision inapplicable. The Court of Alabama Claims was certainly not a United States court under the third article of the Constitution. It was rather a commission to aid the fulfillment of an international award with judicial powers.
10
11
It is next objected that no opportunity was given to the petitioner to be heard in reference to the charges upon which the committee acted in denying him admission to practice. We think that the petitioner having shown by his application that being a citizen of the United States and a certified public accountant under the laws of a state, he was within the class of those entitled to be admitted to practice under the board's rules, he should not have been rejected upon charges of his unfitness without giving him an opportunity by notice for hearing and answer. The rules adopted by the board provide that 'the board may in its discretion deny admission, suspend or disbar any person.' But this must be construed to mean the exercise of a discretion to be exercised after fair investigation, with such a notice, hearing and opportunity to answer for the applicant as would constitute due process. Garfield v. United States, ex rel. Spalding, United States ex rel. Wedderburn v. Bliss, Philips v. Ballinger. 
11
12
The petitioner as an applicant for admission to practice was, therefore, entitled to demand from the board the right to be heard on the charges against him upon which the board has denied him admission. But he made no demand of this kind. Instead of doing so, he filed this petition in mandamus in which he asked for a writ to compel the board summarily to enroll him in the list of practitioners, and to enjoin it from interfering with his representing clients before it. He was not entitled to this on his petition. Until he had sought a hearing from the board, and been denied it, he could not appeal to the courts for any remedy and certainly not for mandamus to compell enrollment. Nor was there anything in the answer, reply or demurrer which placed him in any more favorable attitude for asking the writ.
12
13
This conclusion leads us to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
13
14
Affirmed.

MORSE
v.
UNITED STATES.
270 U.S. 154
ROGERS
v.
UNITED STATES.
Argued Jan. 20 and 21, 1926.
1
Wilbur Rogers was a major of Field Artillery in the Regular Army of the United States until January 26, 1921, when by an order, of that date, issued by the Secretary of War, he was placed on the retired list, under section 24b of the Act of June 4, 1920. On the ground that the order was illegal and void, he brought this action in the Court of Claims to recover the difference between the pay and allowances of a major of Field Artillery on the active list from January 26, 1921, to January 26, 1922, and the retired pay for the same period which he actually received; this difference amounting to about $ A general traverse was entered, and the issues were heard and findings of fact made by the court.
1
2
The Act of June (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. ), commonly called the Reorganization Act, provides:
2
3
'Sec. 24b. Classification of Officers.-Immediately upon the passage of this act, and in September of and every year thereafter, the President shall convene a board of not less than five general officers, which shall arrange all officers in two classes, namely: Class A, consisting of officers who should be retained in the service, and class B, of officers who should not be retained in the service. Until otherwise finally classified, all officers shall be regarded as belonging to class A, and shall be promoted according to the provisions of this act to fill any vacancies which may occur prior to such final classification. No officer shall be finally classified in class B until he shall have been given an opportunity to appear before a court of inquiry. In such court of inquiry he shall be furnished with a full copy of the official records upon which the proposed classification is based and shall be given an opportunity to present testimony in his own behalf. The record of such court of inquiry shall be forwarded to the final classification board for reconsideration of the case, and after such consideration the finding of said classification board shall be final and not subject to further revision except upon the order of the President. Whenever an officer is placed in class B, a board of not less than three officers shall be convened to determine whether such classification is due to his neglect, misconduct or avoidable habits. If the finding is affirmative, he shall be discharged from the Army; if negative, he shall be placed on the unlimited retire list with pay,' etc.
3
4
The Court of Claims found that the law had been complied with and dismissed the petition.
4
5
The grounds relied on by the petitioner for the appeal, as stated in his brief, are:
5
6
First, that plaintiff was prevented by military law from going forward before the court of inquiry with testimony which he desired to give, which was necessary to meet the adverse charges in his record which were before the court of inquiry and the prima facie case made out against him by the provisional classification board.
6
7
Second, that the record of the court of inquiry was not a complete record as required by law, in that there is no mention of the peremptory closing of the court, and nothing to show that the new evidence which Maj. Rogers desired to give was excluded.
7
8
Third, that the court of inquiry made an error of law when it assumed that it could arbitrarily exclude the testimony of Maj. Rogers and other witnesses, once it had determined to recommend that Maj. Rogers be retained on the active list, inasmuch as its decision was not final, as shown by the case and provided by the statute.
8
9
Fourth, that the Court of Claims made an error of law when it made a finding of fact that Maj. Rogers was excused as a witness and did not complete the testimony which he desired to give, although he was not prevented from doing so by the court.
9
10
After the preliminary board of classification had classified the plaintiff in class B, he applied for opportunity to appear before a court of inquiry, which was duly appointed and convened at Chicago, November 20, 1920. He was assisted by counsel. Lieut. Col. Horace F. Sykes, of the Infantry. The plaintiff was furnished with copies from the official records of his service, which copies contained only the unfavorable portions of his record, upon which the action of the board was based. The plaintiff thereupon applied to the War Department for the complete record of his service, but his request was not granted. He was, however, permitted to read the complete record of his service prior to the meeting of the court of inquiry and during its proceedings. It was a complete record of plaintiff's services as an officer of the Army from the date of his first commission therein to the date of the convening of said court of inquiry.
10
11
The plaintiff called to the attention of the court of inquiry certain charges preferred against him by Col. Harry C. Williams, of the Field Artillery, as shown in the record. The court heard the plaintiff upon these charges, but discouraged any further evidence relative thereto, upon the grounds stated by the president of said court in his evidence before the Court of Claims that the court had received instructions to disregard any charges against any officer who had not been brought to trial on any charges, or to whom the charges had not been read. The plaintiff had testified that he had never been acquainted with these charges until he was notified that he had been put in class B.
11
12
While the plaintiff was on the witness stand testifying in reference to adverse reports in his record, the court, through its president, stated, 'That will be all,' whereupon he was excused as a witness, and did not complete the testimony which he desired to give, although, as the Court of Claims finds, he was not prevented from doing so by the court.
12
13
During the course of the hearing before the court of inquiry, the presiding officer addressed plaintiff's counsel as follows:
13
14
'It is the suggestion of the court, merely a suggestion, you understand, that counsel rest his case.' Counsel for the plaintiff thereupon stated to the court that he had more evidence that he desired to submit, whereupon the presiding officer stated:
14
15
'I wish to repeat that it is the suggestion of the court that counsel rest his case.'
15
16
Thereupon the counsel for the plaintiff again stated to the court that he had other evidence, and that there were six witnesses in the building whom he desired to call, and a seventh witness who was in the city and waiting to be called by telephone. The presiding officer thereupon stated emphatically, striking his hand forcibly on his desk:
16
17
'I wish to reiterate that it is the suggestion of the court that counsel rest his case.'
17
18
The plaintiff thereupon closed his case. At the time plaintiff had in the same building wherein the court was sitting, six witnesses, and a seventh witness, an army officer, waiting to be notified by telephone to appear. These witnesses would have testified as to the charges which the court had decided to ignore, but were not called by the plaintiff. The Court of Claims finds that the plaintiff made no protest to the court because they were not called.
18
19
A copy of the official records was incorporated in the record of the court of inquiry. The court ruled as a matter of law that a favorable efficiency report could be discussed, but should not be incorporated in the record of the court, because these reports were on file in the War Department and would be considered, as they were, by the final board of classification.
19
20
At the conclusion of the hearing the court of inquiry made the following determination:
20
21
'The court is of the opinion that Maj. Wilbur Rogers should not be continued in class B.'
21
22
It appears that the plaintiff by mail, having received the record of the court of inquiry, complained to the recorder of the court that the record contained errors, but that the recorder refused to rectify them.
22
23
The final classification board, after considering the record received from the court of inquiry as additional evidence, finally classified the plaintiff in class B.
23
24
It does not appear to us that there in anything in the findings of the Court of Claims to show that the proceedings by which the plaintiff was classified in class B. were rendered invalid. This court has had occasion to consider the Reorganization Act under which this retirement was ordered. In the case of French v. Weeks, we said:
24
25
'The Army Reorganization Act is intended to provide for a reduction of the Army of the United States to a peace basis while maintaining a standard of high efficiency. To contribute to this purpose, Congress made elaborate provision in the act for retaining in the service officers who had proved their capacity and fitness for command, and for retiring or discharging those who, for any reason, were found to be unfit. Every step of this process is committed to military tribunals, made up of officers who by experience and training should be the best qualified men in the country for such a duty, but with their action all subject, as we shall see, to the supervisory control of the President of the United States.
25
26
'Not being in any sense a penal statute, the act should be liberally construed to promote its purpose, and it is of first importance that that purpose shall not be frustrated by unnecessarily placing technical limitations upon the agencies which are to carry it into effect.'

It is conceded on behalf of the plaintiff that the procedure required by the statute was followed in the organization of the boards and the court of inquiry. It was objected in the court below and in the assignments of error here that the plaintiff was not furnished with a copy of the official records in the court of inquiry upon which the proposed classification was based. As a matter of fact, he was furnished with a written copy for his own keeping and use of everything that was adverse to him in his record, and he was given in the court of inquiry a full opportunity to consult his entire record. We do not think that the difference between what was required by the statute and what was actually afforded him in the matter was of sufficient substance to invalidate the proceedings.
27
28
The chief complaint of plaintiff, when the briefs in his behalf are analyzed, is that he was prevented by the court from introducing additional evidence of cumulative character to disprove charges which the court of inquiry, upon the statement in the plaintiff's own evidence that he had never been presented with the charges and never been called upon to answer them, completely ignored. The court did so, as explained by the president of the court of inquiry, in accordance with instructions received by the court to disregard any charges against any officer who had not been brought to trial on them, or to whom they had not been read. The recommendation of the court of inquiry was that the plaintiff be retained in class A. This was doubtless the reason why the court of inquiry did not think it necessary to call additional witnesses, especially in reference to a subject-matter that could not affect the standing of the officer. In the absence of any other circumstances, and in the face of the presumption of regularity that must obtain in proceedings of this sort, we cannot assume that the final board of classification considered, as a basis for putting the plaintiff in class B, charges which had never been presented to him, charges which he denied, and charges which the court of inquiry ignored.
28
29
It is claimed that the plaintiff was injured by the failure of the recorder of the court to include in the record of the court of inquiry the colloquy between the plaintiff and his counsel on the one hand, and the court of inquiry on the other, with reference to discontinuing the hearing. We do not think that, if the colloquy had been put in the record, it would have made any substantial difference in its effect. We have no means of knowing exactly what the record of the court of inquiry as forwarded to the board of final classification contained, except from the finding of the Court of Claims, which shows that it contained all that the plaintiff put in in the way of records and documents and his evidence. In view of this we cannot assume that the complaint by the plaintiff that the record was defective was well founded.
29
30
The Court of Claims found that the plaintiff was not prevented from putting in the additional evidence on the charges which were subsequently ignored. It is argued to us that the attitude of the court was in effect and as a matter of military law a military order preventing the submission of further evidence, and making it a military offense for the plaintiff to have insisted on introducing his witnesses. Were the matter important, we should have difficulty in yielding to such a view. The Court of Claims finds in effect that the action of plaintiff in not producing further evidence was voluntary acquiescence by him in the suggestion of the court. He had counsel who presumably knew his rights under the statute, and, if such evidence was deemed material and important, we must assume that the counsel would have asserted his right and insisted on the production of the evidence.
30
31
Much of the briefs of counsel for the plaintiff in error is made up of statements based on, and quotations from, the evidence before the Court of Claims. We cannot consider this. We are limited to the findings of the Court of Claims. United States v. Smith, Stone v. United States, L. Ed. 477; Crocker v. United States, L. Ed. 533; Brothers v. United States, L. Ed. 859.
31
32
There is nothing in the record before us which would justify us in holding the proceedings invalid. The judgment is
32
33
Affirmed.

WHITE
v.
UNITED STATES et al.
Argued Jan. 26, 1926.
1
George White, a soldier in the American army during the late war, on July 1, 1918, took out insurance upon his life for $under the War Risk Insurance Act of October Stat. Comp. St. Ann. Supp. ). He designated his mother, the appellant, as beneficiary, but by a letter of the same date, since established as his will, he provided that one-half of the sums paid shold go to his aunt, Lucy Reeves, who at that time was not among those to whom the statute allowed the policy to be made payable. Section u). He died on October 4, 1918, and thereafter monthly installments of $were paid to the mother through January, 1921. The award of the whole to her then was suspended on the ground that by the will the aunt was entitled to one-half. The Act of December (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. , had enlarged the permitted class of beneficiaries to include aunts among others and had provided that the section should be deemed to be in effect as of October 6, 1917, and, with proper safeguards, that awards of insurance should be revised in accordance with the amended act. On October 9, 1923, the mother filed a petition under section of the Act of and the Act of May (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. vv, note), to establish her claim to the whole, and set up that to give effect to the Act of would be to deprive her of her property without due process of law contrary to the Constitution of the United States. The District Court decided in favor of the aunt. 
1
2
Mrs. White appealed to this court in August, 1924, and it fairly may be assumed that the Act of March (Comp. St. Supp. , giving the appellate jurisdiction to the Circuit Court of Appeals does not apply.
2
3
Mrs. White's argument, of course, is that, although the statute allowed a beneficiary to be named by will, it did not extend the benefit to aunts, so that her son's will was ineffective at the time when it was established; that therefore the mother's interest vested as absolute at the son's death, and could not be defeated by later legislation. But this argument fails when the precise position of the parties is understood.
3
4
The certificate of insurance provided in terms that it should be 'subject in all respects to the provision of such Act (of , of any amendments thereto, and of all regulations thereunder, now in force or hereafter adopted, all of which, together with the application for this insurance, and the terms and conditions published under authority of the Act, shall constitute the contract.' These words must be taken to embrace changes in the law no less than changes in the regulations. The form was established by the Director with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury and on the authority of article 1, § 1, and article of the Act (Comp. St. Comp. St. Ann. Supp. uu), which, we have no doubt, authorized it. The language is very broad and does not need precise discussion when the nature of the plan is remembered The insurance was a contract, to be sure, for which a premium was paid, but it was not one entered into by the United States for gain. All soldiers were given a right to it and the relation of the Government to them if not paternal was at least avuncular. It was a relation of benevolence established by the Government at considerable cost to itself for the soldier's good. It was a new experiment in which changes might be found necessary, or at least, as in this case, feasible more exactly to carry out his will. If the soldier was willing to put himself into the government's hands to that extent no one else could complain. The only relations of contract were between the Government and him. White's mother's interest at his death was vested only so far as he and the Government had made it so, and was subject to any conditions upon which they might agree. They did agree to terms that cut her rights down to one-half. She is a volunteer and she cannot claim more. See Helmholz v. Horst (C. C. A.) affirming Horst v. United States (D. C.) Gilman v.

270 U.S. 181
UNITED STATES
v.
STATE OF MINNESOTA.
Aruged Jan. 4 and 5, 1926.
1
This is a suit in equity brought in this court by the United States against the state of Minnesota to cancel patents issued to her for certain lands under the swamp land grant, or, where the state has sold the lands, to recover their value and to leave the patents uncanceled as to such lands. Seven patents, for about acres, are brought in question. The first was issued May 13, 1871, and the others at different times from May 17, 1900, to June 10, 1912. The bill was filed May 7, 1923. The state answered, and the case was heard and submitted on the pleadings and much documentary evidence. The issues presented are chiefly of law.
1
2
It is not questioned that the lands were swampy and in this respect within the swamp land grant, nor that the patents were sought by the state and issued by the land officers in good faith. But it is insisted, on behalf of the United States, first, that by treaties and other engagements with the Chippewa Indians, entered into before the patents were issued, the United States became obligated to apply the lands and the proceeds of their sale exclusively to the use, support, and civilization of the Chippewas, and that this operated to exclude or withdraw the lands from the swamp land grant; secondly, that the state failed to select or claim the lands within the period prescribed in the act making the grant, and thereby lost any right which she may have had to have them patented to her; and, thirdly, that the grant was subject to a condition whereby the state was required to apply the lands or the proceeds of their sale in effecting their reclamation by means of needed ditches, and that before the patents were issued the state, by an amendment to her Constitution, had disabled herself from complying with that condition and proclaimed her purpose to apply the lands and their proceeds otherwise, and thereby and lost any right she may have had to receive the patents. Stating it in another way, the insistence, on the part of the United States, is that the lands were appropriated or set apart for the Chippewas, that the land officers, misconceiving their authority in the premises, issued the patents contrary to the provisions of the act making the swamp land grant and in disregard of obligations to the Indians which the United States had assumed and was bound to respect, that those obligations are still existing and must be performed, and that to enable the United States to proceed with their performance it is entitled to a cancellation of the patents as respects such of the lands as still are held by the state and to recover the value of such as she has sold.
2
3
Besides disputing the several contentions just stated, the state advances two propositions, either of which her counsel conceive must end the case.
3
4
The first proposition is that the suit is essentially one brought by the Indians against the state, and therefore is not within the original jurisdiction of this court. In support of the proposition it is said that the United States is only a nominal party, a mere conduit through which the Indians are asserting their private rights; that the Indians are the real parties in interest, and will be the sole beneficiaries of any recovery; and that the United States will not be affected, whether a recovery is had or denied.
4
5
It must be conceded that, if the Indians are the real parties in interest and the United States only a nominal party, the suit is not within this court's original jurisdiction. New Hampshire v. Louisiana, L. Ed. 656; Hans v. Louisiana, North Dakota v. Minnesota, L. Ed. 342. But the allegations and prayer of the bill-by which the purpose and nature of the suit must be tested-give no warrant for saying that the Indians are the real parties in interest and the United States only a nominal party. At the outset the bill shows that the Indians, although citizens of the state, are in many respects, and particlarly in their relation to the matter here in controversy, under the guardianship of the United States and entitled to its aid and protection. This is followed by allegations to the effect that the Indians had an interest in the lands before and when they were patented to the state, that the patents were issued by the land officers without authority of law and in violation of an existing obligation of the United States to apply the lands and the proceeds of their sale exclusively to the use and benefit of the Indians, and that it is essential to the fulfillment of that obligation that the lands-or, where any have been sold, their value in their stead-be restored to the control of the United States. And the prayer is for a decree compelling such a restoration and declaring that the lands and moneys are to be held, administered, and disposed of by the United States conformably to that obligation.
5
6
Whether in point of merits the bill is well grounded or otherwise, we think it shows that the United States has a real and direct interest in the matter presented for examination and adjudication. Its interest arises out of its guardianship over the Indians, and out of its right to invoke the aid of a court of equity in removing unlawful obstacles to the fulfillment of its obligations, and in both aspects the interest is one which is vested in it as a sovereign. Heckman v. United States, United States v. Osage County, La Motte v. United States, L. Ed. 410; Cramer v. United States, L. Ed. 622; United States v. Beebe, L. Ed. 121; United States v. New Orleans Pacific Ry. Co., L. Ed. 388. And see United States v. Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. Co., L. Ed. 81; In re Debs, L. Ed. 1092.
6
7
Counsel for the state point out that the Indians could neither sue the state to enforce the right asserted in their behalf nor sue the United States for a failure to call on the state to surrender the lands or their value, and from this they argue that the United States is under no duty, and has no right, to bring this suit. But the premise does not make for the conclusion. The reason the Indians could not bring the suits suggested lies in the general immunity of the state and the United States from suit in the absence of consent. Of course, the immunity of the state is subject to the constitutional qualification that she may be sued in this Court by the United States, a sister state, or a foreign state. United States v. Texas, et seq., Otherwise her immunity is like that of the United States. But immunity from suit is not based on and does not reflect an absence of duty. So the fact that the Indians could not sue the United States for a failure to demand that the state surrender the lands or their value does not show that the United States owes no duty to the Indians in that regard. Neither does the fact that they could not sue the state show that the United States is without right to sue her for their benefit. But it does make for and emphasize the duty, and therefore the right, of the United States to sue. This is a necessary conclusion from the ruling in United States v. Beebe, supra, where much consideration was given to the duty and right of the United States in respect of the cancellation of patents wrongly issued. This court there pointed out special instances in which the government might with propriety refrain from suing and leave the individuals affected to settle the question of title by personal litigation, and then said that where the patent, if allowed to stand 'would work prejudice to the interests or rights of the United States, or would prevent the government from fulfilling an obligation incurred by it, either to the public or to an individual, which personal litigation could not remedy, there would be an occasion which would make it the duty of the government to institute judicial proceedings to vacate such patent.'
7
8
The state's second proposition is that the suit is barred by the provision in the Act of March being Comp. St. § (also chapter , limiting the time within which the United States may sue to annul patents, and, if not by that provision, then by a law of the state. But both branches of the proposition must be overruled. The provision in the act of has been construed and adjudged in prior decisions-which we see no reason to disturb-to be strictly a part of the public land laws and without application to suits by the United States to annul patents, as here, because issued in alleged violation of rights of its Indian wards and of its obligations to them. Cramer v. United States, supra, page ; La Roque v. United States, Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, L. Ed. 544. And it also is settled that state statutes of limitation neither bind nor have any application to the United States, when suing to enforce a public right or to protect interests of its Indian wards. United States v. Thompson, United States v. Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. Co., supra, pages ; Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Co. v. United States, L. Ed. 889.
8
9
We come therefore to the merits, which involve a consideration of the past relation of the Indians to the lands and of the nature and operation of the swamp land grant to the state.
9
10
The lands are all within the region formerly occupied by the Chippewas. By a treaty made in 1837 the Indians ceded the southerly part of that region to the United States (; and by a treaty made in 1855 they ceded to it a further part adjoining that ceded before (. But by the latter treaty nine reservations were set apart out of the ceded territory as 'permanent homes' for designated bands. Four of these reservations were called the Mille Lac, the Leech Lake, the Winnibigoshish, and the Cass Lake. This was the situation ion when the swamp land grant theretofore made to other states was extended to Minnesota. Most of the lands in question are within what was then ceded territory and outside those reservations. The rest are within the Mille Lac, Leech Lake, Winnibigoshish, and Cass Lake Reservations as then defined.
10
11
By a treaty made in 1863 six of the reservations, including the Mille Lac, but not the Leech Lake, the Winnibigoshish, or the Cass Lake, were ceded to the United States, and a large reservation surrounding the Leech Lake, the Winnibigoshish, and the Cass Lake Reservations, was set apart as 'future homes' for the Indians then on the ceded reservations. The twelfth article of that treaty declared that the Indians were not obligated to remove from the old reservations to the new until certain stipulations respecting preparations for their removal were complied with by the United States. The United States complied with the stipulations and most of the Indians on the ceded reservations other than the Mille Lac removed, but some remained on and around those reservations. The same article declared:
11
12
'Owing to the heretofore good conduct of the Mille Lac Indians (the bank occupying the ceded Mille Lac reservation), they shall not be compelled to remove as long as they shall not in any way interfere with or in any manner molest the persons or property of the whites.'
12
13
Some of the Mille Lac band removed, but many remained on and around the ceded reservation. A treaty negotiated in 1864, and amended and ratified in 1865, enlarged the large reservation set apart in By a treaty made in 1867 the greater part of the large reservation set apart in 1863 and enlarged in 1865 was ceded to the United States, and an area of approximately 36 townships around White Earth Lake was set apart as a new reservation, to which the Indians in the ceded territory were to remove. That treaty left the Leech Lake, Winnibigoshish, and Cass Lake Reservations within what remained of the large reservation established in After the White Earth Reservation was created, many of the Indians in the ceded territory removed to it, but some remained on or around the ceded tracts. By executive orders made in additions were made to some of the reservations. The next change came in 1889.
13
14
Under the Act of January the Chippewas ceded and relinquished to the United States all of their reservations, here described as then existing, save as a part of the White Earth Reservation was set aside for allotments in severalty, which were to be made by the United States and accepted by the Indians as their homes. The cession was declared to be for the purposes and on the terms stated in that act, and was to become effective on the President's approval, which was given March 4, 1890. The act provided that the lands so ceded should be surveyed, classified as pine or agricultural, and disposed of at regulated prices, and that the net proceeds should be put into an interest-bearing fund of which the Chippewas were to be the beneficiaries.
14
15
The Mille Lac reservation, although included in the cession of was again included in the cession under the act of It was surveyed and opened to settlement and disposal under the public land laws after the cession of but this led to a controversy with the Indians over the meaning and effect of the clause in the twelfth article of the treaty of relating to the removal of the Mille Lac band, and that controversy resulted in a suspension of disposals. The controversy continued up to the cession under the act of and was adjusted and composed in that cession. United States v. Mille Lac Band of Chippewas, But after the survey and before the suspension about shown by the field notes of the survey to be swampy, were patented to the state under the swamp land grant. The patent of May 13, 1871, was for these lands.
15
 under a permissive statute, the Mille Lac band brought a suit against the United States in the Court of Claims to recover for 'losses sustained by them or the Chippewas of Minnesota' by reason of the opening of the Mille Lac Reservation to settlement and disposal. In that suit recovery was sought in respect of all lands in that reservation which the United States had disposed of otherwise than under and in conformity with the act of including those patented to the state as swamp lands May 13, 1871. Evidence was introduced showing the lands so patented and their value, and one of the questions discussed in the briefs and pressed for decision at the final hearing was whether the Indians were entitled to recover in respect of the lands in that patent, or were precluded therefrom by a provision in the act of as accepted by the Indians, which the United States insisted had operated to confirm the state's claim under the patent. By the ultimate findings and judgment that controversy was resolved against the Indians and in favor of the United States. No appeal was taken from that judgment and it became final. It awarded about $to the Indians on account of the disposal of other lands, held not within the confirmatory provision, and the award was paid by putting the money in the Chippewa fund before mentioned. Of course, the United States is without right to any recovery here in respect of the lands as to which it was adjudged there to be free from any obligation or responsibility to the Indians. So the lands in the patent of May 13, 1871, need not be considered further.
16
17
The other reservations were surveyed after the cession under the act of The field notes of the survey showed some of the lands to be swampy, and acres so shown were patented to the state under the swamp land grant. They are the lands for which patents were issued from May 17, 1900, to June 10, 1912. Of these lands acres were within the Leech Lake, Winnibigoshish, and Cass Lake Reservations as defined and existing in 1860, when the swamp land grant was extended to the state, and the others are lands which had been ceded by the treaty of and were public lands in 1860.
17
18
In the brief on behalf of the United States an effort is made to overcome the cession in the treaty of by inviting attention to particular statements in correspondence and other papers of that period and arguing therefrom that the treaty was hastily negotiated with chiefs and warriors, not fairly representative of the bands affected, who were brought to Washington for the purpose and were there subjected to influences and pressure which prevented them from exercising a free judgment and adequately portraying and protecting the interests of such bands. But we think the argument is without any real basis in fact. The inferences sought to be drawn from the statements to which attention is invited are refuted rather than supported by the papers as a whole. While it appears that there was some dissatisfaction with the original selection of those who were to represent the Indians, it also appears that other chiefs and warriors representing the Indians who were dissatisfied were sent to Washington by the local superintendent of Indian affairs and that they actively participated in the negotiations and signed the treaty. The negotiations occupied ten sessions spread over a period of seven days and were reported. The reports indicate that the Indians who participated ably and loyally represented all the bands and spoke for them openly and with effect. Indeed, they persuaded the representatives of the United States to make concessions advantageous to all the bands which were much more favorable than those first proposed. They included headchiefs, subchiefs and warriors, 16 in all. Several had represented these Chippewas in making earlier treaties, and afterwards came to represent them in making others.
18
19
But, while the earnestness of counsel has induced us to examine the basis of the argument advanced, there is another reason why the effort to overcome the cession must fail. Under the Constitution the treaty-making power resides in the President and Senate, and when through their action a treaty is made and proclaimed it becomes a law of the United States, and the courts can no more go behind it for the purpose of annuling it in whole or in part than they can go behind an act of Congress. Among the cases applying and enforcing this rule some are particularly in point here. In United States v. Brooks, where a grant made to certain individuals by the Caddo Indians in a treaty between them and the United States was assailed by the United States as induced by fraud practiced on the Indians, the court held that 'the influences which were used to secure' the grant could not be made the subject of judicial inquiry for the purpose of overthrowing the treaty provision making it. In Doe v. Braden, a provision in the treaty whereby Spain ceded Florida to the United States which annulled a prior grant to the Duke of Alagon was assailed as invalid on the ground that the king, who made the treaty, was without power under the Spanish constitution to annul the grant. But the court refused to go behind the treaty and inquire into the authority of the king under the law of Spain-and this because, as was explained in the decision, it was for the President and Senate to determine who should be recognized as empowered to represent and speak for Spain in the negotiation and execution of the treaty, and as they had recognized the king as possessing that power it was not within the province of the courts to inquire whether they had erred in that regard. And in Fellows v. Blacksmith, where a treaty with the New York Indians was asserted to be invalid on the ground that the Tonawanda band of Senecas was not represented in the negotiation and signing of the treaty, the court disposed of that assertion by saying:
19
20
'But the answer to this is that the treaty, after executed and ratified by the proper authorities of the government, becomes the supreme law of the land, and the courts can no more go behind it for the purpose of annulling its effect and operation than they can go behind an act of Congress.'
20
21
The propriety of this rule and the need for adhering to it are well illsutrated in the present case, where the assault on the treaty cession is made 70 years after the treaty and 40 years after the last installment of the stipulated compensation of approximately $was paid to the Indians.
21
22
By the Act of September 28, 1850, Congress granted to the several states the whole of the swamp lands therein then remaining unsold. (Comp. St. §§ . The first section was in the usual terms of a grant in presenti, its words being that the lands described 'shall be, and the same are hereby, granted.' The second section charged the Secretary of the Interior with the duty of making out and transmitting to the Governor of the state accurate lists and plats of the lands described, and of causing patents to issue at the Governor's request, and it then declared that on the issue of the patent the fee simple to the lands should vest in the state. The third section directed that, in making out the lists and plats, all legal subdivisions the greater part of which was wet and unfit for cultivation should be included, but where the greater part was not of that character the whole should be excluded. The question soon arose whether, in view of the terms of the first and second sections, the grant was in praesenti and took effect on the date of the act, or rested in promise until the issue of the patent and took effect then. The then Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Stuart, concluded that the grant was in praesenti in the sense that the state became immediately invested with an inchoate title which would become perfect, as of the date of the act, when the land was identified and the patent issued. 1 Lester's Land Laws, That conclusion was accepted by his successors, was approved by the Attorney General (9 Op. Attys. Gen. , was adopted by the courts of last resort in the states affected, and was sustained by this court in many cases. (French v. Fyan, Wright v. Roseberry, et seq., Rogers Locomotive Works v. Emigrant Co., L. Ed. 552; Work v. Louisiana, L. Ed. 259). A case of special interest here is Rice v. Sioux City & St. Paul R. R. Co., L. Ed. 289. The question there was whether the act of operated, when Minnesota became a state in 1858, to grant to her the swamp lands therein. The court answered in the negative, saying that the act of 'operated as a grant in praesenti to the states then in existence'; that it 'was to operate upon existing things, and with reference to an existing state of facts'; that it 'was to take effect at once, between an existing grantor and several separate existing grantees'; and that, as Minnesota was not then a state, the act made no grant to her.
22
23
By the Act of March Congress extended the act of to the new states of Minnesota and Oregon; the material terms of the extending act being as follows:
23
24
'That the provisions of the act (of be, and the same are hereby, extended to the states of Minnesota and Oregon: Provided, that the grant hereby made shall not include any lands which the government of the United States may have reserved, sold, or disposed of (in pursuance of any law heretofore enacted) prior to the confirmation of title to be made under the authority of the said act.
24
25
'Sec. 2. That the selection to be made from lands already surveyed in each of the states including Minnesota and Oregon, under the authority of the act aforesaid, * * * shall be made within two years from the adjournment of the Legislature of each state at its next session after the date of this act; and, as to all lands hereafter to be surveyed, within two years from such adjournment, at the next session, after notice by the Secretary of the Interior to the Governor of the state, that the surveys have been completed and confirmed.' (Comp. St. § .
25
26
The words 'be, and the same hereby are, extended,' in the principal provision, and the words 'the grant hereby made,' in the proviso, signify an immediate extension to these new states of the grant in praesenti made to other states in 1850. Other parts of the proviso signify an exclusion of particular lands from the grant as extended, but not a change in its nature. Indeed, if the grant as extended were regarded as taking effect only on the issue of the patent, the proviso would be practically an idle provision; while if the grant be regarded as in praesenti, like the original, the proviso serves a real purpose. Of course, the principal provision and the proviso are to be read together and taken according to their natural import, if that be reasonably possible-and we think it is. Thus understood, they show that Congress, while willing and intending to extend to these new states the grant in praesenti made to other states in 1850, was solicitous that the reservation, sale, and disposal of lands (pursuant to laws in existence at the date of the extension) should not be interrupted or affected pending the identification and patenting of lands under the grant, and that the proviso was adopted for the purpose of excluding from the grant as extended all lands which might be reserved, sold, or disposed of (in pursuance of any law theretofore enacted) prior to the confirmation of title under the grant-the confirmation being the issue of patent. Many acts of that period granting lands in words importing a present grant-where the lands were to be afterwards identified under prescribed directions-contained provisions excluding lands that might be disposed of in specified ways before the identification was effected. But those provisions never were regarded as doing more than excepting particular lands from the grants, and, unless there were other provisions restraining the words of present grant, the grants uniformly were held to be in praesenti, in the sense that the title, although imperfect before the identification of the lands, became perfect when the identification was effected and by relation took effect as of the date of the granting act, except as to the tracts failing within the excluding provision. St. Paul & Pacific R. R. Co. v. Northern Pacific R. R. L. Ed. 77; Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Kansas Pacific Ry. Co., Schulenberg v. Harriman. 
26
27
The act of was construed as we here construe it by Secretary Delano in , and by Secretary Schurz in ; and their construction was adopted and applied by their successors up to the time of this suit,2 and was approved by the Attorney General in 1906, 25 Op. Atty. Gen. So, even if there were some uncertainty in the act, we should regard this long-continued and uniform practice of the officers charged with the duty of administering it as persuasively determinative of its construction. United States v. Burlington & Missouri River R. R. Co., Schell's Executors v. Fauche, L. Ed. 1040; Louisiana v. Garfield, United States v. Hammers, L. Ed. 710; Logan v. Davis, L. Ed. 1121.
27

While the grant as extended to Minnesota was a grant in praesenti, it was restricted to lands which were then public. The restriction was not expressed, but implied according to a familiar rule. That rule is that lands which have been appropriated or reserved for a lawful purpose are not public, and are to be regarded as impliedly excepted from subsequent laws, grants, and disposals which do not specially disclose a purpose to include them. Wilcox v. Jackson, Leavenworth, Lawrence & Galveston R. R. Co. v. United States, Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Roberts, L. Ed. 377; Scott v. Carew, Thus the general words of the acts of must be read as subject to such an exception Louisiana v. Garfield, supra, page .

acres, before described as within the Leech Lake, Winnibigoshish, and Cass Lake Reservations as originally created, were not public lands when the grant was extended to the state, but were then reserved and appropriated for the use of the Chippewas, and so were excepted from the grant. Probably the patenting of them to the state was a mere inadvertence, for it was not in accord with rulings of the Secretary of the Interior on the subject. But, be that as it may, the patenting was contrary to law and in derogation of the rights of the Indians under the act of Therefore the United States is entitled to a cancellation of the patents as to these lands, uness the state has sold the lands, and in that event is entitled to recover their value.
29
acres, before described as within the cession of were not reserved or otherwise appropriated when the grant was extended, but were then public lands; and, being swampy in character, they were included in the grant and rightly patented under it, unless there be merit in some of the contentions of the part of the United States which remain to be considered.
30
31
It is said that these lands, although public when the grant was extended, were afterwards reserved and appropriated for the use of the Chippewas by treaties made before the title under the grant was confirmed by the issue of patents, and that this brought the lands within the exception made by the proviso. The contention appears to be in direct conflict with the words of the proviso which limit the exception made therein to lands reserved, sold or disposed of in pursuance of laws enacted before the grant was extended. But, by way of avoiding this conflict, it is said that the treaties were made in the exercise of a power conferred by the Constitution, which is a law adopted before the extension, and therefore that the lands must be held to have been reserved and appropriated in pursuance of a prior law in the sense of the proviso. We assent to the premise, but not to the conclusion. The words of the proviso are 'in pursuance of any law heretofore enacted.' We do not doubt that, rightly understood, they include a prior treaty as well as a prior statute. But we think it would be a perversion of both their natural import and their spirit to hold that they include either a subsequent treaties subsequent statute. Of course, all treaties and statutes of the United States are based on the Constitution; and in a remote sense what is done by or under them is done under it. But lands are never reserved, sold or disposed of directly under the Constitution, but only in pursuance of treaties made or statutes enacted under it. The words 'heretofore enacted,' in the proviso, are words of limitation and cannot be disregarded. They show that it is not intended to have the same meaning as it if said, 'in pursuance of any law,' and that what it means is any treaty or statute theretofore made or enacted.
31
32
It next is said-assuming the grant was in praesenti and included these lands-that in virtue of the treaty-making power the United States could, and did by the treatles of divest the state of her right in the lands and appropriate them to the use and benefit of the Chippewas. The decisions of this Court generally have regarded treaties as on much the same plane as acts of Congress, and as usually subject to the general limitations in the Constitution; but there has been no decision on the question sought to be presented here. The case of Rice v. Minnesota & Northwestern R. R. Co., L. Ed. 147, is cited as giving some color to the contention; but in so far as it has a bearing it tends the other way. The controversy there was over the validity of an act of Congress repealing a prior act making a grant of lands to the then territory of Minnesota in aid of the construction of a proposed railroad. The granting act, while containing words of present grant, declared that 'no title' should pass to the territory until a designated portion of the road was completed, and also that the lands should not inure to the benefit of any company constituted and organized prior to the date of that act. The territory, anticipating a grant in aid of the undertaking, already had attempted to transfer her rights under the grant to a company incorporated theretofore; and the litigation was with that company. The repealing act was passed less than two months after the granting act and before the construction of the road was begun. The court held that the grant was not in praesenti, because the words of present grant were fully overcome by other provisions; and also that the repealing act was valid, because no right had passed to the territory or the company up to that time. But the court deemed it proper to say (page that if the granting act had passed a present right, title or interest in the lands, the repealing act would be 'void, and of no effect,' and also (page that if the granting act had operated to give to the territory a beneficial interest in the lands, it was 'clear that it was not competent for Congress to pass the repealing act and divest the title.' But if the treaty-making power be as far reaching as is contended-which we are not now prepared to hold-we are of opinion that no treaty should be construed as intended to divest rights of property-such as the state possessed in respect of these lands-unless the purpose so to do be shown in the treaty with such certainty as to put it beyond reasonable question. And, of course, the rule before stated, that where lands have been appropriated for a lawful purpose they are to be regarded as impliedly excepted from subsequent disposals which do not specially include them, applies to treaty disposals as well as to statutory disposals.
32
33
On examining the treaties we do not find anything in them which may be said to be certainly indicative of a purpose to divest the state of her right to these lands. The areas reserved by the treaties were described in general terms-as by indicating the exterior boundaries or designating the area as a stated number of townships around a particular lake. The area were very large-one comprising more than a million acres. No doubt the descriptions were sufficient to carry the whole of each area, if free from other claims; but there was nothing in them or in the other provisions signifying a purpose to disturb prior disposals or to extinguish existing rights under them. True, it was said that the reservations were established as 'future homes' for the Indians; but this meant that the Indians were to live within the reservations, and did not have reference to any particular lands within their limits. The areas were vastly in excess of what would be needed for individual homes and farms, and included many lands wholly unfit for that purpose. The areas were dotted with lakes-some navigable-and with swamps-some almost impassable. In short, it is apparent that the treaties dealt with extensive areas in a general way and not with particular lands in a specific way. So we think they must be read as impliedly excepting the swamp lands theretofore granted to the state and leaving her right to them undisturbed.
33
34
The case of Minnesota v. Hitchcock, is cited as making for a different conclusion; but it does not do so. The question there was whether the state was entitled, under the school land grant, to sections 16 and 36 in the part of the Red Lake Reservation which was ceded under the act of That grant was expressed in words of promise, not of present grant. Title was to pass when the lands were identified by survey, if they were then public; and if at that time they were not public but otherwise disposed of, the state was to be entitled to other lands in their stead. The lands in question never had been public; and their cession under the act of was not absolute or unqualified but in trust that they be sold as provided in that act for the benefit of the Indians. After that cession the lands in the ceded part of the reservation were surveyed and the government officers took up the task of selling them in pursuance of the trust. The state then sued to establish her claim to sections 16 and 36 and to prevent their sale. The court ruled against the state, and the following excerpt from the opinion (page ) discloses the grounds on which the decision proceeded:
34
35
'Congress does not, by the section making the school land grant, either in letter or spirit, bind itself to remove all burdens which may rest upon lands belonging to the government within the state, or to transform all from their existing status to that of public lands, strictly so called, in order that the school grant may operate upon the sections named. It is, of course, to be presumed that Congress will act in good faith; that it will not attempt to impair the scope of the school grant; that it intends that the state shall receive the particular sections or their equivalent in aid of its public school system. But considerations may arise which will justify an appropriation of a body of lands within the state to other purposes, and if those lands have never become public lands the power of Congress to deal with them is not restricted by the school grant, and the state must seek relief in the clause which gives it equivalent sections.'
35
36
It further is said that, assuming the state was entitled to these lands, she lost her right by failing to make selection of them within the prescribed period after they were surveyed. There is no merit in this contention. It rests on a misconception of what constitutes a selection in the sense of the requirement in the second section of the act of before quoted. The earlier statute of in its second section, charged the Secretary of the Interior with the duty of making out and transmitting to each state accurate lists of the lands falling within the grant; and to do this it was necessary that he determine which lands were swampy and which were not swampy. The act said nothing about the evidence on which his determination should be based or the mode of obtaining the evidence. In taking up the administration of the grant, the Secretary accorded to each state a choice between two propositions: First, whether she would abide by the showing in the government surveyor's field notes; and, second, if the first proposition was not accepted, whether she would through her own agents make an examination in the field and present claims for the lands believed to be swampy accompanied by proof of their character. Some of the states elected to abide by the surveyor's field notes and others elected to take the other course. In the administration of the grant these elections were respected and given effect, save as there were some merely temporary departures. Where the election was to abide by the field notes that, without more, was regarded a continuing selection by the state of all lands thus shown to be swampy. Where the election was to take the other course the presentation of claims with supporting proofs was regarded as a selection by the state. This was the settled practice when the act of was passed; and the provision in its second section requiring that selection be made within a designated period is to be construed in the light of that practice. Neither that act nor the one of contained any other provision which reasonably could be said to require a selection by the state. Possibly the provision in the second section of the act of requiring the Secretary to make out and transmit to each state accurate lists of the lands falling within the grant might be said to lay on him a duty to make selections. But, if this was the selection meant by the second section of the act of the states could not be charged with any dereliction or neglect by reason of his delay. But we think it meant a selection by the state as that term was understood in the administrative practice. There had been objectionable delay prior to the act of on the part of some of the states in carrying out their election to make examinations in the field and present claims with supporting proof, and the second section of that act shows that it was specially directed against unnecessary delay in making that kind of selections. It evidently was intended to accord to those states reasonable opportunity for making necessary appropriations and to require that they then proceed diligently with the examinations in the field and the presentation of their claims and proofs.
36
37
Shortly after the act of the propositions theretofore submitted to other states were submitted to Minnesota by the Secretary's direction in a letter from the Commissioner of the General Land Office. After stating the propositions the Commissioner said:
37
38
'By the adoption of the first proposition the state will receive all the lands to which she is justly entitled, as the field notes of the survey are very full in characterizing or giving descriptions to the soil; and an important reason for doing so is that she will incur no expense in selecting or designating the lands.'
38
39
By an act of her Legislature, passed in , Minnesota elected to abide by the surveyors' field notes, and her Governor promptly notified the Commissioner and the Secretary of that election. It has been respected and given effect, with one temporary interruption, and has been treated as a continuing selection by the state of all lands shown by the surveyor's field notes to be swampy. 2 Copp's P. L. L. Secretary Schurz, in overruling a contention like that we now are considering, held that the action of the state Legislature in 1862, was an effective selection. 2 Copp's P. L. L. Similar contentions were pronounced untenable by the Attorney General in 1906 (25 Op. Attys. Gen. , and by the Secretary of the Interior in . On principle, as also out of due regard for the administrative practice, we think the election by the state Legislature, approved by the Governor as it was, was a timely and continuing compliance with the requirement in the second section of the act of What would have been the effect of a failure to comply with that requirement we need not consider here.
39
40
The further contention is made that the state before the issue of the patents forfeited her right to receive them by disabling herself, through an amendment to her Constitution, from complying with the provision in the act of directing that the lands passing to the state under the grant, or the proceeds of their sale, 'be applied, exclusively, as far as necessary,' in effecting their reclamation by means of needed levees and ditches. The state did declare in an amendment to her Constitution, adopted in 1881, that the lands should be sold and the proceeds inviolably devoted to the support and maintenance of public schools and educational institutions; but it does not follow that she disabled herself from reclaiming the lands or formed or declared a purpose not to reclaim them. On the contrary, her statutes enacted since the amendment and the published reports of her officers show that she adopted and proceeded to carry out extensive reclamation plans applicable to all swamp lands within her limits, that she and her municipal subdivisions expended many millions of dollars in this work, and that they are still proceeding with it. But, apart from this, the contention must fail. It rests on an erroneous conception of the effect and operation of the provision relied on, as is shown in repeated decisions of this court. We think it enough to refer to United States v. Louisiana, L. Ed. 66, for the controversy there was between the United States, the grantor, and one of the stated to which the grant was made. The court cited and reviewed the earlier cases and then said (page ):
40
41
'Under the act of the swamp lands are to be conveyed to the state as an absolute gift, with a direction that their proceeds shall be applied exclusively, as far as necessary, to the purpose of reclaiming the lands. The judgment of the state as to the necessity is paramount, and any application of the proceeds by the state to any other object is to be taken as the declaration of its judgment that the application of the proceeds to the reclamation of the lands is not necessary.'
41
42
'If the power exists anywhere to enforce any provisions attached to the grant, it resides in Congress, and not in the court.'
42
43
The same principles have been applied in later and related cases. Stearns v. Minnesota, Alabama v. Schmidt, King County v. Seattle School District, L. Ed. 339.
43
44
Finally much stress is laid on the provisions of the act of the cession under it, and resulting rights of the Indians and obligations of the United States. But it suffices here to say that the act of was without application to lands in which the Indians had no interest, that the cession under it was only of lands in which they had an interest, and that the resulting rights of the Indians and obligations of the United States were limited accordingly.
44
45
Our conclusion on the whole case is that the bill must be dismissed on the merits as to all the lands, excepting the acres described as within the Leech Lake, Winnibigoshish, and Cass Lake Reservations as defined and existing in 1860, and that as to them the United States is entitled to a decree canceling the patents for such as have not been sold by the state and charging her with the value of such as she has sold. By reason of the relation in which the United States is suing, the value should be determined on the basis of the prices which would have been controlling had the particular lands been dealt with, as they should have been, under the act of United States v. Mille Lac Band of Chippewas, supra. 
45
46
The parties will be accorded 20 days within which to suggest a form of decree giving effect to our conclusions and to present an agreed calculation of the value of so much of the acres as has been sold.

SANCHEZ
v.
DEERING.
Argued Jan. 14, 1926.
1
By a bill filed April 7, 1920, appellants sought to establish their right to one-half interest in 175 acres of land on Key Biscayne, Dade county, Fla., granted by Gov. White to Pedro Fornells January 18, 1805, when the Floridas were under the dominion of Spain. Appellee Deering acquired legal title to the whole tract June 28, 1913.
1
 under claim of ownership through conveyance from Raphael Andreu, stepson of Fornells and alleged by her to be his sole heir, Mary Ann Davis obtained confirmation of the grant in herself of the board of commissioners empowered under the Act of March to ascertain and confirm title to East Florida lands arising under patents, grants, concessions or orders of survey dated prior to January 24, 1818. The board's action was approved and confirmed by Act of February the lands were surveyed under direction of the Surveyor General and segregated from the public domain.
2
 Mrs. Davis and her husband deeded three acres to the United States and the Cape Florida Lighthouse was constructed thereon. They subsequently abandoned the light and, March 4, 1903, conveyed the three acres to Waters S. Davis, one of the heirs of Mary Ann Davis, whose death occurred in 1885. He had purchased the interests of all other heirs during patent for the acres issued to Mary Ann Davis, but this was not delivered until because of protest by Venancio Sanchez, who claimed an interest. This protest was overruled by the Surveyor General, the Land Commissioner, and the Secretary of the Interior. June 28, 1913, Waters S. Davis deeded the lands to Deering.

Complainants deraign their title to an undivided one-half interest through deed to Venancio Sanchez from Antonia Porsila (or Porala), daughter of Pedro Fornells and half-sister of Raphael Andreu, executed by her May the husband of Mary Ann Davis sought to interest Sanchez, then and long afterwards a merchant at St. Augustine, Fla., in developing Key Biscayne. As a result, it is alleged, Sanchez discovered that Mrs. Davis did not own the entire property, and that Antonia Porsila had inherited an interest therein. Accordingly he went to Havana and there secured the conveyance of the latter's interest.

Sanchez died in 1899. He knew Raphael Andreu, who lived for a long time at St. Augustine and probably died there, but the time is not shown. It does not appear when Antonia Porsila died.

The trial court dismissed the bill upon motion, holding that appellants were chargeable with laches, because of the long delay in seeking relief after issuance of the patent of The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this decree, upon the view that the delay extended from the survey of when Mary Ann Davis secured full legal title.

8
Under circumstances very similar to those here presented, Wilson Cypress Co. v. Del Pozoy Marcos, holds that confirmation of the Spanish grant by Congress followed by survey of the land passed the legal title. We can see no reason to depart from this view. The title of Mary Ann Davis dates from For more than 70 years thereafter appellants and their predecessors failed to assert their rights, if any, by legal proceedings. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals 'that it is too late now to enter into the merits of a claim of title which could have been asserted and enforced if good, and rejected if bad, while the witnesses who knew about it were living and could have testified with reference to it.'

SCHLESINGER et al.
v.
STATE OF WISCONSIN et al.
Argued Jan. 18, 1926.
Section 1087-1, chapter 64ff, of the Wisconsin Statutes provides:
1
2
'A tax shall be and is hereby imposed upon any transfer of property, real, personal or mixed * * * to any person * * * within the state, in the following cases, except as hereinafter provided:
2
3
'(1) When the transfer is by will or by the interstate laws of this state from any person dying possessed of the property while a resident of the state.
3
4
'(2) When a transfer is by will or interstate law, of property within the state or within its jurisdiction and the decedent was a nonresident of the state at the time of his death.
4
5
'(3) When the transfer is of property made by a resident or by a nonresident when such nonresident's property is within this state, or within its jurisdiction, by deed, grant. bargain, sale or gift, made in contemplation of the death of the grantor, vendor or donor, or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after such death. Every transfer by deed, grant, bargain, sale or gift, made within six years prior to the death of the grantor, vendor or donor, of a material part of his estate, or in the nature of a final disposition or distribution thereof, and without an adequate valuable consideration, shall be construed to have been made in contemplation of death within the meaning of this section.'
5
6
These provisions were taken from section 1, c. except that the last sentence of subdivision 3 (italicized) was added by chapter .
6
Section 1087-2, c. 64ff, imposes taxes upon transfers described by section varying from 1 to 5 per centum, according to relationship of the parties, when the value is not above $ On larger ones the rates are from two to five times higher, with 15 per centum as the maximum.
7
(chapter 64ff). 1. All taxes imposed by this act shall be due and payable at the time of the transfer, except as hereinafter provided; and every such tax shall be and remain a lien upon the property transferred until paid, and the person to whom the property is transferred and the administrators, executors, and trustees of every estate so transferred shall be personally liable for such tax until its payment.'

9
Other provisions of chapter 64ff provide for determination, assessment and collection of the tax. In the Revised Statutes of chapter 64ff became chapter 72, and section numbers were changed became etc.

10
In Estate of Ebeling ( the court held:
10
'Section 1087-1, Stats., as amended by chapter which provides that gifts of a material part of a donor's estate, made within six years prior to his death, shall be construed to have been made in contemplation of death so far as transfer taxes are concerned, constitutes a legislative definition of what is a transfer in contemplation of death, and not a mere rule of law making the fact of such gifts prima facie evidence that they were made in contemplation of death.'
11
12
Estate of Stephenson, A gift of $constitutes a material part of an estate valued at more than $ also, gifts by decedents in contemplation of death must be treated, for purposes of taxation, as part of their estates.
12
13
In re Uhilein's Will (Wis.) :
13
14
'As stated in the Schlesinger Case, the statute was enacted for the purpose of enabling the taxing officials of the state to make an efficient and practical administration of the inheritance tax law. * * * It is settled in this state that the tax attaches, not at the date of the transfer of the gift, but at the date of the death of the donor. * * * Under our decisions the gifts that have been made within six years of the donor's death, together with the amount of the estate left by the donor at the time of his death, constitute his estate, and must be administered, so far as inheritance tax proceedings are concerned, as one estate. The tax does not attach and become vested in the state until the death of the donor. When the gift is made and the donee receives it, there is no certainty that an inheritance tax will ever be levied upon the gift.'
14
15
In the present cause the Milwaukee county court found that Schlesinger died testate January 3, 1921, leaving a large estate; that within six years he had made four separate gifts, aggregating more than $ to his wife and three children; that none of these was really made in view, anticipation, expectation, apprehension or contemplation of death. And it held that because made within six years before death these gifts 'are by the express terms of section (formerly section , of the statutes subject to inheritance taxes, although not in fact made in contemplation of death.' An appropriate order so adjudged. The executors and children appealed, the Supreme Court affirmed the order (, and thereupon they brought the matter here.
15
16
Plaintiffs in error maintain that, as construed and applied below, the quoted tax provisions deprive them of property without due process of law, deny them the equal protection of the laws, and conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment.
16
17
'The tax in question is not a property tax but a tax upon the right to receive property from a decedent. It is an excise tax.' 'Such (legislative) intent was to tax only gifts made in contemplation of death. That is the only class created. The legislature says that all gifts made within six years of the donor's death shall be construed to be made in contemplation of death,' (which means) 'that they shall conclusively be held to be gifts made in contemplation of death and shall fall within the one taxable class of gifts created by the legislature.' 'In our case the legislative intent, we think, is clear that the specified gifts were to be conclusively construed to be gifts in contemplation of death.' 'We agree with the appellants that the classification made will not support a tax as one on gifts inter vivos only. Under such taxation the classification is wholly arbitrary and void. We perceive no more reason why such gifts inter vivos should be taxed than gifts made within six years of marriage or any other event. It is because only one class of gifts closely connected with and a part of the inheritance tax law is created that the law becomes valid. Gifts made in contemplation of death stand in a class by themselves, and as such they are made a part of the inheritance tax law to the end that it may be effectively administered. We adhere to the ruling in the Ebeling Case.'
17
18
No question is made of the state's power to tax gifts actually made in anticipation of death, as though the property passed by will or descent; nor is there denial of the power of the state to tax gifts inter vivos when not arbitrarily exerted.
18
19
The challenged enactment plainly undertakes to raise a conclusive presumption that all material gifts within six years of death were made in anticipation of it and to lay a graduated inheritance tax upon them without regard to the actual intent. The presumption is declared to be conclusive and cannot be overcome by evidence. It is no mere prima facie presumption of fact.
19
20
The court below declared that a tax on gifts inter vivos only could not be so laid as to hit those made within six years of the donor's death and exempt all others-this would be 'wholly arbitrary.' We agree with this view and are of opinion that such a classification would be in plain conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment. The legislative action here challenged is no less arbitrary. Gifts inter vivos within six years of death, but in fact made without contemplation thereof, are first conclusively presumed to have been so made without regard to actualities, while like gifts at other times are not thus treated. There is no adequate basis for this distinction. Secondly, they are subjected to graduated taxes which could not properly be laid on all gifts or, indeed, upon any gift without testamentary character.
20
21
The presumption and consequent taxation are defended upon the theory that, exercising judgment and discretion, the Legislature found them necessary in order to prevent evasion of inheritance taxes. That is to say, A. may be required to submit to an exactment forbidden by the Constitution if this seems necessary in order to enable the state readily to collect lawful charges against B. Rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution are not to be so lightly treated; they are superior to this supposed necessity. The state is forbidden to deny due process of law or the equal protection of the laws for any purpose whatsoever.
21
22
No new doctrine was announced in Stebbins v. Riley, cited by defendant in error. A classification for purposes of taxation must rest on some reasonable distinction. A forbidden tax cannot be enforced in order to facilitate the collection of one properly laid. Mobile, etc., R. R. v. Turnipseed, L. R. A. (N. S.) discusses the doctrine of presumption.
22
23
The judgment of the court below must be reversed. The cause will be remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
23
24
Mr. Justice SANFORD concurs in the result.
24
25
Mr. Justice HOLMES dissenting.
25
26
If the Fourteenth Amendment were now before us for the first time I should think that it ought to be construed more narrowly than it has been construed in the past. But even now it seems to me not too late to urge that in dealing with state legislation upon matters of substantive law we should avoid with great caution attempts to substitute our judgment for that of the body whose business it is in the first place, with regard to questions of domestic policy that fairly are open to debate.
26
27
The present seems to me one of those questions. I leave aside the broader issues that might be considered and take the statute as it is written, putting the tax on the ground of an absolute presumption that gifts of a material part of the donor's estate made within six years of his death were made in contemplation of death. If the time were six months instead of six years I hardly think that the power of the State to pass the law would be denied, as the difficulty of proof would warrant making the presumption absolute; and while I should not dream of asking where the line can be drawn, since the great body of the law consists in drawing such lines, yet when you realize that you are dealing with a matter of degree you must realize that reasonable men may differ widely as to the place where the line should fall. I think that our discussion should end if we admit what I certainly believe, that reasonable men might regard six years as not too remote. Of course many gifts will be hit by the tax that were made with no contemplation of death. But the law allows a penumbra to be embraced that goes beyond the outline of its object in order that the object may be secured. A typical instance is the prohibition of the sale of unintoxicating malt liquors in order to make effective a prohibition of the sale of beer. The power 'is not to be denied simply because some innocent articles or transactions may be found within the proscribed class.' Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, L. Ed. 184; Jacob Ruppert v. Caffey, L. Ed. 260. In such cases, and they are familiar, the Fourteenth Amendment is invoked in vain. Later cases following the principle of Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch are Hebe Co. v. Shaw, L. Ed. 255; Pierce Oil Co. v. Hope, L. Ed. 381. See further Capital City Dairy Co. v. Ohio, L. Ed. 171.
27
28
I am not prepared to say that the legislature of Wisconsin, which is better able to judge than I am, might not believe, as the Supreme Court of the State confidently affirms, that by far the larger proportion of the gifts coming under the statute actually were made in contemplation of death. I am not prepared to say that if the legislature held that belief, it might not extend the tax to gifts made within six years of death in order to make sure that its policy of taxation should not be escaped. I think that with the States as with Congress when the means are not prohibited and are calculated to effect the object we ought not to inquire into the degree of the nevessity for resorting to them. James Everard's Breweries v. Day, L. Ed. 1174.
28
29
It may be worth noticing that the gifts of millions taxed in this case were made from about four years before the death to a little over one year. The statute is not called upon in its full force in order to justify this tax. If I though it necessary I should ask myself whether it should not be construed as intending to get as near to six years as it constitutionally could, and whether it would be had for a year and a month.

Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE concur in this opinion.

HENRIETTA FIRST MOON
v.
STARLING WHITE TAIL et al.
Argued Jan. 29, 1926.
1
Appellant seeks to establish an interest in certain lands allotted to Little Soldier, a Ponca Indian, under the General Allotment Act of as amended by the Act of Trust patents were issued therefor in 1895, and he died March 1, 1919. It appears from the bill that the Secretary of the Interior after due consideration determined who were the heirs and in doing so eliminated appellant, although she claimed to be the only surviving lawful wife. It is alleged that upon the facts found by him the Secretary misapplied the law
1
2
The court below held, correctly we think, that it was without jurisdiction since the matter had been intrusted to the exclusive cognizance of the Secretary of the Interior by the Act of June (Comp. St. § , which provides:
2
3
'That when any Indian to whom an allotment of land has been made, or may hereafter be made, dies before the expiration of the trust period and before the issuance of a fee simple patent, without having made a will disposing of said allotment as hereinafter provided, the Secretary of the Interior, upon notice and hearing, under such rules as he may prescribe, shall ascertain the legal heirs of such decedent, and his decision thereon shall be final and conclusive.'
3
4
The question presented must be regarded as settled by what this court has said in Hallowell v. Commons, Lane v. Mickadiet, United States v. Bowling, The legislative history of the Act of Cong. Rec. vol. lends support to this construction; and abundant reason for the provision becomes apparent upon consideration of the infinite difficulties which otherwise would arise in connection with the sundry duties of the Secretary of the Interior relative to Indian allotments.
4
5
We cannot accept the suggestion that the above-quoted exclusive feature of the Act of was repealed by the Act of December which amended section 24, Judicial Code (Comp. St. § , and conferred upon District Courts jurisdiction 'of all actions, suits, or proceedings involving the right of any person, in whole or in part of Indian blood or descent, to any allotment of land under any law or treaty.' This paragraph is but a codification of provisions found in the Act of August as amended by the Act of February (Comp. St. §§ . It has reference to original allotments claimed under some law or treaty, and not to disputes concerning the heirs of one who held a valid and unquestioned allotment.

The decree is affirmed.

ISELIN
v.
UNITED STATES.
Argued Jan. 12, 1926.
1
The Metropolitan Opera House in New York City is owned by a corporation which leased it to the producing company. The use of all the parterre boxes was reserved by the lessor, with the privilege of six free admissions to each box at every performance. Before the passage of the Revenue Law of the lessor conferred upon Georgine Iselin, as owner of of its shares, a license so to use a designated parterre box. During the season of being authorized so to do, she sold through a personal agent the license to use her box for 47 of the 70 performances given during the season, and received therefor $net after deduction of the agent's commissions. On the amount received Miss Iselin was assessed a tax of $ under paragraph 3 of section (a) of the Revenue Act of Act of February (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. a). She paid the amount under protest and presented a claim that it be refunded. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue rejected the application, holding that the tax was payable under paragraph 4 of that act.1 Then Miss Iselin brought this suit in the Court of Claims to recover the amount. A judgment dismissing the petition, rendered upon findings of fact, was entered May The case is here on appeal under section of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. § .
1
2
Paragraph 3 of section a), under which the tax was assessed, provides:
2
3
'Upon tickets or cards of admission to theaters, operas, and other places of amusement, sold at news stands, hotels, and places other than the ticket offices of such theaters, operas, or other places of amusement, at not to exceed 50 cents in excess of the sum of the established price therefor at such ticket offices plus the amount of any tax imposed under paragraph (1), a tax equivalent to 5 per centum of the amount of such excess; and if sold for more than 50 cents in excess of the sum of such established price plus the amount of any tax imposed under paragraph (1), a tax equivalent to 50 per centum of the whole amount of such excess, such taxes to be returned and paid, in the manner provided in § 903, by the person selling such ticket.'
3
4
Neither stockholders' boxes nor tickets to them were on sale at any ticket office, as all the parterre boxes were reserved by the lease for the stockholders. For this reason there was no regular or established price for parterre boxes. Nor was any other box exactly like them on sale. Each sale of a stockholders' box or tickets was made as the individual transaction of a particular stockholder, for a particular performance, and to a designated purchaser. The price paid varied widely for different performances. There was, above the parterre boxes, a tier of boxes, known as the grand tier. These boxes, which were on sale at the ticket office, also had seats for six persons, were uniform in size with the stockholders' boxes, and were otherwise similar. The ticket office price for grand tier boxes was $60 for each performance. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, though sustaining the tax under paragraph 4, assessed the tax under paragraph 3, apparently on the theory that Congress intended to tax sales of boxes like the plaintiff's; that, since there was no 'regular established price or charge' for boxes exactly like hers, and no such boxes were sold at the ticket office, the basis for taxation should be sought in the established price for the class of boxes actually on sale most like hers; that it should therefore be assumed that the box office price for the similar grand tier boxes was the 'established price at the ticket offices' of parterre boxes; and that, with such price as a standard, the calculation involved in determining the item of 'any tax imposed by paragraph (1),' and in assessing the supertax under paragraph (3) should be made.2
4
5
Miss Iselin contended that section a) had no application to stockholders' boxes or tickets; that the section provided for a tax only on the tickets customarily sold at box offices, for which there is an established price there, and which are commonly sold at news stands, hotels and other places of business for higher prices; that it was the purpose of Congress to impose a small tax upon tickets sold at the ticket office, a moderate tax on those sold at a moderate advance over the ticket office price, and a large tax upon any resale of admission tickets, if made at a price above a reasonable advance on the regular price, and also a large tax upon an original sale, if made at a price in excess of the regular or established price; that tickets issued under the peculiar circumstances stated, which were received by her as an incident of her investment in the lessor company and in return for obligations assumed by her as a stockholder to ensure performance of operas, were not within the purview of the section; that she was not taxable at all, since her tickets had not been sold at a box office and there was no established price for them; but that if taxable, it could be only under paragraph 5, under which she had without protest paid a tax on these tickets amounting to $3
5
6
The Court of Claims held that the tax was properly assessed under paragraph 3. It concluded that there was an 'established price' for box tickets of this character, and that Miss Iselin herself had established the price, because, prior to the assessment to her of the tax here in question, she had paid without protest a tax assessed under paragraph 5, the amount of which the government had determined by fixing $60 as the established price on which the tax so paid was calculated. The court held that the term 'established price' did not imply a fixing of the price by the producing company or others having the general power of establishing the prices of tickets; that it was of no legal significance that plaintiff had in fact made no sale at the price fixed in the assessment, that she had actually sold the tickets for the different performances at widely varying prices, and that no sale had been made of such tickets at the ticket office.
6
7
The government concedes that neither paragraph 1, paragraph 3, paragraph 4, paragraph 5, or any other paragraph4 of section a), provides in terms for taxing a privilege like that enjoyed by the plaintiff. It makes no contention here that the tax can be sustained under any paragraph of section a) unless it be paragraph 3. It argues that Congress clearly intended to tax all sales of tickets; that there is in the section no indication of intention to exempt from the tax any sale of tickets or any resale at a profit; that the receipts here taxed are in character substantially similar to those specifically described in paragraph 3; that this general purpose of Congress should be given effect, so as to reach any case within the aim of the legislation; and that the act should, therefore, be extended by construction to cover this case. It may be assumed that Congress did not purpose to exempt from taxation this class of tickets. But the act contains no provision referring to tickets of the character here involved; and there is no general provision in the act under which classes of tickets not enumerated are subjected to a tax. Congress undertook to accomplish its purpose by dealing specifically, and in some respects differently, with different classes of tickets and with tickets of any one class under different situations. The particularization and detail with which the scope of each provision, the amount of the tax thereby imposed, and the incidence of the tax, were specified, preclude an extension of any provision by implication to any other subject. The statute was evidently drawn with care. Its language is plain and unambiguous. What the government asks is not a construction of a statute, but, in effect, an enlargement of it by the court, so that what was omitted, presumably by inadvertence, may be included within its scope. To supply omissions transcends the judicial function. Compare United States v. Weitzel, L. Ed. 872; Peoria & Pekin Union Ry. Co. v. United States. 
7
8
The government calls attention to the fact that, as early as October 24, 1919, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue made the ruling pursuant to which the tax here in question was assessed; that on March 22, 1920, the Attorney General sustained that ruling; that the provisions here in question were re-enacted without substantial change in the Revenue Act of Act Nov. (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. a), and the Revenue Act of Act June Stat. 253 (Comp. St. Supp. d), and that the administrative practice adopted in 1919 has been steadfastly pursued. It suggests that these facts imply legislative recognition and approval of the executive construction of the statute. But the construction was neither uniform, general, nor long-continued; neither is the statute ambiguous. Such departmental construction cannot be given the force and effect of law. Compare United States v. G. Falk & Brother, National Lead Co. v. United States, L. Ed. 496.

270 U.S. 295
STATE OF MICHIGAN
v.
STATE OF WISCONSIN.
Argued January 5, 1926.
1
This is an original suit in equity, brought in this court to determine the boundary between the states of Michigan and Wisconsin from the mouth of the Montreal river at Lake Superior to the ship channel entrance from Lake Michigan into Green Bay. By the Enabling Act of June 15, 1836, c. 99, 5 Stat. 49, under which Michigan became a state in this boundary is described as follows:
1
2
'* * * Thence (the mouth of the Montreal river) through the middle of the main channel of the said river Montreal, to the middle of the Lake of the Desert; thence, in a direct line to the nearest head water of the Menominee river; thence, through the middle of that fork of the said river first touched by the said line, to the main channel of the said Menominee river; thence, down the centre of the main channel of the same, to the centre of the most usual ship channel of the Green Bay of Lake Michigan; thence, through the centre of the most usual ship channel of the said bay to the middle of Lake Michigan. * * *' Section 2.
2
3
The Territory of Wisconsin was created by an Act of April and this boundary is there described in the reverse direction: * * * 'To a point in the middle of said lake (Michigan), and opposite the main channel of Green Bay, and through said channel and Green Bay to the mouth of the Menominee river; thence through the middle of the main channel of said river, to that head of said river nearest to the Lake of the Desert; thence in a direct line, to the middle of said lake; thence through the middle of the main channel of the Montreal river, to its mouth. * * *' Section 1.
3
4
The only difference between the two descriptions is that in the former the call is for the 'most usual ship channel,' while in the latter it is for the 'main channel,' of Green Bay. In the Wisconsin Enabling Act of August under which the state was admitted by the Act of May this boundary is described as:
4
5
'* * * Running with the boundary line of the state of Michigan, through Lake Michigan, Green Bay, to the mouth of the Menominee river; thence up the channel of said river to the Brule river; thence up said last mentioned river to Lake Brule ; thence along the southern shore of Lake Brule in a direct line to the centre of the channel between Middle and South Islands, in the Lake of the Desert; thence in a direct line to the headwaters of the Montreal river, as marked upon the survey made by Captain Cramm; thence down the main channel of the Montreal river to the middle of Lake Superior.
5
6
'* * * That, to prevent all disputes in reference to the jurisdiction of islands in the said Brule and Menominee rivers, the line be so run as to include within the jurisdiction of Michigan all the islands in the Brule and Menominee rivers (to the extent in which said rivers are adopted as a boundary), down to, and inclusive of, the Quinnesec Falls of the Menominee; and from thence the line shall be so run as to include within the jurisdiction of Wisconsin all the islands in the Menominee river, from the falls aforesaid down to the junction of said river with Green Bay: Provided, that the adjustment of boundary, as fixed in this act, between Wisconsin and Michigan shall not be binding on Congress, unless the same shall be ratified by the state of Michigan on or before the first day of June, one thousand eight hundred and forty-eight.' Sections 1, 2.
6
7
The history of events leading up to the present controversy extends over a period of 80 years, and the evidence, including a multitude of official and other maps and documents, constitutes a long and involved record. The case is reviewed in voluminous, but well-prepared briefs and was helpfully argued at the bar. This mass of material we have examined with the care properly due the importance of the issue and the high character of the parties litigant; but much of it may be put aside as unnecessary for final consideration, since the determination we have reached depends upon a comparatively few decisive facts and circumstances, either undisputed or clearly established.
7
8
In the briefs and oral arguments the boundary is divided for purposes of convenient discussion into three distinct sections, namely: (1) The Montreal river section, extending from the mouth of the Montreal river to the Lake of the Desert, and thence to the headwaters of the Menominee river (or to Lake Brule ); (2) the Menominee river section, extending from its headwaters (or from Lake Brule ) to Green Bay; and (3) the Green Bay section, extending from the last-named point through the center of the most usual ship channel of the Green Bay to Lake Michigan. Although our ultimate determination in respect of these three sections rests upon the same basic principle, they are so distinct in their physical characteristics and in respect of much of the evidence peculiarly applicable to each apart from the others that our conclusions will be more clearly formulated and better understood if we adopt the same plan in the examination of the questions which follow.
8
9
If we had before us nothing but the language of the Michigan Enabling Act, describing this section of the boundary as extending 'through the middle of the main channel of the said river Montreal, to the middle of the Lake of the Desert,' it would not be easy to avoid the conclusion that it was the understanding of the framers of the act that the river Montreal could be followed to a connection with the Lake of the Desert; and that such was the understanding clearly appears from the record. Moreover, maps in existence at the time of the passage of the act, which were available and must have been known to the framers, depict the Lake of the Desert (or, as it is there called, Lac Vieux Desert) as the source of the Montreal river. But the locality at that time was a wilderness, the topography of which was practically unknown, except to the aboriginal inhabitants and the occasional voyageur, trapper, and hunter, and, following the date of the passage of the act, it was found that in fact the headwaters of the Montreal did not extend to the Lake of the Desert, but fell short of it some 50 or 60 miles. It was subsequently revealed by exploration and surveys that the river from its mouth follows a winding course for several miles eastwardly, and then divides into two branches, the westerly branch to its head following a southerly direction and the easterly branch a southeasterly direction. The westerly branch finds its source in a body of water called Island Lake. The easterly branch finally divides into two small tributaries, called, respectively, the Balsam and Pine. The lake, which in our opinion is sufficiently identified as the one which Congress meant by its call for the Lake of the Desert, is several miles nearer to the point of junction of these tributaries than it is to any point on the westerly branch. Much evidence was submitted on behalf of Michigan in an effort to demonstrate that the westerly branch of the river was the larger stream, and was in fact, and was understood by Congress to be, the upper portion of that river, and that Island Lake, at the head of the westerly branch, was intended by the designation 'Lake of the Desert.' We think it fairly appears, to the contrary, that the easterly, and not the westerly, branch was, and was understood to be, the upper portion of the Montreal; but a positive conclusion to that effect is not necessary, since our judgment turns upon other and independent considerations.
9
 an act of Congress, directed that the boundary line in question be 'surveyed, marked, and designated,' and by a later act, approved July the making of the survey was placed under the superintendence of the War Department. Pursuant to this legislation, one Capt. Cram was directed to make the survey, which he proceeded to do, completing it in 1841. He submitted two reports to Congress, from which it appears that the description of the boundary 'through the middle of the main channel of the said river Montreal, to the middle of the Lake of the Desert,' was an impossible one, and that the line could not be run in complete accordance with it. Carrying out as nearly as possible what he conceived to be the intention of Congress, he fixed the headwaters of the Montreal at the junction of the Balsam and Pine, at a point designated and marked 'Astronomical Station No. 2,' from which point the line was extended in a direct course to the Lake of the Desert. His reports embodies data for the information of Congress, and recommended that action be taken by that body definitely to establish the boundary.
10
11
Capt. Cram's first report is dated December, 1840. He begins it with an analysis of the description we have quoted from the Michigan Enabling Act, from which he infers that Congress supposed that the Lake of the Desert discharged itself into the Montreal river; that somewhere between Lake Superior and Green Bay there was a known lake bearing that name, since the description is 'to the middle of the Lake of the Desert'; that of the various headwaters discharging into the Menominee river one would be found nearest to the Lake of the Desert, since that is the call; and that this would be found to be a branch of the Menominee, and not a lake, since the description is, 'through the middle of that fork * * * first touched by the said line.'
11
12
Following these inferences, he states that the Lake of the Desert has no connection either with the Montreal river or with the Menominee, but constitutes the principal head of the Wisconsin river. His conclusion is that additional action on the part of Congress will be required, to the end that the boundary may be defined 'in such a manner that it can be established either upon the ground or laid down on a map with that degree of definiteness which should always characterize a boundary line between two states.'
12
13
On January 12, 1841, the Governor of Michigan addressed a special message to the state Legislature, in which he stated that a strict adherence to the terms of the Michigan Enabling Act defining the boundary in question, according to information recently communicated to him by the state geologist, would seem to be 'absolutely impracticable.' With the message was transmitted the communication referred to, together with a sketch of the country which the governor thought would present with sufficient certainty the disagreements between the description contained in the enabling act and the actual geography of the region. Thereupon, the Legislature-evidently with Capt. Cram's report before it, since the bill avers that action was taken, 'relying on the representations made in said report as to the impossibility of locating said boundary in accordance with the (Michigan Enabling Act)'-adopted a joint resolution, reciting that from a critical examination of the country it appeared that a strict and literal conformity with the description was impossible, and that presumptively the general intent could be attained without much difficulty if the line be immediately marked and described, and requesting Congress to cause the boundary in question to be surveyed, and marked, and a commissioner appointed to act with a state commissioner, to the end that the boundary be established in conformity with the manifest general intent of the act. The state delegation in Congress was requested by the resolution to endeavor to secure congressional action to effect this object.
13
 and again in 1843, a bill was introduced in the United States Senate by a Michigan senator to amend the Michigan Enabling Act, so as to make the disputed boundary conform substantially to the line as it was subsequently defined in the Wisconsin Enabling Act, including that portion relating to the division of the islands in the Brule and Menominee rivers. These bills failed, apparently for parliamentary reasons, and not because there was any substantive objection to them. Then followed the Wisconsin Enabling Act of the pertinent words of which we have quoted. The provision of this act describing the boundary now in question, and providing for a division of the islands in the Brule and Menominee, was submitted in the House by a Michigan congressman, with the statement that it had been agreed upon between the members from Michigan and the Wisconsin delegate. Shortly thereafter, Congress directed a survey of 'so much of the line between Michigan and Wisconsin as lies between the source of Brule river and the source of Montreal river, as defined by the (Wisconsin Enabling Act),' and in pursuance thereof a survey was made by William A. Burt in 1847. Burt's line, which was marked with posts set at half-mile intervals and otherwise identified, substantially followed Cram's recommendation and is the line now claimed by Wisconsin.
14
15
It does not appear that Michigan acted affirmatively in respect of the proviso that the adjustment of boundaries as fixed in the Wisconsin Enabling Act should not be binding on Congress, unless the same should be ratified by Michigan on or before June 1, 1848. Nevertheless Wisconsin was admitted by the Act of May 29, 1848, supra, with the express provision that its boundaries should be as prescribed by the Enabling Act of .
15
16
But, while Michigan did not in terms ratify the proviso just mentioned, there was inserted in her Constitution of and ratified by the people, the following description of the boundary in question:
16
17
'* * * To the mouth of the Montreal river; thence through the middle of the main channel of the said river Montreal to the head waters thereof; thence in a direct line to the center of the channel between Middle and South Islands in the Lake of the Desert; thence in a direct line to the southern shore of Lake Brule ; thence along said southern shore and down the river Brule to the main channel of the Menominee river; thence down the center of the main channel of the same to the center of the most usual ship channel of the Green Bay of Lake Michigan; thence through the center of the most usual ship channel of the said Bay to the middle of Lake Michigan. * * *' Article 1 (Comp. L. Mich. 
17
18
This description was adopted by the constitutional convention held in 1867, with the addition of the words found in the Wisconsin Enabling Act: 'As marked upon the survey made by Captain Cram.' The same description, including the reference to the Cram survey, was again readopted by the Michigan special constitutional commission of The proceedings of both the convention and the commission show that these readoptions were made deliberately and with full understanding. Both proposed Constitutions, however, were rejected by the people, but apparently for reasons having no relation to the question of boundaries. Thus the matter rested until in which year a new and amended Constitution was adopted, containing a radically different description of the boundary in question, namely:
18
19
'* * * Thence in a direct line through Lake Superior to the mouth of the Montreal river; thence through the middle of the main channel of the westerly branch of the Montreal river to Island Lake, the head waters thereof; thence in a direct line to the center of the channel between Middle and South Islands in the Lake of the Desert; thence in a direct line to the southern shore of Lake Brule ; * * *' Article 1, § 1 (Comp. L. Mich. 
19
20
By this description for the first time the westerly branch of the Montreal was brought in and the line carried through the main channel thereof to Island Lake. During the same year, the Attorney General of the state was directed by the state Legislature to investigate and institute proceedings to secure a determination of the correct boundary. The investigation was made and reported, and again the matter rested until at which time the state Legislature provided for the appointment of a commission to investigate the 'disputed' boundary line. This commission made a report in 1921, and was continued by an act of the Legislature passed the same year. The bill was filed in this court on October 8, 1923.
20
21
When admitted to statehood, Wisconsin was, and ever since has continued to be, in possession of the area in dispute; that is to say, of all lands within the boundary which she now claims. As early as county government was established upon the basis of this boundary. In taxes were assessed and collected by Wisconsin, and by practically the entire area had been subjected to such taxation. During this time, towns were built, highways constructed, public buildings erected, elections held, Wisconsin law enforced, and other customary acts of dominion and jurisdiction exercised by that state within the disputed area.
21
22
From the foregoing facts and circumstances the conclusions are inevitable: That the description in the Michigan Enabling Act of the line from the mouth of the Montreal to the Lake of the Desert was inserted under the mistaken belief that the river connected with the lake; that this mistake was discovered as early as of which discovery Michigan, long prior to the admission of Wisconsin, had knowledge; that the line as now claimed by Wisconsin was surveyed and marked by Cram and Burt at the dates already stated; that Michigan not only assented to the result of these surveys, but actively participated in securing the insertion of the description of that line in the Wisconsin Enabling Act, and herself substantially adopted it by the Constitution of and that for a period of more than 60 years she stood by without objection, with full knowledge of the possession, acts of dominion, and claim and exercise of jurisdiction on the part of the state of Wisconsin over the area in question.
22
23
In addition to this, the line as claimed by Wisconsin has been, from the time of the Burt survey, accepted as the true boundary by the United States, and, in its surveys, plats, and maps, sales and other acts in respect of the public lands, continuously and consistently recognized, with the knowledge of Michigan and without protest on her part. Indeed, nothing appears to indicate dissatisfaction with the boundary thus established until the adoption of the Constitution of and, even then, except to the extent that this may be regarded as a continuing assertion of a claim to the boundary as there set forth or as originally described in the Michigan Enabling Act, the matter was allowed to rest until .
23
24
To meet this situation, it is contended that the state of Michigan through all these years labored under a mistake in respect of the real facts and that this was the result of excusable ignorance on her part. The contention is devoid of merit. The material facts, since at least the date of the Wisconsin Enabling Act, have been so obvious that knowledge of them on the part of the Michigan authorities, if it were not shown, as it is shown, by the evidence, must necessarily be assumed.
24
25
Notwithstanding the state of Michigan at this late day insists that the boundary now be established by a decree of this court in accordance with the description contained in her Constitution of Plainly this connot be done. That rights of the character here claimed may be acquired on the one hand, and lost on the other, by open, longcontinued, and uninterrupted possession of territory, is a doctrine not confined to individuals, but applicable to sovereign nations as well, Direct United States Cable Co. v. Anglo-American Telegraph Co. ( Wheaton, International Law (5th Eng. Ed.) Moore, International Law Digest, et seq.; and, a fortiori, to the quasi sovereign states of the Union. The rule, long settled and never doubted by this court, is that long acquiescence by one state in the possession of territory by another and in the exercise of sovereignty and dominion over it is conclusive of the latter's title and rightful authority. Indiana v. Kentucky, et seq.; Virginia v. Tennessee, Louisiana v. Mississippi, Maryland v. West Virginia, Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, L. Ed. Missouri v. Iowa, L. Ed. New Mexico v. Colorado, L. Ed. 499. That rule is applicable here, and is decisive of the question in respect of the Montreal river section of the boundary in favor of Wisconsin.
25
26
The Menominee River Section.
26
27
The description in the Michigan Enabling Act of this section of the boundary begins at the headwaters of the Menominee river nearest to the Lake of the Desert in a direct line
27
28
'thence, through the middle of that fork of the said river first touched by the said line, to the main channel of the said Menominee river; thence, down the center of the main channel of the same, to the centre of the most usual ship channel of the Green Bay.' Section 2.
28
29
The description in the act creating the territory of Wisconsin is the same, but in the opposite direction:
29
30
'* * * Thence through the middle of the main channel of said (Menominee) river, to that head of said river nearest to the Lake of the Desert; thence in a direct line, to the middle of said lake. * * *' Section 1.
30
31
But the description in the Wisconsin Enabling Act contains important differences:
31
32
'* * * Thence up the channel of said (Menominee) river to the Brule river; thence up said last mentioned river to Lake Brule ; thence along the southern shore of Lake Brule in a direct line to the centre of the channel between Middle and South Islands, in the Lake of the Desert. * * *' Section 1.
32
33
Or, stated in the order of the Michigan Constitution (article 1):
33
34
'From the center of the channel between Middle and South Islands in the Lake of the Desert in a direct line to the southern shore of Lake Brule ; thence along the southern shore of Lake Brule to the Brule river; thence down the Brule river to the Menominee; thence down the channel of the Menominee to its mouth.

The evidence shows that Lake Brule is not the head of the Menominee nearest to the Lake of the Desert, as called for by the Michigan Enabling Act, though the Brule river is the principal tributary of the Menominee, and the inference is pretty clear that the change of description was made in the Wisconsin Enabling Act as a part of a general readjustment of the boundary. At any rate, since this part of the line is not in controversy, we need not consider the matter, except as it may reflect light upon the effect of, and the question of Michigan's acquiescence in, the further provision that, to prevent disputes as to jurisdiction, the line shall be so run as to include within the jurisdiction of Michigan all islands in the Brule and Menominee, down to and including the Quinnesec Falls of the Menominee, and thence so as to include within the jurisdiction of Wisconsin all islands in the Menominee below the falls. As to this part of the line, the contention of Wisconsin is that the description in the Wisconsin Enabling Act was in effect a proposed adjustment of the boundary as an undividable unit, and that Michigan, by the Constitution of having expressly adopted that part of the line from the Lake of the Desert to Lake Brule , cannot be heard to say that she did not also adopt the adjustment of the line in respect of a division of the islands. There is force in this contention, and especially so in view of the fact that the change from the nearest headwater of the Menominee to Lake Brule operated to give Michigan additional territory. To permit her to reap the benefit of the adjustment so far as it is to her advantage, and reject it to the extent that it is advantageous to her sister state, would be plainly inequitable. We prefer, however, to rest our determination upon the conclusion, fully justified by the record, that-whatever were the rights of the respective states in respect of the islands in question immediately upon the adoption of the Constitution of Wisconsin, for a period of more than half a century following that time, had the undisputed and undisturbed possession of substantially all of the islands in the river below the Quinnesec Falls, and, without reference to the main channel of the river, exercised jurisdiction and dominion over them with the knowledge and acquiescence of the complainant.
35
36
Capt. Cram's first report to Congress, dated December, 1840, points out the impracticability of following the center of the main channel of the river: 'The 'center' of the main channel of the Menominee river is made a part of the boundary. The river contains numerous islands, and consequently more than one channel, where these islands occur. It will be impossible in many of these cases to known which is the 'main channel' of these cases to know which is the 'main channel was tried and found impossible to decide by a simple inspection or reconnaissance which was the 'main channel.' It should also be remarked here that the term 'main channel,' applied to the multiplicity of channels of the Menominee, would be somewhat ambiguous in any event-for, it may be asked: Is the main channel the widest channel of the river? Or is it the deepest? If it is the widest or deepest now, will it be the widest or deepest hereafter? Or shall the main channel be that through which the greater quantity of water shall be found to pass at the time of the survey? And if it should occur that two channels at the same island pass equal quantities of water-which would then be regarded as the boundary? These questions are sufficient to show the indefiniteness of the term 'main channel.' There are also a few islands in the Brule river to which similar questions might apply in reference to the term 'main channel.'
36
37
'To avoid all ambiguity in reference to these channels, it might be specified in the act defining the boundary that, in ascending the stream, the boundary shall follow the extreme left-hand of the Brule and the extreme right-hand channel of the Menominee down to a well-known point of the river, say Pe-me-ne Falls, and thence to follow the extreme left-hand channel of the remainder of the Menominee to its mouth. Such a division would leave most of the islands in Michigan and the remainder in Wisconsin, and would avoid much expense in minute surveys to ascertain the 'main channel,' and would leave no indefiniteness upon this part of the boundary. The free use of either channel for the purposes of navigation would, from an established principle of law, be open at all times to the citizens of either state, and the islands would be nearly distributed in equal proportions between the two states.'
37
38
Following the date of this report in respect of the impossibility-or extreme difficulty practically amounting to that-of locating the boundary in accordance with the provisions of the Michigan Enabling Act, and, it fairly may be assumed, with a view of effectuating Capt. Cram's recommendation, the Michigan Legislature passed the resolution already referred to, calling upon Congress to cause the boundary to be surveyed and marked in conformity with the manifest general intent of the Michigan Enabling Act, and requesting the delegation of the state in Congress to use their efforts to secure such action. This was followed, as already stated, by the introduction of the bills in the Senate and the subsequent insertion, by agreement between the members of Congress from Michigan and the Wisconsin delegate, of the provision in the Wisconsin Enabling Act, dividing the islands in accordance with Capt. Cram's suggestion, except in a particular not important here.
38
 the survey of all of the islands below Quinnesec Falls as a part of Wisconsin was directed by the United States Surveyor General for Wisconsin, and such survey was immediately begun and thereafter continuously prosecuted. The evidence, in our opinion, fairly shows that, as early as the greater part in area of all of them had been thus surveyed and platted as belonging to Wisconsin, including many which would fall on what Michigan claims is the Michigan side of the main channel. On behalf of Michigan, it is strongly contended that to this there are important exceptions. But, without going into details, it is enough to say that the clear weight of the evidence is to the contrary. It is true that so-called Island No. 8, or Merryman's Island, was surveyed as in both states, that the Wisconsin survey was subsequently canceled, and that thereafter exclusive jurisdiction over the tract of land constituting it was exercised by Michigan. It is said that, nevertheless, the 'island' is now claimed by Wisconsin; but, on the contrary, Wisconsin concedes that it belongs to Michigan. The fact is that the tract was originally considered to be an island, and consequently surveyed as a part of Wisconsin. Upon further investigation, it was found by the United States surveyor not to be an island, but, in realty, a part of the Michigan mainland. The Wisconsin survey was, accordingly, canceled and the title of Michigan thereafter fully conceded. Two other so-called islands of small area in the same vicinity are in like situation.
39
40
Some of these islands, comparatively small in area and of little consequence, have never been surveyed or any definite acts of dominion exercised over them by either state. But to this we attach no importance. The assertion and exercise of dominion by Wisconsin over the islands on the Michigan side of the channel was begun and has continued in virtue of, and in reliance upon, the readjustment of the boundary set forth in the Wisconsin Enabling Act. The rule is well settled in respect of individual claimants that actual possession of a part of a tract by one who claims the larger tract, under color of title describing it, extends his possession to the entire tract in the absence of actual adverse possession of some part of it by another. Clarke's Lessee v. Courtney, Hunnicutt v. Peyton, Ellicott v. Pearl, Smith v. Gale, Montoya v. Gonzales, L. Ed. 645; Houston Oil Co. of Texas v. Goodrich, Upon like grounds and with equal reason, under circumstances such as are here disclosed, the principal of the rule applies where states are the rival claimants. It results that the Wisconsin Enabling Act, together with the Act of Admission, gave color of title in that state to all of the islands within the limits there described, and that her original and continued possession, assertion, and exercise of dominion and jurisdiction over a part of these islands, pursuant to such legislation and with the acquiescence of Michigan, extended Wisconsin's possession, dominion, and jurisdiction to all of them, in the absence of actual possession of, or exercise of dominion over, any territory within the boundary by Michigan. The fact that the islands constitute separated tracts of land is of no consequence here, whatever its effect might be under other conditions. In applying the rule, the area within the described boundary, both land and water, must be considered as together constituting a single tract of territory.
40
41
We therefor hold, as to this section of the boundary, that from Lake Brule to the mouth of the Menominee the line, which is now fixed and finally established by long acquiescence, follows the channels of the Brule and Menominee, wherever they are free from islands; that wherever islands are encountered above the Quinnesec Falls the line follows the channel nearest the Wisconsin mainland, so as to throw all such islands into Michigan; and that whereever islands are encountered below the Quinnesec Falls the line follows the channel nearest the Michigan mainland, so as to throw all such islands into Wisconsin.
41
42
The Green Bay Section.
42
43
In determining the boundary through this section, the question is not embarrassed by differences of description. The calls of the Michigan Enabling Act are down the channel of the Menominee to 'the center of the most usual ship channel of the Green Bay of Lake Michigan; thence through the center of the most usual ship channel of the said bay to the middle of Lake Michigan.' The Wisconsin Enabling Act calls for the same boundary.
43
44
The evidence shows that there are two distinct ship channels, to either of which this description might apply. From the mouth of the Menominee, the channel, according to the Michigan claim, proceeds across the waters of Green Bay in an easterly direction until near the westerly shore of the Door county peninsula; thence, in close proximity to the shore, in a northerly direction to a point opposite Death's Door channel (or Porte des Morts); thence through that channel into Lake Michigan. The channel claimed by Wisconsin, after leaving the mouth of the Menominee, turns to the north and pursues a northerly direction to a point opposite the Rock Island passage, which lies between Rock Island and St. Martin's Island; thence through the Rock Island passage into Lake Michigan. The territory in dispute lies between these rival channels, and embraces two groups of islands: (1) Chambers Island, the Strawberry Islands, and a few others, small and unnamed, all within the main waters of Green Bay west of the Door county peninsula; and (2) Rock, Washington, Detroit, and Plum Islands, lying between Death's Door channel and the Rock Island passage, at the north end of the peninsula. The evidence as to which of the two ship channels was the usual one at the time of the adoption of the Michigan Enabling Act is not only conflicting, but of such inconclusive character that, standing alone, we could base no decree upon it with any feeling of certainty. Living witnesses are no longer available; and tradition, recollection of statements made by persons long since dead, if of any legitimate value, deductions drawn from ancient documents, more or less cryptic, and inferences based on more recent uses of the channels, or on their relative safety and convenience as indicated by physical characteristics, all relied upon in the absence of first-hand evidence, constitute at best most unsatisfactory substitutes. If it were necessary, we should, of course, undertake the task-as we should be bound to do-of reaching a conclusion from these dubious premises. But it is not necessary, for, as in the case of the two sections of the boundary just discussed, the title of Wisconsin to the disputed area now in question is established by long possession and acquiescence, and this conclusion is justified by evidence and concessions of the most substantial character.
44
45
There is evidence of acts of dominion and possession of some of the disputed islands while Wisconsin was yet a territory. Almost from the day of her admission, the state has continuously possessed, asserted title, and exercised jurisdiction and dominion over all of the islands within the boundary claimed by her. In support of this general statement, the following, among other things, may be cited: On March 21, 1855, Washington, Detroit, Rock, and Plum Islands, described as being in the waters of Green Bay in Door county, were organized by an act of the Wisconsin Legislature as the town of Washington. Chapter Priv. & Loc. Laws Wis. A census taken the same year by the town clerk showed a population of which has since grown, it is said, to about Since before that time the United States Land Department, by its surveys, plats, and sales of public lands, has uniformly and notoriously recognized the islands as a part of Wisconsin, without objection on the part of Michigan. Indeed, as early as they were surveyed and platted as a part of Wisconsin territory. A large number of maps, published and available to the public during the years between without exception, show the islands as a part of Wisconsin, and during the same time they do not appear in any survey or upon any map as belonging to Michigan. Never, so far as we are able to find from the record, have they been recognized in any pratical way as a part of Michigan, or prior to the commencement of this suit, claimed by that state.
45
46
The evidence in respect of the other group of islands, while perhaps not so complete, is definite and clear to the same effect. The taxation of lands on Chambers Island began while Wisconsin was still a territory. In voters on that island participated in a Wisconsin election. A history of Door county, introduced by complainant, recites that the island constituted an organized town forming a part of Door county, Wis., as early as Evidence of early and continued recognition and treatment of the island as a part of Wisconsin by the United States through its surveys, etc., is to the same effect as that in respect of the other group. And the evidence is likewise the same in respect of the uniform appearance of Chambers Island and the other small islands of the group upon the old maps as a part of Wisconsin, and their absence from Michigan surveys and maps. The absence of evidence of specific acts of dominion over the strawberries and the other small islands of this group is easily understood and does not affect the result. They are of little consequence, lying well within the boundary as claimed by Wisconsin, easterly from Chambers Island and near the westerly shore of the Door county peninsula. They appear on all maps as, and have never been regarded or treated otherwise than, a part of Door county. It is impossible to give them a status differing from that of the larger island and the peninsula, between, and within the shadows of, which they lie.
46
47
That Wiconsin since statehood has continuously asserted title and has exercised complete and exclusive dominion over all the islands of both groups is really not a serious issue. Indeed, the bill of complaint avers that Wisconsin has possessed herself of, and exercised sovereignty over, the islands, including Washington, Plum, the Strawberries, and numerous other valuable islands, and has excluded and continues to exclude the state of Michigan from her rights thereto, and, more particularly that 'Wisconsin has for many years disregarded the true and rightful boundary, * * * and has for a long time past possessed and does now possess, and has asserted and does now assert, civil, criminal, and political jurisdiction over those portions of the territory within the Michigan boundaries above described as the Montreal river section, the Menominee river section, and Green Bay section of the disputed territory, aggregating approximately acres, * * * and has unlawfully taxed and still continues to unlawfully tax said property. * * *' The explanation relied upon is that the state of Michigan, as a result of her excusable ignorance, has not been aware of the real facts, and therefore should not be held to have lost rights by long acquiescence which she otherwise might have had. This view cannot be accepted, and may be dismissed, with a reference to what we have already said as to the same defense in respect of the Montreal river section.
47
48
In respect of the controversy as a whole, and each of the three sections, the words of this court is Indiana v. Kentucky, supra, are singularly apposite and conclusive:
48
49
'* * * It was over 70 years after Indiana became a state before this suit was commenced, and during all this period she never asserted any claim by legal proceedings to the tract in question. She states in her bill that all the time since her admission Kentucky has claimed the Green River Island to be within her limits, and has asserted and exercised jurisdiction over it, and thus excluded Indiana therefrom, in defiance of her authority and contrary to her rights. Why, then, did she delay to assert by proper proceedings her claim to the premises? On the day she became a state her right to Green River Island, if she ever had any, was as perfect and complete as it ever could be. On that day, according to the allegations of her bill of complaint, Kentucky was claiming and exercising, and has done so ever since, the rights of sovereignty both as to soil and jurisdiction over the land. On that day, and for many years afterwards, as justly and forcibly observed by counsel, there were perhaps scores of living witnesses whose testimony would have settled, to the exclusion of a reasonable doubt, the pivotal fact upon which the rights of the two states now hinge and yet she waited for over 70 years before asserting any claim whatever to the island, and during all those years she never exercised or attempted to exercise a single right of sovereignty or ownership over its soil. It is not shown, as he adds, that an officer of hers executed any process, civil or criminal, within it, or that a citizen residing upon it was a voter at her polls, or a juror in her courts, or that a deed to any of its lands is to be found on her records, or that any taxes were collected from desidents upon it for her revenues.
49
50
'This long acquiescence in the exercise by Kentucky of dominion and jurisdiction over the island is more potential than the recollections of all the witnesses produced on either side. Such acquiescence in the assertion of authority by the state of Kentucky, such omission to take any steps to assert her present claim by the state of Indiana, can only be regarded as a recognition of the right of Kentucky too plain to be overcome, except by the clearest and most unquestioned proof. It is a principle of public law, universally recognized, that long acquiescence in the possession of territory, and in the exercise of dominion and sovereignty over it, is conclusive of the nation's title and rightful authority.'
50
51
The result is that complainant has failed to maintain her case in any particular, and that the claims of Wisconsin as to the location of the boundary in each of the three sections are sustained.
51
52
The decree, therefore, will be for Wisconsin, costs to be divided between the parties in accordance with the general rule in cases of this character. North Dakota v. Minnesota, The boundary seems to be sufficiently defined for all purposes of future possession and jurisdiction; but the parties, or either of them, if so advised, may within 30 days submit the form of a decree more particularly to carry this opinion into effect, failing which a simple decree dismissing the bill will be entered.
52
53
It is so ordered.

UNITED STATES
v.
COHN.
Submitted Jan. 13, 1926.
1
Cohn, the defendant in error, was indicted in the District Court for a violation of section 35 of the Penal Code, as amended by the Act of October (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. This entire section is set forth in the margin.1
1
2
The indictment was dismissed, on demurrer, upon the ground that the statute did not make the matters charged a crime against the United States.2 This writ of error was then allowed by the District Judge under the provision of the Criminal Appeals Act,3 permitting the United States a direct writ of error from a judgment sustaining a demurrer to an indictment, based upon the construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded. United States v. Patten, L. Ed. 
2
3
The statute provides, inter alia, that: Whoever 'for the purpose of obtaining or aiding to obtain the payment or approval of' any 'claim upon or against the government of the United States, or any department or officer thereof, or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder,' or 'for the purpose and with the intent of cheating and swindling or defrauding the Government of the United States, or any department thereof,' or any such corporation, 'shall knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal or cover up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or make or cause to be made any false or fraudulent statements or representations, or make or use or cause to be made or used any false bill, receipt, voucher,' etc., shall be punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both.
3
4
The indictment charged that Cohn, for the purpose of obtaining the approval of a claim against the Government and the Treasury Department to the possession of imported merchandise, and for the purpose and with the intent of defrauding the Government and the Treasury Department through a perversion and obstruction of the customhouse function and of the proper and orderly administration of the laws of the United States and the regulations of the Department, had concealed and covered up material facts by a trick, scheme or device, and had knowingly caused false and fraudulent statements to be made, as follows:
4
5
In October, 1920, a certain lot of cigars arrived at Chicago from the Philippine Islands for entry at the customhouse, and came into the possession of the collector of customs. They were consigned to order 'notify Cohn Bros. Cigar Co.,' the name under which Cohn conducted his business. The next day a Chicago Bank received from a Philippine Bank a bill of lading covering the cigars, indorsed in blank by the consignor, with an attached draft drawn by the conignor upon the Cigar Co., and instructions to deliver the bill of lading only upon payment of the draft. Two days later, the draft not having been paid, Cohn, knowing these facts, fraudulently procured certain customhouse brokers to make entry of the cigars and obtain possession of them from the collector by giving a bond for the production of the bill of lading. The possession of the cigars was thus secured by Cohn upon false and fraudulent statements and representations made by him to the brokers, and through them, as his innocent agents, to the collector, that the bill of lading had not arrived in Chicago and that he was entitled to the entry and possession of the cigars, and the fraudulent concealment by him from the brokers and the collector of the material facts that the bill of lading and attached draft had arrived in Chicago, with the condition stated, and that the draft had not then been paid; thereby inducing the collector to deliver the possession of the cigars, when he 'would and should have refused so to do' if he had known these facts and that Cohn consequently had no right to make the entry or obtain possession of the cigars.
5
6
While the cigars were admissible into the United States free of duty, the Customs Regulations nevertheless required that they should be entered at the customhouse, Arts. The Regulations also provided that a bill of lading was necessary to establish the right to make the entry, Art. that merchandise consigned to order should be deemed the property of the holder of a bill of lading indorsed by the consignor, Art. 4 that such holder might make the entry, Art. and, further, that the collector might in his discretion permit entry to be made without the production of the bill of lading, on a bond conditioned for its subsequent production and indemnifying him against any loss or damage which might be sustained by reason of such permission. Customs Regulations of .
6
7
We may assume, without deciding, that under these Regulations Cohn was not entitled to enter and obtain possession of the cigars until he had paid the draft and become the holder of the bill of lading. But even so, the acts by which the possession of the cigars were obtained did not constitute an offense against the United States unless done for one or other of the purposes entering into the statutory definition of the offense and charged in the indictment, that is, either for the purpose of obtaining the approval of a 'claim upon or against' the Government or for the purpose of 'defrauding' the Government. It is contended by the United States that, although the cigars were duty free, the facts alleged in the indictment show that their possession was wrongfully obtained for both of these purposes. We cannot sustain this contention in either of its aspects.
7
8
Obtaining the possession of non-dutiable merchandise from a collector is not obtaining the approval of a 'claim upon or against' the Government, within the meaning of the statute. While the word 'claim' may sometimes be used in the broad juridical sense of 'a demand of some matter as of right, made by one person upon another, to do or to forbear to do some act or thing as a matter of duty,' Prigg v. Pennsylvania, it is clear, in the light of the entire context, that in the present statute, the provision relating to the payment or approval of a 'claim upon or against' the Government relates solely to the payment or approval of a claim for money or property to which a right is asserted against the Government, based upon the Government's own liability to the claimant. And obviously it does not include an application for the entry and delivery of non-dutiable merchandise, as to which no claim is asserted against the Government, to which the Government makes no claim, and which is merely in the temporary possession of an agent of the Government for delivery to the person who may be entitled to its possession. This is not the assertion of a 'claim upon or against' the Government, within the meaning of the statute; and the delivery of the possession is not the 'approval' of such a claim.
8
9
Neither is the wrongful obtaining of possession of such non-dutiable merchandise a 'defrauding' of the Government within the meaning of the statute. It is contended by the United States that, by analogy to the decisions in Haas v. Henkel, L. Ed. and Hammerschmidt v. United States, L. Ed. 968, and other cases involving the construction of section 37 of the Penal Code (Comp. St. § , relating to conspiracies to defraud the United States, the word 'defrauding' in the present statute should be construed as being used not merely in its primary sense of cheating the Government out of property or money, but also in the secondary sense of interfering with or obstructing one of its lawful governmental functions by deceitful and fraudulent means. The language of the two statutes is, however, so essentially different as to destroy the weight of the supposed analogy. Section 37, by its specific terms, extends broadly to every conspiracy to defraud the United States in any manner and for any purpose,' with no words of limitation whatsoever, and no limitation that can be implied from the context. Section 35, on the other hand, has no words extending the meaning of the word 'defrauding' beyond its usual and primary sense. On the contrary it is used in connection with the words 'cheating or swindling,' indicating that it is to be construed in the manner in which those words are ordinarily used, as relating to the fraudulent causing of pecuniary or property loss. And this meaning is emphasized by other provisions of the section in which the word 'defraud' is used in reference to the obtaining of money or other property from the Government by false claims, vouchers and the like; and by the context of the entire section, which deals with the wrongful obtaining of money and other property of the Government, with no reference to the impairment or obstruction of its government functions.
9
10
We hence conclude that the indictment did not show, within the meaning of section 35 of the Penal Code, either the purpose of obtaining the approval of a 'claim upon for against' the United States and the Treasury Department, or the purpose and intent of 'defrauding' them. The demurrer was rightly sustained; and the judgment of the District Court is

CHAMBERLAIN MACH. WORKS
v.
UNITED STATES.
Argued Jan. 12 and 13, 1926.
1
The Chamberlain Machine Works filed its petition in the Court of Claims to recover compensation for the partial performance of a war contract for the machining of steel shells, which had been canceled by the United States before completion, pursuant to the terms of the contract. The petition was dismissed on demurrer, without opinion. The appeal was allowed in June, 1924.
1
2
The petition and an exhibit thereto disclosed that the claim was originally prosecuted in the War Department under the Dent Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. e), in various proceedings before the Ordinance Section of the Claims Board, the Board of Contract Adjustment,1 and the Appeal Section of the Claims Board,2 and that the Secretary of War made an award to the petitioner of $ 'in full adjustment, payment, and discharge' of the contract, which was accepted by the petitioner, in writing, in 'full satisfaction of any and all claims or demands' which it had or might have pertaining to, growing out of, or incident to the contract.
2
3
The petition sought to recover on the original contract, despite the settlement made more than three years before. It alleged, broadly, that this settlement was iniquitous and unjust, and not the voluntary act of the petitioner, but was secured by 'fraud' of the officers of the War Department in the handling of the claim, by 'continued brow-beating,' and by 'coercion' through which they 'literally forced' the petitioner to take the sum offered.
3
4
The general allegations of 'fraud' and 'coercion' were mere conclusions of the pleader, and were not admitted by the demurrer. Fogg v. Blair, L. Ed. 104. To show a cause of action it was necessary that the petition state distinctly the particular acts of fraud and coercion relied on, specifying by whom and in what manner they were perpetrated, with such definiteness and reasonable certainty that the court might see that, if proved, they would warrant the setting aside of the settlement. See Stearns v. Page, L. Ed. Perkins-Campbell Co. v. United States, L. Ed. 643; Cairo Railroad v. United States, L. Ed. 651. The petition contained no such specific allegations, and since its vague and general averments did not overcome the effect of the release, the demurrer was properly sustained. See St. Louis Railroad v. United States, L. Ed. 649.

FLEISCHMANN CONST. CO. et al.
v.
UNITED STATES, to Use of FORSBERG et al.
Argued Oct. 15, 1925.
1
This is a suit under the Materialmen's Act of as amended by the Act of It was brought in the name of the United States by Forsberg a materialman, as use plaintiff, in the federal district court for Eastern Virginia, to recover on a bond given by the Fleischmann Construction Company, as contractor, and the National Surety Company, as surety, for the construction, under a contract with the United States, of a torpedo assembly plant in Alexandria. Various materialmen and subcontractors filed intervening petitions in the suit. The plaintiff and the intervenors recovered judgment, which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, This writ of error was allowed in March, 1924. A motion was interposed to dismiss the writ of error upon the ground that the record presents no question properly reviewable by this Court, or to affirm the judgment; the consideration of which was postponed to the hearing on the merits.

The Materialmen's Act, as amended,1 provides that the usual penal bond required of any one entering into a contract with the United States for the construction of any public work, shall contain an additional obligation for the payment by the contractor of all persons supplying labor and materials in the prosecution of the work. Any such person not thus paid may intervene in any action instituted by the United States on the bond and obtain judgment pro rata with other intervenors, subject to the priority of the claim of the United States. If no suit is brought by the United States 'within six months from the completion and final settlement' of the contract, any such person shall have a right of action upon the bond, and may, 'within one year after the performance and final settlement' of the contract, but not later, commence suit against the contractor and his sureties, in the name of the United States, for his use and benefit, in the federal court of the district in which the contract was performed, and prosecute the same to final judgment and execution. Where suit 'is so instituted by a creditor or by creditors, only one action shall be brought, and any creditor may file his claim in such action and be made party thereto within one year from the completion of the work under said contract, and not later.' If the recovery on the bond is inadequate to pay the amounts due to all of the creditors, judgment shall be given to each pro rata.
2
3
The first question to be determined is whether any of the matters presented by the assignment of errors-which relate chiefly to the times at which the suit was brought and the intervening petitions filed-are now open to review upon the record.
3
4
Shortly outlined, the proceedings in the case were these: The suit was brought by Forsberg on April 6, 1921. The declaration alleged that the Construction Company entered into a contract with the United States for the construction of the plant and gave bond to secure its performance, in October, 1918; and that this contract 'was completed and final settlement had on' September 25, 1920, 'more than six months and within one year before' the filing of the suit. The intervening petitions, which were filed between June 15 and September 24, 1921, contained substantially the same general averments as the declaration, and alleged further that they were filed 'before the expiration of one year after the completion' of the contract. In December, 1921, the plaintiff, by leave of court, amended the declaration so as to allege that the original contract had been amended by a supplemental contract in May, 1919, and the defendants had thereafter executed an additional bond; and that the contract as amended 'was completed and final settlement had' on September 25, 1920. The intervening petitions were likewise amended so as to incorporate substantially these same averments, and allege further that the petitions were filed 'before the expiration of one year after the completion of said original contract as amended.'
4
5
The defendants filed demurrers to the original and amended declaration and petitions. All of these were overruled. And the amended declaration and petitions were then put at issue under pleas filed by the defendants.
5
6
By agreement of all the parties the case was referred to a special master to hear the evidence and find the facts. In his report, he found that the work was completed February 5, 1920, and that the date of final settlement was October 1, 1920.
6
7
Thereafter, in April, 1923, before action had been taken on this report, the parties filed a written stipulation, under section of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St. § , waiving a jury and agreeing that all the issues might be tried and determined by the court.
7
8
In August, the District Judge handed down an extended written opinion in which he considered the entire case as to the facts and law, and concluded, inter alia, that the master had found correctly that the date of the final settlement was October 1, 1920; that it was unnecessary to determine the date on which the work had been completed, since the intervenors had filed their petitions within one year after the final settlement; that the actions were not barred because the amendments setting up the supplemental contract were made more than a year after the final settlement, the original and supplemental contracts being one and the same, and the amendments relating back to the bringing of the original suit and the filing of the original petition; and that the claims of the plaintiff and the intervenors were severally established. No special findings of fact had been requested; and none were made.
8
9
On the same day a judgment was entered, which 'for reasons stated' in the opinion, awarded the plaintiff and the intervenors recoveries upon their several claims, the aggregate of which was less than the amount of either bond.
9
10
The defendants, without having excepted to any of the rulings or conclusions of the court or requested any special findings of fact, sued out, in September, a writ of error from the Circuit Court of Appeals. After this writ had issued, however, the District Judge, in October, granted them a 'bill of exceptions,' which recited that the court had filed its opinion and entered its final judgment on the same day, without notice to the parties; set for the various exceptions then, for the first time, noted by the defendants 'to the rulings, finding of fact and conclusions of law by the court' in the opinion and judgment; and stated that, by reason of the circumstances, these exceptions were 'to be taken as severally made at the time thereof and before the entry of judgment thereon.' And later the District Judge granted them another 'bill of exceptions,' embodying the evidence and the proceedings before the master, and setting forth in the same manner other exceptions to be taken, for like reason, as made before the entry of the judgment.
10
11
The Circuit Court of Appeals disposed of the case in a per curiam opinion stating that, while there was a serious question whether there was anything before it because of the want of due exceptions, it preferred to rest the affirmance of the judgment on the merits, as it thought the District Court was clearly right on all the points decided.
11
 The assignment of error challenges the affirmance of the judgment because of the action of the District Court in overruling the demurrers to the original and amended declaration and petitions; in allowing the amendments to the original declaration and petitions; and in making various other 'holdings' and 'findings' in reference to matters of law and fact. It is clear that none of these questions are open to review except those which arise upon the pleadings.
12
13
Section of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St. s -re-enacting a like provision in the Act of March provides that when an issue of fact in a civil cause is tried and determined by the court without the intervention of a jury, according to section 'the rulings of the court in the progress of the trial of the cause, if excepted to at the time, and duly presented by a bill of exceptions, may be reviewed' upon writ of error; 'and when the finding is special the review may extend to the determination of the sufficiency of the facts found to support the judgment.'
13
14
The opinion of the trial judge, dealing generally with the issues of law and fact and giving the reasons for his conclusion, is not a special finding of facts within the meaning of the statute. Insurance Co. v. Tweed, Dickinson v. Planters' Bank, L. Ed. 278; Raimond v. Terrebonne Parish, British Mining Co. v. Baker Mining Co., York v. Washburn, United States v. Stockyards Co., And it is settled by repeated decisions, that in the absence of special findings, the general finding of the court is conclusive upon all matters of fact, and prevents any inquiry into the conclusions of law embodied therein, except in so far as the rulings during the progress of the trial were excepted to and duly preserved by bill of exceptions, as required by the statute. Norris v. Jackson, Miller v. Insurance Co., L. Ed. 398; Dickinson v. Planters' Bank, supra, Insurance Co. v. Folson, L. Ed. 827; Cooper v. Omohundro, L. Ed. 47; Insurance Co. v. Sea, L. Ed. 511; Martinton v. Fairbanks, L. Ed. 862; Boardman v. Toffey, L. Ed. 898; British Mining Co. v. Baker Mining Co., supra; Lehnen v. Dickson, L. Ed. 373; St. Louis v. Telegraph Co., L. Ed. 1044; Vicksburg Ry. v. Anderson-Tully Co., L. Ed. 1020; Law v. United States, L. Ed. 401; Humphreys v. Third National Bank, United States v. Stockyards Co., supra, To obtain a review by an appellate court of the conclusions of law a party must either obtain from the trial court special findings which raise the legal propositions, or present the propositions of law to the court and obtain a ruling on them. Norris v. Jackson, supra, Martinton v. Fairbanks, supra. That is, as was said in Humphreys v. Third National Bank, supra, 'he should request special findings of fact by the court, framed like a special verdict of a jury, and then reserve his exceptions to those special findings, if he deems them not to be sustained by any evidence; and if he wishes to except to the conclusions of law drawn by the court from the facts found he should have them separately stated and excepted to. In this way, and in this way only, is it possible for him to review completely the action of the court below upon the merits.'
14
15
These rules necessarily exclude from our consideration all the questions presented by the assignment of errors except those arising on the pleadings. All the others relate either to matters of fact or to conclusions of law embodied in the general finding. These are not open to review, as there were no special findings of fact and no exceptions to the rulings on matters of law were taken during the progress of the trial or duly preserved by a bill of exceptions. The defendants offered no exceptions to the rulings of the court until after the writ of error had issued, transferring jurisdiction of the case to the Court of Appeals. And the recitals in the subsequent 'bills of exceptions' that the exceptions, then for the first time presented, were to be taken as made before the entry of the judgment, are nugatory. A bill of exceptions is not valid as to any matter which was not excepted to at the trial. Walton v. United States, L. Ed. 182; Insurance Co. v. Boon, And it cannot incorporate into the record nunc pro tunc as of the time when an exception should have been taken, one which in fact was not then taken. Walton v. United States, supra, Turner v. Yates. 
15
16
The statute however, relates only to those rulings of law which are made in the course of the trial, and by its terms has no application to the preliminary rulings of the District Judge made, in the exercise of his general authority, before the issues are submitted to him for hearing under the statutory stipulation. Such rulings on the pleadings and the sufficiency of the complaint are therefore subject to review as in any other case, independently of the statute. Norris v. Jackson, supra, Martinton v. Fairbanks, supra; Lehnen v. Dickson, supra; St. Louis v. Telegraph Co., supra; Vicksburg Railway v. Anderson-Tully Co., supra. And see Campbell v. Boyreau, Bond v. Dustin, L. Ed. 835; Erkel v. United States, and Ladd Bank v. Hicks Co., as to the questions which are open to review where the case is heard by the judge by consent, but without the jurisdictional stipulation.
16
17
Since, therefore, the questions arising on the pleadings in this case are now open to review, the motion to dismiss the writ of error must be denied.
17
 This brings us to the consideration of the questions arising on the pleadings as to which errors are assigned. We may assume for present purposes, without deciding, that the defendants did not waive their demurrers by pleading over to the merits after they had been overruled. Compare, however, Young v. Martin, Stanton v. Embrey, Teal v. Walker, L. Ed. 415; Bauserman v. Blunt, L. Ed. 316; Nalle v. Oyster, Denver v. Home Savings Bank, L. Ed. 485; Harper v. Cunningham. 
18
19
The demurrers to the original declaration and petitions were based upon the grounds that they were insufficient in law, since the averment in the declaration that the contract was completed and final settlement had on September 25, 1920, was a mere conclusion of law, and the facts averred did not show that a right of action had accrued or that the court had jurisdiction of the cause when the suit was instituted. And the demurrers to the amended declaration and petitions were based on like grounds, and on the further ground that they set up new causes of action and were not filed within the times required by the Materialmen's Act.
19
20
These demurrers were rightly overruled. The averments in the declaration, as originally filed and as amended, that the contract between the Construction Company and the United States was completed and finally settled on September 25, 1920, were not mere conclusions of law, but specific averments of an ultimate fact, appropriately pleaded. And since, as appeared from the record, the original suit was brought on April 6, 1921, they showed upon their face that it was instituted more than six months and 'within one year after the performance and final settlement' of the contract, as required by the Act; thereby tendering an issue of fact as to the date of the final settlement which was conclusively determined against the defendants by the general finding of the court.
20
21
And although the amended declaration and petitions showing the supplemental contract between the Construction Company and the United States, were filed more than one year after the date of the final settlement, they did not set up new causes of action at a time beyond that permitted by the Act. The original declaration set forth a provision in the original bond that it was given to secure the performance of the contract 'as it now exists or may be modified according to its terms.' And the supplemental contract-a copy of which was attached to and made a part of the amended declaration-specifically provided that it should be regarded as amendatory of the original contract; that all provisions and requirements of the original contract should remain in full force, except as specifically changed; and that the original bond should not be released or otherwise affected, but should remain in full force as though the changes provided for had been included in the original contract; and it expressly recited that the Surety Company, which also signed the supplemental contract, was made a party thereto 'for the purpose of extending the obligation of said bond to cover the changes herein provided.' It is clear that the amended declaration and petitions did not set up new causes of action, but merely supplmented by appropriate allegations the defective statements of the rights which had existed when the original declaration and petitions were filed; and that the amendments when made related back, by operation of law, to the dates on which the original suit was brought and the original petitions filed. Texas Cement Co. v. McCord, L. Ed. 893; Illinois Surety Co. v. Peeler, L. Ed. 609.
21
22
Furthermore, it was not essential that the petitions should allege the date on which the work was completed, in order to show that the intervenors' rights of action had accrued when the claims were filed. It is urged that while the Act permits the original suit to be brought 'within one year after the performance and final settlement' of the contract, it requires intervening creditors to file their claims in such action 'within one year from the completion of the work' under the contract. It is obvious that if this latter provision is to be taken literally, the time allowed intervening creditors in which to file their claims would expire earlier than the time allowed for bringing the original suit, since such suit might be instituted within one year after the final settlement, but other creditors could only intervene within one year after the completion of the work, a period necessarily terminating within less than a year after the final settlement.
22
23
The strict letter of an act must, however, yield to its evident spirit and purpose, when this is necessary to give effect to the intent of Congress. Holy Trinity Church v. United States, L. Ed. 226; Ozawa v. United States, And unjust or absurd consequences are, if possible, to be avoided. Lau Ow Bew v. United States, L. Ed. 340; Hawaii v. Mankichi. 
23
24
The purpose of the Materialmen's Act, which is highly remedial and must be construed liberally, is to provide security for the payment of all persons who supply labor or material in a public work, that is, to give all creditors a remedy on the bond of the contractor, to be enforced within a reasonable time in a single proceeding in which all claimants shall unite. Bryant Co. v. Steam Fitting Co., L. Ed 253; Illinois Surety Co. v. Davis, L. Ed. 1206. In resolving the ambiguities in its provisions the court must endeavor to give coherence to them in order to accomplish the intention of Congress, and adapt them to fulfill its whole purpose. Bryant Co. v. Steam Fitting Co., supra. In this case it was further stated, as the premise on which the court rested the solution of the particular ambiguity there involved, that the Act 'imposes a limitation of time on all claimants, * * * beginning to run from the same event,' that is, the performance and final settlement of the contract; and that, just as the creditor who institutes the original suit has one year from the final settlement in which to commence the action, other creditors must file their claims 'within the same limit of time.' A like construction of the Act was also adopted in Pederson v United States, and London Indemnity Co. v. Smoot, App. D. C. And this we now confirm.
24
25
By the terms of the Act no creditor can institute a suit until after six months from the completion and final settlement of the contract, within which period the United States alone has the right to commence an action. Texas Cement Co. v. McCord, supra; Miller v. Bonding Co., And if a suit is then instituted by a creditor or creditors, 'only one action shall be brought,' and all shall file their claims in that suit. If therefore, the provision limiting the right of other creditors to file their claims to twelve months after the completion of the work, is to be taken literally, the result would be that where, for any reason, the final settlement of the contract between the United States and the contractor is delayed until more than six months after the completion of the work, as may frequently happen, the only creditors who could recover on the contractor's bond would be those who should succeed in first commencing a suit after the expiration of the six months from the final settlement, since more than a year having then elapsed after the completion of the work, other creditors would be debarred from any recovery whatever, either in the suit thus brought or in any independent action. In such case the bond would be appropriated solely to the payment of the debts due the creditors who instituted the suit; and to the extent of any surplus the contractor and his surety would be entirely released from liability.
25
26
It is clear, considering the entire provisions of the Act, that such an anomalous and unreasonable result was not intended, frustrating the plain purpose that the bond should inure to the benefit of all creditors and that all should share pro rata in the recovery. And to give effect to the manifest intention of Congress it must be held that the phrase 'within one year from the completion of the work' was used in reference to the filing of intervening claims in the same sense as the phrase 'within one year after the performance and final settlement of the contract' in reference to the commencement of the original suit; that is to say, not only that the original suit may be commenced within one year after the performance and final settlement of the contract but that other creditors may file their claims in such suit within the same period of time. In other words, as was said in the Bryant Co. Case, there is the same limit of time for the commencement of the suit and for the filing of intervening claims, 'beginning to run from the same event,' namely, the performance and final settlement of the contract; thereby avoiding a race of diligence between creditors and bringing about the equality in the distribution of the avails of the bond among all creditors which Congress obviously intended.
26
 We find no error in the allowance of the amendments to the declaration and petitions, setting up the supplemental contract. Aside from the fact that the defendants did not object to the allowance of these amendments or except to the orders of the court permitting them to be made, they were plainly germane to the causes of action originally alleged; and, as already stated, did not bring in any new causes of action. Their allowance was entirely proper. Illinois Surety Co. v. Peeler, supra. 
27
 It is also contended that the judgment of the District Court is void for the reason that it is recited in one of the 'bills of exceptions' and in a memorandum subsequently filed by the District Judge, that the case was heard and taken under advisement in April, while the opinion was filed and the judgment entered in August, that is, after the commencement of a new term of court. There was no exception to the judgment on this ground, and no assignment of error in reference to this matter. And even if the statements thus made by the District Judge after the writ of error had issued, could be looked to for the purpose of contradicting a specific recital in the judgment that it was entered on the same day on which the case was heard and argued, the contention is in conflict with the long established practice and immemorial usage of the federal courts in this respect, and entirely wanting in merit.

SEABOARD RICE MILLING CO.
v.
CHICAGO, R. I. & P. RY. CO.
270 U.S. 367
GENERAL AMERICAN TANK CAR CORPORATION et al.
v.
DAY, Sheriff, etc.
Argued January 21, 1926.
1
Appellants brought suit in the United States District Court for Eastern Louisiana to enjoin the appellee from collecting, by seizure of appellants' property, a tax assessed against them by the state of Louisiana. From a judgment dismissing the bill the case comes here on direct appeal by reason of the constitutional questions involved. Judicial Code, § , before amendment of Hays v. Port of Seattle, Arkadelphia Milling Co. v. St. Louis & S. W. Ry. Co.. 
1
2
The tax in question was imposed under section of the Louisiana Laws of Section 1 of that act imposes a tax, for state purposes, of 5 1/4 mills on the dollar on all property within the state. Section 5 authorizes the assessment of an additional tax for state purposes of 25 mills on the dollar 'of the assessed value of all rolling stock of nonresident * * * corporations, having no domicile in the state of Louisiana, operated over any railroad in the state of Louisiana within or during any year for which such tax is levied. * * *' Article 10, s 16, of the Louisiana Constitution, exempts from all local taxation nonresidents paying the 25-mill tax. Appellants do not complain of the 5 1/4-mill tax assessed against them under section 1; nor do they question the amount or method of computation of the 25-mill tax assessed under section 5; but they object to it on the ground that it violates the Constitution of Louisiana, which requires that 'all taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects' (article 10, § 1), and on the ground that, as applied to appellants, it violates the federal Constitution by imposing a burden on interstate commerce, and denies to appellants the equal protection of the laws, in that it discriminates unreasonably between residents of Louisiana or nonresidents domiciled within the state, and nonresidents not so domiciled and engaged in interstate commerce.
2
3
All the appellants are corporations organized in states other than Louisiana and are not domiciled or licensed to do business in that state. All own and operate within the state tank cars, for the transportation of oil, which are used in interstate commerce. Taxes on property within the state of Louisiana, other than state taxes, are assessed where the taxpayer is domiciled, by the several parishes and by municipalities in the parishes, both of which are political subdivisions of the state. In some parishes, local taxes exceed 25 mills, and in others they are less than that amount; but it is asserted by the appellee that the average of all local property taxes is approximately 25 mills.
3
4
The tax in question is authorized by article 10, § 16, of the Louisiana Constitution, which reads as follows:
4
5
'Sec. 16. Rolling stock operated in this state, the owners of which have no domicile therein, shall be assessed by the Louisiana tax commission, and shall be taxed for state purposes only, at a rate not to exceed forty mills on the dollar of assessed value.'
5
6
The constitutionality of the 25-mill tax imposed under this section was upheld by the Supreme Court of Louisiana in Union Tank Car Co. v. Day, and that case disposes of the objections urged here to the validity of the tax under the state Constitution.
6
7
It is argued that the 25-mill tax which was imposed on tank cars belonging to the several appellants is a thinly disguised attempt to compel nonresidents doing interstate business in Louisiana to declare a domicile in the state, and that it is therefore an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, within the principle of those cases holding that a state may not require a nonresident to procure a license to do business or to declare a domicile within the state as a condition to engaging in commerce across its boundaries. International Text-Book Co. v. Pigg, L. R. A. (N. S.) Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, But it is obvious, from an inspection of the statute, that the tax in question is imposed on property of nonresidents in lieu of the local tax assessed in the several parishes of the state on property of persons or corporations domiciled there, and that the nonresident may either pay the state tax assessed under section 5 or, at his option, by becoming domiciled in a parish, pay instead of it the local taxes assessed within the parish. The effect of section 5 is not to require the nonresident corporation to take out a license to do business within the state, but only to subject its property within the state to state taxation. There being no question as to the amount of the tax or the method of its computation, the taxation of appellants' property within the state can be open to no objection, unless it operates to discriminate in some substantial way between the property of the appellants and the property of residents or domiciled nonresidents. Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, And see Pullman Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, L. Ed. 613.
7
8
We are not concerned with the particular method adopted by Louisiana of allocating the tax between the state and its political subdivisions. That is a matter within the competency of the state Legislature. Columbus Southern Ry. Co. v. Wright. 
8
9
The court below found, as did the state Supreme Court in Union Tank Car Co. v. Day, supra, that all local taxes throughout the state, from which appellants are exempted by the Louisiana Constitution, average approximately 25 mills, and that, since the tax assessed under section 5 was substantially the equivalent of the local tax in lieu of which it was assessed, there was no unjust discrimination. Such a classification is not necessarily discriminatory. Travelers' Insurance Co. v. Connecticut, Where the taxing statute, which is in lieu of a local tax assessed on residents, discloses no purpose to discriminate against nonresident taxpayers, and in substance does not do so, it is not invalid merely because equality in its operation as compared with local taxation has not been attained with mathematical exactness. In determining whether there is a denial of equal protection of the laws by such taxation, we must look to the failure and reasonableness of its purposes and practical operation, rather than to minute differences between its application in practice and the application we must look to the fairness and reasonableness which it is complementary. Travelers' Insurance Co. v. Connecticut, supra. And see State Railroad Tax Cases, Shaffer v. Carter, L. Ed. 445.
9
10
But appellants challenge the District Court's finding of fact that local taxation throughout the state will average about 25 mills. They insist that the average of local taxation is 21 mills, and that this disparity between the rate of tax assessed on appellants and the local tax on the property of residents is a substantial discrimination establishing the invalidity of the tax. In the absence of a purpose to discriminate disclosed by the legislation itself we are not prepared to say that a 4 mills variation in one year not shown to be a necessary or continuing result of the scheme of taxation adopted would be an unconstitutional discrimination; for in such a scheme of complementary tax statutes however fairly devised it would be impossible to provide in advance against occasional inequalities as great as that here complained of.
10
11
The record, however, does not support appellants' contention. It was stipulated by the parties that the total of all state and local taxes on property in some of the parishes exceeds mills, the sum of the general state tax of 5 1/4 mills and the special 25 mills tax on property of nonresidents, and that in other parishes it is less than that amount. The stipulation does not, however, show the amount of the variation in the rate of local taxation nor its average throughout the state. The only evidence on the subject is an extract from the annual report of the Louisiana tax commission, purporting to relate to taxes 'for the parishes.' From the data embodied in this report, appellants make their own calculation that the average rate of all parish and local taxes is 21 mills. It is, however, conceded that municipalities within the parishes have independent power of taxation. In some instances they are exempt from taxation by the parish (Const. La. Art. 14, § 12), and the power of parishes to tax property in incorporated cities and towns for parochial purposes is, in certain instances, limited (Const. La. art. 14, §§ 7, 8). It is contended by appellee that appellants' computation does not include in local taxes all the taxes assessed by municipalities within the parishes, except in the case of the parish of Orleans, whose limits coincide with those of the city of New Orleans, and that there the rate exceeds 31 mills, as is shown by the report of the tax commission. It is impossible to say, from an inspection of the extract from the report in evidence, which of these contentions is correct. The report is stated to cover taxes for the parishes, and includes numerous items of parish taxes, but it does not show on its face whether all taxes assessed by cities, towns, and villages within the parish are included in the report, and there is nothing in the record which will enable us to ascertain that fact. The appellant has therefore failed to show that the tax is discriminatory, either in principle or in its practical operation, and has laid no foundation for assailing its constitutionality.
11
12
The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.

Argued and Submitted Jan. 7, 8, 1926.
1
Separate suits were brought by the several appellees, in the United States District Court for South Dakota, to enjoin the county commissioners, the auditor, and the treasurer of Minnehaha county, South Dakota, from making any apportionment of benefits or assessments of costs affecting the property of the several appellees, for the construction or repair of a drainage system in the area within the county embraced in a project known as 'drainage ditch No. 1 and 2.'
1
2
In all of the suits, except No. 99, there was diversity of citizenship. In each it was alleged that an amount in excess of the jurisdictional requirement was in controversy, and in each it was alleged that proceedings purporting to be had under the South Dakota drainage statutes, with respect to the lands of the appellees, were unauthorized and void, and that those statutes and proceedings denied to appellees due process of law and the equal protection of the laws, in contravention of the Constitution of the United States. The suits were tried together and a decree was given for the plaintiffs by the District Court. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Risty, The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, on appeal, affirmed the decree (Risty v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., and the cases are brought here on appeal (Judicial Code, §§ , before Act of February 13, 1925; Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. R. Co., L. Ed. , 88). Petition for certiorari was denied.

3
The two courts below agree as to all material facts. We accordingly consider them here only so far as is needful to pass on questions of law. United States v. State Investment Co., L. Ed. 639.
3
the board of county commissioners of Minnehaha county, acting under the Constitution and laws of the state, established 'drainage ditch No. 1,' extending from a point north of the city of Sioux Falls, thence south, and then to the east of Sioux Falls, 3 miles in all, to the Big Sioux River, into which it emptied. From the main ditch, a spur ditch was extended northwest to a point near the Big Sioux River, which from that point passes to the southwest and thence flows east, forming a loop about the principal part of the city of Sioux Falls, and finally flows through the city on its easterly side in a northeasterly direction.
4
the board of county commissioners established drainage ditch No. 2, extending northerly from the north terminus of ditch No. 1 for a distance of 12 miles. The two ditches thus formed one continuous ditch, draining agricultural lands lying to the north of the city. Both ditches, and the assessment districts in connection with them, are conceded to have been lawfully established.

the river broke through its banks into the area drained by the spur ditch, and uniting with the flood water flowing from the river through ditch No. 2, flooded the main ditch, No. 1, washed out and destroyed a spillway on ditch No. 1, and in its uncontrolled flow to the river caused extensive damage. There was danger that the river by its flow through the ditch would be diverted from its natural course, cutting off the city's water supply and causing other damage to the city and to individuals.

7
In August, 1916, a proceeding was instituted by petition to the board of county commissioners, purporting to be pursuant to statute, 'to reconstruct and improve drainage ditches Nos. 1 and 2 * * * and to pay therefor by an assessment upon the property, persons and corporations benefitted.' This proceeding resulted in resolutions of the commissioners purporting to establish 'drainage district No. 1 and 2' and providing for the construction of the proposed ditch. The location fixed for it however, was identical with that of the old ditches No. 1 and No. 2. The county commissioners then caused the previously established ditch No. 1 and ditch No. 2 to be diked, cleaned out, and widened and deepened at certain points; the river to be straightened, and the spillway to be reconstructed so as to continue and safeguard the flow of water through ditch No. 1 and ditch No. 2. The cost was approximately $.
7
8
Proceedings were then had by the county commissioners for the assessment of benefits to defray the expenses thus incurred. The assessments of benefits were extended to areas not embraced in the assessment districts of ditch No. 1 and ditch No. 2, as previously established, and resulted in the assessment of benefits now complained of, made against all the appellees, some of whom did and some of whom did not own land within the area originally assessed for the establishment of ditch No. 1 and ditch No. 2. When the present suits were commenced, notice had been given to the appellees of a tentative assessment of benefits to their land, and of a proceeding to be had to equalize benefits before final assessments for the cost of construction.
8
9
Both courts below found that the drainage ditch No. 1 and 2 was not a new project, but was in fact identical with the previously established ditches No. 1 and No. 2; that no new or additional drainage was established, and that the only purpose of the proceedings was to provide for the maintenance and repair of the previously established ditches by assessing the cost on tracts not included within the area originally assessed for their construction. For these reasons, among others, both courts held that the proceedings had by the board of county commissioners to apportion and assess benefits on land outside the original drainage districts were unauthorized and void under the statutes of South Dakota. In this we think they were right.
9
of the South Dakota Revised Code of provides that the board of county commissioners 'may establish and cause to be constructed any ditch or drain; may provide for the straightening or enlargement of any water course or drain previously constructed, and may provide for the maintenance of such ditch, drain or water course. * * *'
10
provides that the powers conferred for establishing and constructing drains 'shall also extend to the include the deepening and widening of any drains which have heretofore been or may hereafter be constructed,' and that no proceedings shall be had under this section 'except upon notice and the other procedure prescribed herein for the construction of drains.'
11
12
The procedure prescribed by the South Dakota statutes embraces two distinct schemes or methods for carrying into effect the authority of the board of county commissioners. The one relates exclusively to the establishment and construction of proposed drainage; the other to assessments for further costs and maintenance of drainage already established. With reference to the establishment of proposed drainage, it is provided that the board shall act only on petition of a landowner affected by the 'proposed drainage' (section and upon the filing of the petition the board shall cause the 'proposed route' of the drainage to be inspected and, if necessary, surveyed (section . It is required to hold a hearing on notice describing the proposed drainage (section , and after hearing the drainage 'may be established' in accordance with the petition or the findings of the board (section . After the establishment of the drainage, the board is required to determine 'the proportion of benefits of the proposed drainage,' and to fix a time and place for equalization of benefits, on notice describing the land affected by the 'proposed drainage,' and to state the proportion of benefits fixed for each tract, benefits being considered 'such as accrue directly by the construction of such drainage or indirectly by virtue of such drainage being an outlet for connection drains that may be subsequently constructed.' Section Following equalization of benefits as prescribed, the board is authorized to make an assessment against each tract, 'in proportion to the benefits as equalized,' for the purpose of paying damages and the cost of establishment, which are stated to include all the expenses 'incurred or to be incurred that in any way contributed or will contribute to the establishment or construction of the drainage. All assessments are made perpetual liens upon the tracts assessed. Section .
12
13
The only provisions contained in the statutes for equalization of benefits are those found in the sections referred to, which have to do with the establishment of proposed drainage. By section all drains, when constructed, are in charge of the board of county commissioners, who are made responsible for keeping them open and in repair. The statutory provisions which deal with assessments for further costs of construction and for maintenance are found in sections the material portions of which are printed in the margin.1 It will be observed that there is no provision for the assessment or equalization of benefits in connection with the procedure provided in those sections for assessing for further costs of construction and maintenance. No such provision is required; for by the express terms of section the procedure for making assessments for the additional cost of construction is like that provided for the first assessment for construction (section after the equalization of benefits has been had under section and by section assessments for maintenance are to he made 'upon the landowners affected in the proportions determined for such drainage.' Both sections clearly contemplate that assessments for additional construction and for maintenance are to be made upon those lands which are already embraced within the drainage project, and on which the proportion of benefits has been determined by equalization proceedings had after the establishment of the original project.
13
14
The statutes of South Dakota contain no provision for assessing the cost of reconstruction or maintenance of an existing drainage project except in the two sections last referred to, and they make no provision for assessing such costs upon lands not embraced within or assessed in connection with the drainage as originally established. Whether the cost of construction work actually done on ditch No. 1 and ditch No. 2 and involved in this litigation be regarded as additional costs of construction or as cost of maintenance, or partly one and partly the other, there is no statutory authority for assessing that cost on lands not included in the original drainage district.
14
15
'If any proceeding for the location, establishment or construction of any drain * * * has been * * * voluntarily abandoned * * * for any cause, the board of county commissioners may nevertheless * * * locate a drain * * * under the same of different names and in the same or different locations from those described in the * * * abandoned proceeding under the provisions of this article.'
15
16
But the original proceedings for the establishment and construction of ditch No. 1 and ditch No. 2 were not abandoned, and the proceedings had for levying the assessments now in question were not framed or conducted on that theory. They were consequently without authority in law and could not affect the rights of appellees.
16
17
While there are expressions in the opinion in Gilseth v. Risty, decided after these suits were begun, which, standing by themselves, might be regarded as supporting the view that the proceedings now in question were authorized by the statutes of South Dakota, the court clearly rested its decision upon other grounds. It is the duty of the federal courts, in suits brought in or removed to the district courts, to decide for themselves all relevant questions of state law, and while they will follow the decisions of state courts as to the interpretation of a state statute, we do not think that the case of Gilseth v. Risty, supra, so clearly or decisively passed upon the question here involved as to control our decision. Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., Barber v. Pittsburgh, etc., Railway, L. Ed. 925. And see Edward Hines Yellow Pine Trustees v. Martin. 
17
18
As our decision in these cases turns on the construction and application of the state law, we do not pass upon the constitutional questions raised. See Bohler v. Callaway, L. Ed. 745; Chicago G. W. Ry. v. Rendall, L. Ed. 183. They are, however, questions of substance and sufficient to give the court jurisdiction to pass on the whole case. Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. R. Co., supra; Chicago G. W. Ry. v. Kendall, supra; Bohler v. Callaway, supra.
18
19
The objections to the exercise of equity jurisdiction in these cases require no extended comment. When the appellees filed their bills, the drainage project had been completed and costruction warrants had been issued for the work done; benefits apportioned to the lands of the appellee had been tentatively fixed and notice of a hearing for the equalization of benefits had been given. The steps next in order after the hearing would have been the assessment of costs of construction and the filing of copies of the assessment with the county treasurer, which would have established a lien on the property assessed. Section As the principal ground for appellees' suits was the invalidity of the whole proceeding and not merely inequality in apportionment of benefits, and as the effect of the proposed equalization would have been to bring the lands of appellees into the newly established drainage district and subject them to future assessments for construction costs and for maintendance, the threatened injury was imminent and the suits were not premature. The assessment, if made, would have established a lien on the appellees' property which would be a cloud on title-to say nothing of the fact that the effect of the pending proceeding would have been to subject their property to future assessments; hence the case was one for equitable relief unless there was a plain and adequate remedy at law. Ohio Tax Cases, Shaffer v. Carter, L. Ed. 445; Chicago, B. & Q. R. R. v. Osborne, L. Ed. 878. The remedy by appeal to the state court under section does not appear to be coextensive with the relief which equity may give. In any event, it is not one which may be availed of at law in the federal courts, and the test of equity jurisdiction in a federal court is the inadequacy of the remedy on the law side of that court and not the inadequacy of the remedies afforded by the state courts. Smyth v. Ames, Chicago, B. & Q. R. R. Co. v. Osborne, supra.
19
20
It does not appear that the state law affords a remedy by payment of the assessment and suit to recover it back, which, if it exists, can be availed of in the federal courts (Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. Benedict, L. Ed. 1288), or that such remedy, if available, would not entail a multiplicity of suits. It is not suggested that section of the state Code, which permits suits to recover taxes and forbids injunctions to restrain their collection. has any application to assessments for drainage, In Gilseth v. Risty, supra, the Supreme Court of the state evidently did not deem that section applicable as it did not rely upon it in denying relief. The legal remedy under the state law being uncertain, the federal court has jurisdiction in equity to enjoin the assessment. Dawson v. Kentucky Distilleries Co.. 
20
21
The objection that it was not shown that these cases involve the jurisdictional amount is unsubstantial. The court below found that the amount due on outstanding construction warrants was approximately $and that the tentative apportionment of benefits, if undisturbed, would result in assessments for amounts ranging from $against the lands of the appellees. As the substantial basis of the suits was want of jurisdiction in the board of county commissioners to make the apportionment and assessment, we think the jurisdictional amount was necessarily involved.
21
22
Appellees are not estopped to seek the relief which was granted because of any relations which they may have had to the proceedings or to the construction work which had been carried on before notice of the tentative apportionment of benefits. The decrees of the District Court, which remain undisturbed, enjoin the assessments and further proceedings only so far as they affect lands lying outside of the original assessment areas of ditch No. 1 and ditch No. 2. As none of the appellees could have had any notice of the proposal to assess lands lying outside of these areas, until the published notice of the apportionment of benefits, their previous conduct cannot estop them from seeking the relief granted. Other objections were made to the decrees below, but they are not of sufficient gravity to require notice here.
22
23
There is no diversity of citizenship in No. 99, the appellee in that case being the city of Sioux Falls, a South Dakota municipal corporation. Nor was any substantial federal question raised by the bill of complaint in that suit. The power of the state and its agencies over municipal corporations within its territory is not restrained by the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. Trenton v. New Jersey, A. L. R. and see Pawhuska v. Pawhuska Oil Co., The decree in that case must therefore be reversed, and the cause remanded with directions to dismiss the plaintiff's bill.
23
24
No. 99, reversed and remanded.
24
 affirmed.

 Assessments for Further Costs. At any time after the damages arising from the establishment and construction of such drainage are paid and the lands for such drainage are taken, assessments may be made for further costs and expenses of construction. If the contractors are required and agree to take assessment certificates or warrants for their services, assessments need not be made until the completion of the work when an assessment shall be made for the entire balance of cost of construction * * * and notice of such assessment shall be given by the board of county commissioners in all respects as provided for the first assessment. And such assessment and the certificates issued thereon shall be in like manner perpetual liens upon the tracts assessed, interest-bearing and enforcible as such first assessment and certificates. * * * In any case, in the discretion of the board, several assessments may be made as the work progresses. * * *
'Sec. For the cleaning and maintenance of any drainage established under the provisions of this article, assessments may be made upon the landowners affected in the proportions determined for such drainage at any time upon the petition of any person setting forth the necessity thereof. * * * Such assessments shall be made as other assessments for the construction of drainage, certificates may be issued thereon and such assessments and certificates shall be liens * * * in all respects as original assessments. * * *'

ALEXANDER MILBURN CO.
v.
DAVIS-BOURNONVILLE CO.
Decided March 8, 1926.
1
This is a suit for the infringement of the plaintiff's patent for an improvement in welding and cutting apparatus alleged to have been the invention of one Whitford. The suit embraced other matters but this is the only one material here. The defence is that Whitford was not the first inventor of the thing patented, and the answer gives notice that to prove the invalidity of the patent evidence will be offered that one Clifford invented the thing, his patent being referred to and identified. The application for the plaintiff's patent was filed on March 4, 1911, and the patent was issued on June 4, 1912. There was no evidence carrying Whitford's invention further back. Clifford's application was filed on January 31, 1911, before Whitford's, and his patent was issued on February 6, 1912. It is not disputed that this application gave a complete and adequate description of the thing patented to Whitford, but it did not claim it. The District Court gave the plaintiff a decree, holding that while Clifford might have added this claim to his application, yet as he did not, he was not a prior inventor. The decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. There is a conflict between this decision and those of other Circuit Courts of Appeal, especially the sixth. Lemley v. Dobson-Evans Co., Naceskid Service Chain Co. v. Perdue, Therefore a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. L. Ed. 459.
1
2
The patent law authorizes a person who has invented an improvement like the present, 'not known or used by others in this country, before his invention,' etc., to obtain a patent for it. Rev. Sts. § amended by Act March (Comp. St. § . Among the defences to a suit for infringement the fourth specified by the statute is that the patentee 'was not the original and first inventor or discoverer of any material and substantial part of the thing patented.' Rev. Sts. § amended by Act March (Comp. St. § . Taking these words in their natural sense as they would be read by the common man, obviously one is not the first inventor if, as was the case here, somebody else has made a complete and adequate description of the thing claimed before the earliest moment to which the alleged inventor can carry his invention back. But the words cannot be taken quite so simply. In view of the gain to the public that the patent laws mean to secure we assume for purposes of decision that it would have been no bar to Whitford's patent if Clifford had written out his prior description and kept it in his portfolio uncommunicated to anyone. More than that, since the decision in the case of the Cornplanter Patent, it is said, at all events for many years, the Patent Office has made no search among abandoned patent applications, and by the words of the statute a previous foreign invention does not invalidate a patent granted here if it has not been patented or described in a printed publication. Rev. Sts. § . See Westinghouse Machine Co. v. General Electric Co., These analogies prevailed in the minds of the courts below.
2
3
On the other hand publication in a periodical is a bar. This as it seems to us is more than an arbitrary enactment, and illustrates, as does the rule concerning previous public use, the principle that, subject to the exceptions mentioned, one really must be the first inventor in order to be entitled to a patent. Coffin v. Ogden, We understand the Circuit Court of Appeals to admit that if Whitford had not applied for his patent until after the issue to Clifford, the disclosure by the latter would have had the same effect as the publication of the same words in a periodical, although not made the basis of a claim. The invention is made public property as much in the one case as in the other. But if this be true, as we think that it is, it seems to us that a sound distinction cannot be taken between that case and a patent applied for before but not granted until after a second patent is sought. The delays of the patent office ought not to cut down the effect of what has been done. The description shows that Whitford was not the first inventor. Clifford had done all that he could do to make his description public. He had taken steps that would make it public as soon as the Patent Office did its work, although, of course, amendments might be required of him before the end could be reached. We see no reason in the words or policy of the law for allowing Whitford to profit by the delay and make himself out to be the first inventor when he was not so in fact, when Clifford had shown knowledge inconsistent with the allowance of Whitford's claim, (Webster) Loom Co. v. Higgins, and when otherwise the publication of his patent would abandon the thing described to the public unless it already was old, McClain v. Ortmayer, Underwood v. Gerber, L. Ed. 710.
3
4
The question is not whether Clifford showed himself by the description to be the first inventor. By putting it in that form it is comparatively easy to take the next step and say that he is not an inventor in the sense of the statute unless he makes a claim. The question is whether Clifford's disclosure made it impossible for Whitford to claim the invention at a later date. The disclosure would have had the same effect as at present if Clifford had added to his description a statement that he did not claim the thing described because he abandoned it or because he believed it to be old. It is not necessary to show who did invent the thing in order to show that Whitford did not.
4
5
It is said that without a claim the thing described is not reduced to practice. But this seems to us to rest on a false theory helped out by the fiction that by a claim it is reduced to practice. A new application and a claim may be based on the original description within two years, and the original priority established notwithstanding intervening claims. Chapman v. Wintroath, L. Ed. 491. A description that would bar a patent if printed in a periodical or in an issued patent is equally effective in an application so far as reduction to practice goes.
5
6
As to the analogies relied upon below, the disregard of abandoned patent applications however explained cannot be taken to establish a principle beyond the rule as actually applied. As an empirical rule it no doubt is convenient if not necessary to the Patent Office, and we are not disposed to disturb it, although we infer that originally the practice of the Office was different. The policy of the statute as to foreign inventions obviously stands on its own footing and cannot be applied to domestic affairs. The fundamental rule we repeat is that the patentee must be the first inventor. The qualifications in aid of a wish to encourage improvements or to avoid laborious investigations do not prevent the rule from applying here.

270 U.S. 402
WEAVER, Chief of the Bureau of Inspection, Department of Labor and Industry of Pennsylvania,
v.
PALMER BROS. CO.
Argued Dec. 11, 1925.
1
Appellee is a Connecticut corporation, and for more than 50 years it and its founders have manufactured comfortables in that state, and have sold them there and in other states. An act of the Legislature of Pennsylvania, approved June (Pa. St. Supp. et seq.)) regulates the manufacture, sterilization, and sale of bedding. Section 1 of the act prescribes the following definitions:
1
2
'Mattress' means 'any quilted pad, mattress, mattress pad, mattress protector, bunk quilt or box spring, stuffed or filled with excelsior, straw, hay, grass, corn husks, moss, fibre, cotton, wool, hair, jute, kapok, or other soft material.' 'Pillow,' 'bolster,' or 'feather bed' means 'any bag, case, or covering made of cotton or other textile material, and stuffed or filled with' any filler mentioned in the definition of 'mattress,' or with feathers or feather down. The word 'comfortable' means 'any cover, quilt, or quilted article made of cotton or other textile material, and stuffed or filled with fibre, cotton, wool, hair, jute, feathers, feather down, kapok, or other soft material.' 'Cushion' means 'any bag or case made of leather, cotton, or other textile material, and stuffed or filled with' any filler, except jute and straw, mentioned in the definition of 'pillow,' or with tow. The word 'new,' as used in the act, means 'any material or article which has not been previously manufactured or used for any purpose. 'Secondhand' means 'any material or article of which prior use has been made.' 'Shoddy' means 'any material which has been spun into yarn, knit or woven into fabric, and subsequently cut up, torn up, broken up, or ground up.'
2
3
'No person shall employ or use in the making, remaking, or renovating of any mattress, pillow, bolster, feather bed, comfortable, cushion, or article of upholstered furniture: (a) Any material known as 'shoddy,' or any fabric or material from which 'shoddy' is constructed; (b) any secondhand material, unless, since last used, such secondhand material has been thoroughly sterilized and disinfected by a reasonable process approved by the commissioner of labor and industry; (c) any new or secondhand feathers, unless such new or secondhand feathers have been sterilized and disinfected by a reasonable process approved by the commissioner of labor and industry.'
3
4
Punishment by fine or imprisonment is prescribed for every violation of the act, and each sale is declared to be a separate offense.
4
5
The act took effect January 1, 1924. Appellant is charged with its enforcement, and threatened to proceed against the appellee and its customers. January 29, 1924, appellee brought this suit to enjoin the enforcement of the act on the grounds, among others, that, as applied to the business of appellee, it is repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. An application under section of the Judicial Code for a temporary injunction was denied. The decree was affirmed by this court. Later defendant answered, and there was a trial at which much evidence was introduced. The District Court found that the statute infringes appellee's constitutional rights in so far as it absolutely prohibits the use of shoddy in the manufacture of comfortables; and to that extent the decree restrains its enforcement. This appeal is under section of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. Supp. 
5
6
The question for decision is whether the provision purporting absolutely to forbid the use of shoddy in comfortables violates the due process clause or the equal protection clause. The answer depends on the facts of the case. Legislative determinations express or implied are entitled to great weight; but it is always open to interested parties to show that the Legislature has transgressed the limits of its power. Penna Coal Co. v. Mahon, L. Ed. Invalidity may be shown by things which will be judicially noticed (Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, L. Ed. 350) or by facts established by evidence. The burden is on the attacking party to establish the invalidating facts. See Minnesota Rate Cases, L. Ed. Ann. Cas. 
6
7
For many years prior to the passage of the act comfortables made in appellee's factories had been sold in Pennsylvania. In its business in that state exceeded $ of which more than $was for comfortables filled with shoddy. About dozens of these were filled with shoddy made of new materials, and about dozens with secondhand shoddy. Appellee makes approximately comfortables annually, and about of these are filled with materials defined by the act as shoddy. New material from which appellee makes shoddy consists of clippings and pieces of new cloth obtained from cutting tables in garment factories; secondhand shoddy is made of secondhand garments, rags, and the like. The record shows that annually many million pounds of fabric, new and secondhand, are made into shoddy. It is used for many purposes. It is rewoven into fabric, made into pads to be used as filling material for bedding, and is used in the manufacture of blankets, clothing, underwear, hosiery, gloves, sweaters and other garments. The evidence is to the effect that practically all the woolen cloth woven in this country contains some shoddy. That used to make comfortables is a different grade from that used in the textile industry. Some used by appellee for that purpose is made of clippings from new woolen underwear and other high grade and expensive materials. Comfortables made of secondhand shoddy sell at lower prices than those filled with other materials.
7
8
Appellant claims that, in order properly to protect health, bedding material should be sterilized. The record shows that, for the sterilization of secondhand materials from which it makes shoddy, appellee uses effective steam sterilizers. There is no controversy between the parties as to whether shoddy may be rendered harmless by disinfection or sterilization. While it is sometimes made from filthy rags, and from other materials that have been exposed to infection, it stands undisputed that all dangers to health may be eliminated by appropriate treatment at low cost. In the course of its decision the District Court said:
8
9
'It is conceded by all parties that shoddy may be rendered perfectly harmless by sterilization.'
9
10
The act itself impliedly determines that proper sterilization is practicable and effective. It permits the use of second hand materials and new and secondhand feathers when sterilized, and it regulates processes for such sterilization.
10
11
There was no evidence that any sickness or disease was ever caused by the use of shoddy, and the record contains persuasive evidence, and by citation discloses the opinions of scientists eminent in fields related to public health that the transmission of disease-producing bacteria is almost entirely by immediate contact with, or close proximity to, infected persons; that such bacteria perish rapidly when separated from human or animal organisms; and that there is no probability that such bacteria or vermin likely to carry them survive after the period usually required for the gathering of the materials, the production of shoddy, and the manufacture and the shipping of comfortables. This evidence tends strongly to show that in the absence of sterilization or disinfection there would be little, if any, danger to the health of the users of comfortables filled with shoddy, new or secondhand; and confirms the conclusion that all danger from the use of shoddy may be eliminated by ster ilization.
11
12
The state has wide discretion in selecting things for regulation. We need not consider whether the mere failure to forbid the use of other filling materials that are mentioned in the act is sufficient in itself to invalidate the provision prohibiting the use of shoddy, as a violation of the equal protection clause. But the number and character of the things permitted to be used in such manufacture properly may be taken into account in deciding whether the prohibition of shoddy is a reasonable and valid regulation or is arbitrary and violative of the due process clause. Shoddy-filled comfortables made by appellee are useful articles for which there is much demand; and it is a matter of public concern that the production and sale of things necessary or convenient for use should not be forbidden. They are to be distinguished from things that the state is deemed to have power to suppress as inherently dangerous.
12
13
Many states have enacted laws to regulate bedding for the protection of health. Legislation in Illinois (Laws went beyond mere regulation, and prohibited the sale of secondhand quilts or comfortables, even when sterilized, or when remade from sterilized secondhand materials. In People v. Weiner, L. R. A. Ann. Cas. the state Supreme Court held that to prohibit the use of material not inherently dangerous and that might be rendered safe by reasonable regulation trangresses the constitutional protection of personal and property rights.
13
14
The appellant insists that this case is ruled by Powell v. Pennsylvania, L. Ed. 253. But the cases are essentially different. A law of Pennsylvania prohibited the manufacture, sale, or possession for sale, of oleomargarine. An indictment against Powell charged a sale and possession with intent to sell. At the trial he admitted the allegations and, for his defense, offered to prove certain facts which were excluded as immaterial. The question for decision was whether these facts were sufficient to show that, as applied, the law was invalid. Mr. Justice Harlan, speaking for the court, said (U. S. p. that the purpose of these offers of proof was to—
14
15
'show that the article sold was a new invention, not an adulteration of dairy products, nor injurious to the public health, but wholesome and nutritious as an article of food. * * * () It will be observed that the offer in the court below was to show by proof that the particular articles the defendant sold, and those in his possession for sale, in violation of the statute, were, in fact, wholesome or nutritious articles of food. It is entirely consistent with that offer that many, indeed, that most kinds of oleomargarine butter in the market contain ingredients that are or may become injurious to health. The court cannot say, from anything of which it may take judicial cognizance, that such is not the fact. Under the circumstances disclosed in the record, and in obedience to settled rules of constitutional construction, it must be assumed that such is the fact.'
15
16
And see Powell v. Commonwealth, Am. Rep. 
16
17
'Laws frequently are enforced which the court recognizes as possibly or probably invalid if attacked by a different interest or in a different way.' Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, supra, L. Ed. 350. This is well illustrated by the Powell Case, compared with Schollenberger v. Pennsylvania, Every opinion is to be read, having regard to the facts of the case and the question actually decided. Cohens v. Virginia, L. Ed. 257. The facts clearly distinguish this case from the Powell Case. There it was assumed that most kinds of oleomargarine in the market were or might become injurious to health. Here it is established that sterilization eliminates the dangers, if any, from the use of shoddy. As against that fact, the provision in question cannot be sustained as a measure to protect health; and the fact that the act permits the use of numerous materials, prescribing sterilization if they are secondhand, also serves to show that the prohibition of the use of shoddy, new or old, even when sterilized, is unreasonable and arbitrary.
17
18
Nor can such prohibition be sustained as a measure to prevent deception. In order to ascertain whether the materials used and the finished articles conform to its requirements, the act expressly provides for inspection of the places where such articles are made, sold or kept for sale. Every article of bedding is required to bear a tag showing the materials used for filling and giving the names and addresses of makers and vendors, and bearing the word 'second-hand' where there has been prior use, and giving the number of the permit for sterilizing and disinfecting where secondhand materials or feathers are used for filling. Obviously, these regulations or others that are adequate may be effectively applied to shoddy-filled articles.
18
19
The constitutional guaranties may not be made to yield to mere convenience. Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, decided March 1, 1926. The business here involved is legitimate and useful; and, while it is subject to all reasonable regulation, the absolute prohibition of the use of shoddy in the manufacture of comfortables is purely arbitrary and violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Adams v. Tanner, L. Ed. Ann. Cas. Meyer v. Nebraska, A. L. R. Burns Baking Co. v. Bryan, A. L. R. 661.
19
20
Decree affirmed.

Mr. Justice HOLMES (dissenting).
21
22
If the Legislature of Pennsylvania was of opinion that disease is likely to be spread by the use of unsterilized shoddy in comfortables I do not suppose that this Court would pronounce the opinion so manifestly absurd that it could not be acted upon. If we should not, then I think that we ought to assume the opinion to be right for the purpose of testing the law. The Legislature may have been of opinion further that the actual practice of filling comfortables with unsterilized shoddy gathered from filthy floors was wide spread, and this again we must assume to be true. It is admitted to be impossible to distinguish the innocent from the infected product in any practicable way, when it is made up into the comfortables. On these premises, if the Legislature regarded the danger as very great and inspection and tagging as inadequate remedies, it seems to me that in order to prevent the spread of disease it constitutionally could forbid any use of shoddy for bedding and upholstery. Notwithstanding the broad statement in Schlesinger v. Wisconsin the other day, I do not suppose that it was intended to overrule Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, L. Ed. 184, and the other cases to which I referred there.

It is said that there was unjustifiable discrimination. A classification is not to be pronounced arbitrary because it goes on practical grounds and attacks only those objects that exhibit or foster an evil on a large scale. It is not required to be mathematically precise and to embrace every case that theoretically is capable of doing the same harm. 'If the law presumably hits the evil where it is most felt, it is not to be overthrown because there are other instances to which it might have been applied.' Miller v. Wilson, L. Ed. In this case, as in Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, I think that we are pressing the Fourteenth Amendment too far.

ASHE, Warden of State Penitentiary for Western District of Pennsylvania,
v.
UNITED STATES ex rel. VALOTTA.
Argued March 5, 1926.
1
This is an appeal from an order on a writ of habeas corpus discharging the relator, Valotta, from the custody of the appellant, by whom he was held under a sentence of death. Valotta shot a man in a street brawl-we will assume, in circumstances that suggest considerable excuse-and then killed a policeman who pursued him, within a short distance from the first act. He was indicted separately for the murder of each man, tried in a Court of Pennsylvania, found guilty of murder in the second degree for the first killing and guilty of murder in the first degree for the second, and was sentenced to death. The judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State.
1
2
No writ of error or certiorari was applied for, Valotta having no funds and his counsel being ignorant of the statute authorizing proceedings in such cases without prepayment of fees or costs. But when the time for such proceedings had gone by, a writ of habeas corpus was obtained from a judge of the District Court of the United States with the result that we have stated. The grounds of the order seem to have been that Valotta was tried upon two indictments for felony at the same time and was deprived of the full number of challenges that he would have had if he had been tried separately upon each.
2
3
There is no question that the State Court had jurisdiction. But the much abused suggestion is made that it lost jurisdiction by trying the two indictments together. Manifestly this would not be true even if the trial was not warranted by law. But the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has said that there was no mistake of law, and so far as the law of Pennsylvania was concerned it was most improper to attempt to go behind the decision of the Supreme Court, to construe statutes as opposed to it and to hear evidence that the practice of the State had been the other way. The question of constitutional power is the only one that could be raised, if even that were open upon this collateral attack, and as to that we cannot doubt that Pennsylvania could authorize the whole story to be brought out before the jury at once, even though two indictments were involved, without denying due process of law. If any question was made at the trial as to the loss of the right to challenge twenty jurors on each indictment, the only side of it that would be open here, would be again the question of constitutional power. That Pennsylvania could limit the challenges on each indictment to ten does not admit doubt.
3
4
There was not the shadow of a ground for interference with this sentence by habeas corpus. Frank v. Mangum, L. Ed. 969. Extraordinary cases where there is only the form of a court under the domination of a mob as was alleged to be the fact in Moore v. Dempsey, L. Ed. 543, offers no analogy to this. In so delicate a matter as interrupting the regular administration of the criminal law of the State by this kind of attack too much discretion cannot be used, and it must be realized that it can be done only upon definitely and narrowly limited grounds.

FIDELITY & DEPOSIT CO. OF MARYLAND
v.
TAFOYA et al.
Argued Jan. 7, 1926.
1
This is a bill in equity brought to prevent the State Corporation Commission of New Mexico from suspending the right of the plaintiff to do business in that State. A final decree was entered by which it was declared that the defendants intend to suspend that right 'for the sole reason that the plaintiff has made payments to its agents in states other than New Mexico in connection with the procurement of business made, written and placed by the plaintiff in New Mexico'; that such payments are unlawful by virtue of section of the New Mexico Code of as amended by chapter of the Laws of and that the section so far as it makes such payments unlawful and authorizes the suspension because of this is constitutional. On this ground the bill was dismissed. The plaintiffs contending that the statute as construed and applied is contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment appealed to this Court.
1
2
The statute in question, § of the Code of as amended in 1921, purports to make it 'unlawful for any insurance company authorized to do business in New Mexico * * * to pay, * * * either directly or indirectly, and fee, brokerage or other emolument of any nature to any person, firm or corporation not a resident of the State of New Mexico, for the obtaining, placing or writing of any policy or policies of insurance covering risks in New Mexico. Any insurance company violating this section shall have its certificates of authority to do business in this State suspended for not less than one year'-the suspension to be removed only upon a written pledge that the section will be observed. This section has been repealed by an act of , which substitutes the more moderate requirement that the policy must be delivered, the premium collected and the full commission retained by an agent in New Mexico, with authority to that agent to employ a licensed non-resident broker to collect the premiums, etc., and to pay him within limits. The question has been suggested whether this repeal does not require us to dismiss the case. But the Constitution of New Mexico provides that 'no act of the Legislature shall affect the right or remedy of either party * * * in any pending case' (art. 4, § 34). It is at least possible that the State Courts might hold that the plaintiff was still liable to lose its license on the old ground. Therefore it seems to us just that we should proceed to deal with the further questions raised, as both parties desire.
2
3
It is suggested that the District Court had no jurisdiction because the bill does not allege that the statute is unconstitutional, but only that the statute as construed and applied by the defendants is so. But even if the statute did not plainly purport to justify and require the threatened action, or if the bill fairly taken did not import a denial of the constitutionality of the law as applied to this case, the plaintiff still would be entitled to come into a Court of the United States to prevent such an alleged violation of its constitutional rights. Raymond v. Chicago Traction Co., L. Ed. Home Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Los Angeles, Cuyahoga River Power Co. v. Akron. 
3
4
Coming then to the merits we assume in favor of the defendants that the State has the power and constitutional right arbitrarily to exclude the plaintiff without other reason than that such is its will. But it has been held a great many times that the most absolute seeming rights are qualified, and in some circumstances become wrong. One of the most frequently recurring instances is when the so-called right is used as part of a scheme to accomplish a forbidden result. Frick v. Pennsylvania, American Bank & Trust Co. v. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, L. Ed. 983; Badders v. United States, L. Ed. 706; United States v. Reading Co., Thus the right to exclude a foreign corporation cannot be used to prevent it from resorting to a federal Court, Terral v. Burke Construction Co., A. L. R. 186; or to tax it upon property that by established principles the State has no power to tax, Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, and other cases in the same volume and later that have followed it; or to interfere with interstate commerce, Sioux Remedy Co. v. Cope, Looney v. Crane Co., Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Foster, L. Ed. A State cannot regulate the conduct of a foreign railroad corporation in another jurisdiction, even though the company has tracks and does business in the State making the attempt. New York, Lake Erie & Western R. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, L. Ed. 
4
5
The case last cited was one of an attempt to regulate the corporation's payments in another State. By the same principle on even stronger grounds the corporation cannot be prevented from employing and paying those whom it needs for its business outside the State. The difficulty was fully appreciated by the counsel for the appellee and he therefore sought to limit the generality of the words, at least in the case of agents, and to make out that the object was to prevent the use of dummy agents in the State. It was suggested that agents were paid by commissions at well known conventional rates and that the statute meant to forbid the dividing of these commissions, and in that way to prevent the work being done and paid for elsewhere, while nominal agents in New Mexico were paid small sums for the use of their names. In short it is said the purpose was to secure responsible men to represent the company on the spot. But whether such an interpretation would save the act or not it is impossible to limit it in that way. It forbids the payment of any emolument of any nature to any person for the obtaining, placing or writing of any policy covering risks in New Mexico. The words go beyond any legitimate interest of the State, and although the decree is based only on payments to agents it does not declare that the payments thus made prevented the payment of appropriate commissions to the agents in the State nor does the statute limit its prohibition in that way.
5
6
The determination of the Commission to suspend the plaintiff purported to be based upon a letter written by it in reply to a notice. In this letter it appeared only that agents or branch offices in other states were paid for services of value by commission on such basis as was agreed upon outside of New Mexico, but not that there was in any case a deduction from appropriate commissions inside the State. The threat and the decree, therefore, test the validity of the statute in its extreme application and furnish no ground for an attempt to read it as meaning less than it says. See further Palmetto Fire Insurance Co. v. Beha (D. C. S. D. N. Y., Nov. St. Louis Compress Co. v. Arkansas.

Decree reversed.

The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.
8
9
This cause was begun January 8, 1924. Defendants were the members of the State Corporation Commission and the bank examiner. Section Code of New Mexico forbade the carrying on of business within the state by any insurance company 'unless it shall procure from the superintendent of insurance a certificate stating that the requirements of the laws of this state have been complied with, and authorizing it to do business.' These certificates expired annually on the last day of February. In the powers and duties of the superintendent of insurance were transferred to the bank examiner under general control and supervision of the Corporation Commission.
9
of the Code, as amended, provided that no foreign insurance company shall transact business in the state except through duly appointed resident agents; declared it unlawful to pay any emolument to a nonresident for obtaining policies covering risks therein; and authorized the exclusion of any company which failed to observe this inhibition.
10
11
The bill alleges that although the complainant had been duly licensed to transact business in New Mexico for many years defendants were threatening to suspend the license therefor because of supposed violations of section It asks a decree declaring that section unconstitutional in so far as payments to nonresidents for procuring insurance were prohibited; and that defendants be restrained from attempting to revoke or refusing to renew the license certificate.
11
12
The act effective March 20, 1925, codified the insurance laws of the state; expressly repealed former statutes regulating the business; transferred the powers of the bank examiner to the corporation commission, and charged the superintendent of the department of insurance with general administration of the law. It sets up an entirely new system of control and contains no provision concerning payments to outside agents like the one challenged by complainant. It provides:
12
13
'Upon the application of any insurance company for a license to transact an insurance business in the state of New Mexico, the superintendent shall immediately satisfy himself that the said company * * * has * * * complied with all the * * * requirements of this act, and shall thereupon be obligated to issue a license to the said company authorizing it to transact the forms of insurance permitted under its articles of incorporation and authorized under this act for any one insurance company to transact.' Section 70.
13
14
The bill questions the validity of a statute which was repealed in 1925. There is no effective remedy which this or any other court can now grant under its allegations and prayers. The cause has become moot and should be treated accordingly.

15
Mr. Justice BRANDELS and Mr. Justice SANFORD concur in this opinion.

BARNETTE
v.
WELLS FARGO NEVADA NAT. BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO et al.
Submitted Jan. 15, 1926.
1
The appellant brought suit in the superior court of San Francisco county, Cal., for the surrender and cancellation of a deed of land and to recover money received by the appellee Noyes, a receiver acting under the appointment of an Alaska court, and deposited by him with the appellee bank, as rents derived from the land conveyed and as proceeds of the sale of part of it. The conveyance was made by appellant to receivers, predecessors in office of the appellee Noyes, appointed by the District Court for the District of Alaska. Relief was sought on the ground that the conveyance had been procured by duress. The cause was removed to the United States District Court for Northern California, and trial in that court resulted in a decree for the plaintiff. On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals the decree was reversed on the ground that the suit was barred by laches. The case comes to this court on appeal. Judicial Code, § , before Act of February .
1
2
The jurisdiction of the District Court was not challenged in the Circuit Court of Appeals; nor is it challenged here. The petition for removal from the state court to the District Court and the motion to remand, made and denied in the latter, are not shown in the record. They were omitted from the transcript made up on appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, because the parties had so stipulated under rule 75 of the Equity Rules then in force (U. S. Appendix, p. 23) relating to the reduction and preparation of transcripts on appeals in suits in equity. It therefore does not affirmatively appear on what ground the removal to the District Court was sought, allowed and sustained. But an examination of the bill, which is set forth in the record, shows that the purpose of the suit was to recover land and funds then in charge of the receiver of a court in Alaska which was created by laws of Congress, and derived its powers and authority from those laws. Such a suit was removable under section 28 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. § , as supplemented by the amendment of section 33 by the Act of August (Comp. St. s . Matarazzo v. Hustis (D. C.) see Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Cox, L. Ed. 829; Board of Commissioners v. Peirce (C. C.) The alleged right to recover grew out of transactions between the plaintiff and the receivers within the territory of Alaska with reference to land located in Alaska, in all of which the receivers were acting in virtue of authority conferred on them as officers of the Alaska court. Rouse v. Hornsby, L. Ed. 817. As all this is apparent from the face of the bill, and as the removal is not challenged here, we think the presumption should be indulged that the removal was rightly taken, and that the District Court had jurisdiction.
2
3
We recognize that property in charge of a receiver is in the custody of the court by which he was appointed and under which he is acting, and that as a general rule other courts cannot entertain a suit against the receiver to recover such property, except by leave of the court of his appointment. Lion Bonding Co. v. Karatz, L. Ed. 871. But the record shows that shortly after this suit was begun, the court in Alaska expressly authorized the receiver to appear in the suit and to make defense and present a counterclaim in it. This was the full equivalent of granting leave to bring the suit. That the order was made shortly after, instead of before the suit was begun, is not material. Jerome v. McCarter, Board of Commissioners v. Peirce, supra, The plaintiff contended and the District Court held that, even if there had been no such leave, the suit could be maintained under the legislative permission given in section 66 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. § ; but we need not consider that question.
3
4
On January 5, 1911, the District Court for Alaska appointed receivers for the Washington-Alaska Bank, a Nevada banking corporation engaged in business in Fairbanks, Alaska. The husband of the appellant had been the president, director and manager of the bank from its incorporation. In February, 1911, the appellant, then residing in Los Angeles, Cal., went with her husband to Fairbanks to assist in the liquidation of the bank's business, its assets and affairs being then in the hands of the receivers. Six weeks later, after consultation with their attorney, appellant and her husband tendered to one of the depositors of the bank as trustee for the unpaid depositors, a deed conveying real estate of the husband and real estate which was the separate property of the appellant, located in Alaska. Acceptance of the deed was refused on the ground that by it criminal prosecution of the husband and enforcement of his civil liability might be prejudiced or waived. Later a similar deed was tendered to the receivers and rejected by them for the same reasons. Appellant and her husband then filed a verified petition in the court in which the receivership was pending, praying that the receivers be directed to accept the trust deed and expressing the desire to prevent the commencement of legal proceedings against them by the receivers and to pay all the depositors of the bank in full. The court made an order authorizing the receivers, as such, to accept the deed and administer the trusts created by it, in connection with their duties as receivers.
4
5
The deed was executed by appellant and her husband on March 18, 1911, and was separately acknowledged by appellant, the certificate of acknowledgment stating that she executed it voluntarily and that 'she did not wish to retract it.' The receivers took possession of the property in Alaska; they and later their successor, the appellee, Noyes, received the rents from it and the proceeds of sale of some of the land, and the fund now in dispute was derived from the administration of the trust.
5
6
Within a week after executing the conveyance appellant departed from Alaska with her husband and returned to her residence at Los Angeles. More than three years later, on November 16, 1914, she instituted suit in the Alaska court against the receivers, to set aside the conveyance of her separate property on the ground that it had been procured by duress. The case was not brought to trial and after more than three years, on August 1, 1918, she consented to a nonsuit, having in the meantime, on July 24, 1918, commenced the present suit.
6
7
The District Court below held that appellant's conveyance had been procured by duress. This conclusion was based on findings that during the period of appellant's sojourn in Alaska in 1911 threats or 'suggestions' were made to her (which it appears were made by two women depositors of the bank and by others who are unidentified) that her children would be kidnapped and her husband and herself subjected to personal violence; that under the circumstances these threats aroused in her a reasonable fear for the safety of her children, her husband and herself, and induced the execution of the deed to the receivers.
7
8
We turn aside from the objections pressed upon us that the evidence was insufficient to establish duress and that in neither pleading nor proof is it suggested that the receivers or the great majority of the creditors of the bank were parties to or aware of the alleged duress. See Fairbanks v. Snow, Am. St. Rep. Nor need we consider any of the numerous defenses interposed, except the acquiescence of appellant in her deed, and her delay in asserting her rights, which, in the circumstances, are decisive of the case.
8
9
Appellant's cause of action is necessarily founded upon the assertion of the rightful and effective exercise of the power to disaffirm her conveyance, which arose as soon as she was relieved from the compulsion of the alleged duress. Acts induced by duress such as is here relied on, which operates only on the mind and falls short of actual physical compulsion, are not void in law, but are voidable only, at the election of him whose act was induced by it. Andrews v. Connolly (C. C.) Miller v. Davis, Eberstein v. Willetts, Fairbanks v. Snow, supra; Miller v. Lumber Co., Am. St. Rep. Oregon & P. R. R. Co. v. Forrest, If there was duress here, appellant, as soon as she was relieved from its operation, was in a position either to disaffirm her conveyance or to allow it to stand undisturbed as the free and formal disposition of her rights. If her choice was to disaffirm, it might have been evidenced by suit timely brought or by any other action disclosing her purpose to those who would be affected.
9
10
In that situation she was subject to the requirement of equity that an election to disaffirm and to recall the legal consequences of an act which has operated to alter legal rights by transferring them to others, must be exercised promptly. Andrews v. Connolly and other cases cited, supra, show how this requirement is applied in cases of duress. The principle has a like application where the right is founded on fraud. Upton, Assignee, v. Tribilcock, Wheeler v. McNeil, Blank v. Aronson. 
10
11
What promptness of action a court may reasonably exact in these circumstances must depend in large measure upon the effect of lapse of time without such disaffirmance, upon those whose rights are sought to be divested. The appellant formed the intention of taking proceedings to set aside her conveyance immediately on her return to Los Angeles, in April, 1911. This intention remained undisclosed for more than three years until she brought suit in the district court of Alaska in November, 1914. There is no evidence that the threats of violence were renewed after she left Alaska, or that they operated to prevent the prompt exercise of her election when she had returned to her home in Los Angeles. Her husband was brought to trial upon criminal charges growing out of his administration of the affairs of the bank, and criminal proceedings were concluded in December, 1912, or in 1913. During the period from April, 1911, until November, 1914, appellant, who was represented in Alaska by counsel and by an attorney in fact, was aware that the receivers, and later the appellee Noyes, none of whom was shown to have had any knowledge of the alleged duress, were engaged in the administration of the trust created by appellant's conveyance, under an order of the court obtained on her petition. During that period, she made no effort to advise the court or the receivers of the alleged duress or of her intention to disaffirm her deed.
11
12
By the provisions of the deed, the grantees were given unrestricted power of sale of the property after November, 1914, but it was expressly provided that sales might be made in the meantime by the united action of the grantors and grentees, and the proceeds paid to the grantees under the trust provisions of the deed. Appellant joined with her husband and the appellee receiver in a sale of one of the plots of her separate property, the conveyance being executed in her behalf by her attorney in fact and the proceeds being paid to the appellee in November, 1911. This unexplained delay of more than three years in exercising appellant's asserted right to disaffirm her conveyance, while the appellee and his predecessors were left in ignorance of her intention to assert it, and her affirmative action as well, in recognizing the validity of her deed and the authority of the appellee under it, establish conclusively her election to allow her conveyance to stand as the unrevoked and effective agency for the disposition of her rights.
12
13
The case is not one which requires us to consider the effect of mere delay in bringing suit to enforce a claim of which appellees had notice, with the consequent opportunity to protect themselves, in some measure, from the prejudice which would otherwise result from mere lapse of time, as in Simmons Creek Coal Co. v. Doran, and Southern Pacific Co. v. Bogart, relied upon by appellant. Nor have we to do with a situation where complainant's silence did not mislead or prejudice the defendants, as in Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, also relied upon. Here the very existence of the appellant's right depends upon the timely exercise of her election to disaffirm the deed. Delay in its exercise was necessarily prejudicial to her grantees; for they were entitled to and did rely and act upon the authority of her deed, and their defense under the circumstances was necessarily impeded and embarrassed by the lapse of time during the period in which they were left in ignorance of appellant's claim.
13
14
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.
14
15
Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, with whom Mr. Justice SANFORD concurs, dissenting.
15
16
In my opinion, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed with directions to the District Court to remand the case to the state court, or this court should, in its discretion, order that copies of all papers in the District Court relating to the removal be filed here, so that we may determine whether the lower courts have properly exercised jurisdiction. Compare order issued February 1, 1926, in No. 10, Whitney v. California, Sup. Ct. Journ. 
16
17
The determination of the jurisdiction of the courts below is one of the essential functions of this court. Cochran v. Montgomery County, Ann. Cas. 451. 'On every writ of error or appeal, the first and fundamental question is that of jurisdiction, first, of this court, and then of the court from which the record comes. This question the court is bound to ask and answer for itself, even when not otherwise suggested, and without respect to the relation of the parties to it.' Mansfield, Coldwater & Lake Michigan Ry. Co. v. Swan, L. Ed. 462); Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Ry. Co. v. Willard, L. Ed. 521; Baltimore & Ohio R. R. v. City of Parkersburg, L. Ed. 834. The record must show affirmatively 'the fact on which jurisdiction depends. It is not sufficient that jurisdiction may be inferred argumentatively, from its averments.' Brown v. Keene; Hanford v. Davies, If the jurisdictional facts appear affirmatively somewhere in the record, the case need not be dismissed merely because the pleadings fail to show them. Robertson v. Cease, Realty Holding Co. v. Donaldson, L. Ed. 1014. Amendment of the pleadings to conform to the facts shown by the record may be allowed either in the lower courts or in this court. Norton v. Larney, L. Ed. 413. The record before this court, which consists of printed pages and several unprinted documents, includes everything which was before the Circuit Court of Appeals, but not the whole record before the District Court. What parts were omitted does not appear. The essential jurisdictional facts are not shown in the pleadings or elsewhere in the record.
17
18
The record in this court shows a bill of complaint to have a conveyance of real estate in Alaska annulled on the ground of duress and to have paid to the plaintiff moneys alleged to have been deposited in the Wells Fargo Nevada National Bank of San Francisco by one Noyes, claiming to act as receiver of a Nevada corporation. These funds are alleged to be the proceeds of a part of the real estate. The complaint is entitled 'Superior Court of the State of California.' The record shows next an answer filed in the federal court for the Northern district of the state. All subsequent proceedings prior to the appeal were had in that federal court. From these facts, it may merely be surmised that the suit was begun in the state court and before answer removed to the federal court. But the record does not contain the petition for removal, nor any of the other papers ordinarily incident thereto. There is no reference to a removal in any order or decree, in any opinion, in the evidence, nor in any other paper or clerk's entry. The complaint did not allege the citizenship of the plaintiff. An amendment to the complaint, filed in the federal court two years later, states that the plaintiff has at all times been a citizen of California. The defendants named are the Wells Fargo Bank and one Noyes; the latter being joined both individually and as receiver appointed 'not lawfully' but an Alaska court for a Nevada corporation. No allegation discloses the citizenship of Noyes. It does not appear anywhere in the record whether an ancillary receiver of the Nevada corporation was ever appointed in California.
18
19
A multitude of questions remain unanswered in this state of the record. Thus, we are left to conjecture whether all the defendants joined in the petition for removal,1 and if not, by whom removal was sought;2 on what ground removal was sought, whether that ground was good in law, and whether it was substantiated by the facts appearing of record;3 from what court removal was sought;4 what action the court and the respective parties took; and whether, indeed, there was a proper petition for removal filed in time.5 On this record it seems to me that this court is without jurisdiction and that the lower federal courts were also. Hegler v. Faulkner, L. Ed. 210. As stated in West v. Aurora City, :
19
20
'It is equally fatal to the supposed right of removal that the record presents only a fragment of a cause, unintelligible except by reference to other matters not sent up from the state court and through explanations of counsel.'
20
21
'There are no presumptions in favor of the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.' Ex parte Smith; Bible Society v. Grove, We may not assume that there was jurisdiction merely because two lower courts have exercised it, apparently without protest.6 We may not assume that documents omitted from the appellate record by agreement under equity rule 75 showed jurisdiction. The requirement that jurisdictional facts be affirmatively shown cannot be dispensed with. Compare Hudson v. Parker, L. Ed. 424. We may not indulge in conjecture as to the ground on which jurisdiction was invoked. If we were at liberty to do so, what appears in the fragmentary record before us would preclude our sustaining jurisdiction. Jurisdiction could not be sustained on the ground of diversity of citizenship, because the citizenship of the principal defendant is not disclosed. Jurisdiction could not be sustained under section 33, Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of August (Comp. St. § , as a civil suit against 'any officer of the courts of the United States for or on account of any act done under color of his office or in the performance of his duties as such officer' (compare Matarazzo v. Hustis (D. C.) , because there is nothing to show that removal was sought upon this ground, or that the requirements of the statute were complied with (compare Ex parte Anderson, Fed. Cas. No. Rothschild v. Matthews (C. C.) 22 F. 6), or that there was 'a causal connection between what the officer has done' and his asserted official authority. See Maryland v. Soper, Jurisdiction could not be sustained on the ground that the proceeding is ancillary, because no receiver of the Alaska bank was appointed in California, nor was its estate being administered there (Mercantile Trust Co. v. Kanawha & Ohio Ry. Co. (C. C.) Compare Greene v. Star Cash & Package Co. (C. C.) , and the ancillary character of the suit furnishes no ground for removal (Gilmore v. Herrick (C. C.) Compare Byers v. McAuley, L. Ed. 867; Shinney v. North American Savings & Loan Bldg. Co. (C. C.) 97 F. 9). Jurisdiction could not be sustained on the ground that the case is one 'arising under the * * * laws of the United States,' because the mere fact that the defendant Noyes is the reputed receiver of a state corporation appointed by a federal court is not a ground for removal.7 Gableman v. Peoria, Decatur & Evansville Ry. Co., The record shows no other way in which the case arises under the laws of the United States. There is no actual controversy as to any federal matter. Compare Niles Bement Pond Co. v. Iron Moulders' Union Local No.

Following the decision of this Court in Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v.

Other lower courts, recognizing that limitation and also the distinction with respect to receivers of national banks, Grant v. Spokane Nat. Bank (C.

Trumbull (C. C.) 75 F. 33; Marrs v. Felton (C. C.) Chesapeake, Ohio & S. W. R. R. Co.'s Receivers v. Smith, This court, after holding in Bausman v. Dixon, that 'the mere order of the Circuit Court appointing a receiver did not create a federal question,' held in Gableman v. Peoria, Decatur & Evansville Ry. Co., that no removal could be allowed solely on the ground of the receiver having secured his appointment from a federal court. That case and the limitations it established have since been consistently recognized and followed. Pepper v. Rogers (C. C.) People of New York v. Bleecker St. & F. F. R. Co. (C. C.)

EDWARDS, Collector of Internal Revenue,
v.
CHILE COPPER CO.
Argued March 10, 11, 1926.
1
This is a suit to recover the amount of taxes alleged to have been erroneously collected for the years The taxes were levied under the Acts of September (Comp. St. § ) and of February and (c), (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. ). Both statutes impose upon domestic corporations organized for profit a tax 'with respect to the carrying on or doing business,' at certain rates for the fair value of the capital stock, and both exempt such corporations 'not engaged in business' during the preceding taxable year. The question is whether the plaintiff, the Chile Copper Company, brings itself within this exemption. The facts are set forth in the complaint and the case was heard upon a motion to dismiss. In the District Court judgment was given for the plaintiff Chile Copper Co. v. Edwards, The judgment was affirmed on the opinion below by the Circuit Court of Appeals. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. 
1
2
The facts are somewhat peculiar. The Chile Exploration Company, a New Jersey corporation, owned mines in Chile and needed to borrow large sums of money in order to develop them. By the laws of Chile it could not mortgage its mines effectively and therefore could not give security directly for bonds. To meet the difficulty the Chile Copper Company was organized in Delaware for the purpose of holding the capital stock of the Chile Exploration Company, issuing bonds secured by a pledge of the stock, and furnishing the proceeds from time to time to the Exploration Company to enable the latter to go on with its work. The purpose was carried out. On April 1, 1917, the plaintiff authorized the issue of collateral trust bonds for $to be secured by a pledge of all the above-mentioned stock. During the six months ending on June 30, 1917, it executed an agreement with underwriters and issued $of the bonds, received payments from subscribers, which were deposited in a special account with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York, paid the expenses of the issue from the special account and made provision for the accrued interest payable upon the bonds. It also paid the interest on $of bonds outstanding under an earlier pledge. During the same time stockholders' and directors' meetings were held, directors and officers were chosen, corporate books and accounting records were kept, and such other acts were done and expenses paid as were necessary to keep up the corporate existence. An office was maintained for the activities described. The plaintiff owned and voted on the stock of the Exploration Company, and elected its directors, and made advances to it from the proceeds of the bonds issued in 1917, the Guaranty Trust Company being directed after payment of certain matters not to pay checks drawn upon the special account unless accompanied by a letter from the plaintiff stating that the proceeds would be used for specified purposes connected with the development of the mines. The plaintiff agreed to furnish and did furnish the Guaranty Company statements showing that the proceeds had been so applied. During the six months mentioned the sum of $was advanced to the Exploration Company, and interest upon loans and a part of the bond discount paid by it to the plaintiff and payments on account of a dividend also were made.
2
3
The activities for succeeding years were similar, advances to the Exploration Company being made each year. The plaintiff had funds received from the issue of bonds in 1917, in excess of the amounts that it thought proper to advance during the given period to the Exploration Company. A part of these it invested in Liberty Bonds, but the greater part, which it had deposited with the Guaranty Trust Company and the Central Union Trust Company, it authorized those companies to lend on call in the plaintiff's name and at its risk, taking security. If the security was not satisfactory the plaintiff directed the Trust Company to call the loan. During the year ending June 30, 1920, 224 loans amounting to $were made and loans amounting to $were called. In the same year the plaintiff received $as interest upon these loans. During the previous year it received $upon similar loans.
3
4
If the corporation was one that Congress had power to tax in this way, it is hard to say that it is not within the taxing acts. It was organized for profit and was doing what it principally was organized to do in order to realize profit. The cases must be exceptional, when such activities of such corporations do not amount to doing business in the sense of the statutes. The exemption 'when not engaged in business' ordinarily would seem pretty nearly equivalent to when not pursuing the ends for which the corporation was organized, in the cases where the end is profit. In our opinion the plaintiff was liable to the tax. We do not rest our conclusion upon the issue of bonds in the first year or the call loans made in the last, and for the same reasons we cannot let the fagot be destroyed by taking up each item of conduct separately and breaking the stick. The activities and situation must be judged as a whole. Looking at them as a whole we see that the plaintiff was a good deal more than a mere conduit for the Chile Exploration Company. It was its brain or at least the efferent nerve without which that company could not move. The plaintiff owned and by indirection governed it, and was its continuing support, by advances from time to time in the plaintiff's discretion. There was some suggestion that there was only one business and therefore ought to be only one tax. But if the one business could not be carried on without two corporations taking part in it, each must pay, by the plain words of the Act. The case is not governed by McCoach v. Minehill & Schuylkill Haven R. Co., and United States v. Emery, Bird, Thayer Realty Co., L. Ed. 825. It is nearer to Von Baumbach v. Sargent Land Co..

SMITH
v.
McCULLOUGH et al.
Argued Oct. 8, 1925.
1
This appeal brings under review the proceedings in a much-litigated suit in equity brought to determine adverse claims based on conflicting mining leases given by a Quapaw Indian of land which was part of his allotment. The plaintiffs (appellees here) claimed under the first lease, and the defendant (appellant here) under two later leases, which taken together included the same land as the first. The relief sought by the plaintiffs was full recognition of their lease and cancellation of the others. On the original hearing the District Court, following its decisions in earlier cases, held that the plaintiffs' lease contravened restrictions imposed by laws of Congress, in that it was for a longer term than ten years, and therefore was void. Accordingly the bill was dismissed; but the Circuit Court of Appeals disapproved that ruling, reversed the decree and remanded the cause for further proceedings. On a subsequent hearing the District Court recognized the plaintiffs' lease as valid for a term of 10 years and canceled the defendant's leases to the extent of the conflict. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision (, and the present appeal is from the decree of affirmance.
1
2
The plaintiffs insist that this appeal cannot be entertained, although taken prior to the Act of February changing federal appellate jurisdiction. But we think they misapprehend the situation.
2
3
The suit was not within any of the classes as to which an appeal was denied by section of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. § , as existing before the change. Either the suit was one arising under the laws of Congress relating to the alienation and leasing of Quapaw allotments, or there was an entire absence of federal jurisdiction. In either event section of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. § , as existing before the change, permitted an appeal to this court from the final decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals. The only difference was that if the suit was one arising under the laws of Congress relating to the alienation and leasing of such allotments the re-examination by this court would extend to the merits, while, if there was an absence of federal jurisdiction, this court could not consider the merits, but would have to reverse the decrees of both courts below, and remand the cause to the District Court, with a direction to dismiss the bill for want of jurisdiction. Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter, L. Ed. 864; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Ann Arbor R. R. Co., L. Ed. 1052. The act of expressly left all appeals which were then pending in this court to be disposed of under the old law.
3
4
It therefore is necessary at the outset to determine whether this suit was one arising under the legislation relating to Quapaw allotments, or was one where there was an absence of federal jurisdiction. The established rule is that a plaintiff, suing in a federal court, must show in his pleading, affirmatively and distinctly, the existence of whatever is essential to federal jurisdiction, and, if he does not do so, the court, on having the defect called to its attention or on discovering the same, must dismiss the case, unless the defect be corrected by amendment. Norton v. Larney. 
4
5
Here the bill disclosed that the lease under which the plaintiffs were claiming, and which they sought to have recognized, was based on the laws of Congress relating to the right of Quapaw allottees to alienate and lease their lands, and that the defendant was claiming adversely under later leases from the same lessor. It apparently was intended to show that the suit was one arising under those laws; but it fell short of showing that a real dispute over their construction and application was involved. See Shulthis v. McDougal, L. Ed. 1205; Barnett v. Kunkel, In fact, as appears elsewhere in the record, that was the principal matter in dispute, and the outcome depended on its solution. The defendant's first step in the suit was to challenge the plaintiffs' right to relief by a motion to dismiss on the ground that under those laws, rightly construed and applied, the plaintiffs' lease was invalid. That challenge was sustained by the District Court, but was overruled by the Circuit Court of Appeals on the first appeal. A simple amendment of the bill, conforming its jurisdictional allegations to the fact thus brought into the record, would have corrected the defect and put in affirmative and definite form what apparently was intended in the beginning. Had the defect been called to the court's attention, leave to make the amendment could and doubtless would have been granted. But both parties proceeded as if the jurisdictional showing was sufficient; and both courts below dealt with the suit as one arising under the laws before named and proceeded to its determination accordingly. The suit was begun in 1916; the parties had two hearings in each of the courts below; and the merits were exhaustively presented. In these circumstances to amend the bill now to conform to the jurisdictional fact indisputably shown elsewhere in the record will not subject either party to any prejudice or disadvantage, but will subserve the real interests of both. This court has power to allow amendments of this character (Rev. Stat. § ; Norton v. Larney, supra; Realty Holding Co. v. Donaldson, and the propriety of exercising it in this instance is obvious. We therefore shall treat the bill as amended, by our leave, to show the jurisdictional fact conformably to other parts of the record. With that fact brought into the bill, there can be no doubt that there was federal jurisdiction. Hopkins v. Walker, Norton v. Larney, supra.
5
6
The plaintiffs insist that, as the defendant did not appeal from the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals on the first appeal, he is now precluded from questioning what was decided then. But the law and settled practice are otherwise. That decree was not final but only interlocutory, and so was not appealable. Nor did the defendant acquiesce in it. On the contrary, he sought to have it reconsidered by the Circuit Court of Appeals on a timely petition for rehearing, and again on the second appeal to that court. He therefore is entitled to ask, as he does in his assignments of error, that it be re-examined on this appeal. United States v. Beatty, L. Ed. 686; Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co. v. Wolf Brothers & Co., L. Ed. 629.
6
7
We come, then, to the merits, which center about the validity of the plaintiffs' lease.
7
8
The lessor was a Quapaw Indian and under the guardianship of the United States. The land for which the conflicting mining leases were given was part of the allotment made to him in the distribution of the lands of his tribe. His title rested on a patent issued to him in 1896 pursuant to the Act of March which provided that the allotments should be inalienable for a period of 25 years from the date of the patents. The Act of June modified that restriction to the extent of authorizing the allottees 'to lease their lands, or any part thereof, for a term not exceeding three years for farming or grazing purposes, or ten years for mining or business purposes,' and the Act of June further modified the restriction to the extent of specially authorizing this allottee to alienate not exceeding acres of his allotment, subject to the supervision and approval of the Secretary of the Interior.
8
9
On July 14, 1906, the allottee, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, conveyed acres of his allotment to E. V. Kellett by a deed which described itself as a 'mortgage' and contained a declaration that it was made to secure the payment of a promissory note given to Kellett by the allottee and was to be null and void if the note was duly paid. In due course the note was paid, and on June 20, 1908, the land was reconveyed to the allottee by a deed which described itself as a 'release of mortgage' and contained an acknowledgment of such payment.
9
acres thus conveyed to Kellett and reconveyed to the allottee is the land for which the allottee gave the mining leases in question here. They were given in but were not approved by the Secretary of the Interior. The plaintiffs' lease was for a term exceeding 10 years, while the defendant's leases were limited to a 10-year term.
10
11
The evidence at the final hearing took a wide range, but in no wise tended to show either that the defendant was precluded from assailing the plaintiffs' lease or that the plaintiffs were entitled to any equitable relief if their lease was originally invalid. The defendant took his leases with notice of the plaintiffs' lease, but had been proceeding with operations under his for a year or two before any effort was made to take possession or begin operations under the plaintiffs'.
11
12
The first question on the merits is, whether the act of and the conveyance made to Kellett with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior took the land entirely out of the prior restrictions on its alienation, so that when that conveyance had served its purpose and the reconveyance to the allottee was made he was free to lease the land, and even to sell it, as he saw fit. The plaintiffs contend that the answer should be in the affirmative. Both courts below held the other way, and we think they were right. The act of did not accord to the allottee an unqualified right of alienation, but a right which was to be exercised only under the supervision and with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. Nor was the conveyance to Kellett an absolute alienation. In terms and effect it was a conditional conveyance, called a mortgage, and the contingency which might have converted it into an absolute alienation never happened. The Secretary's approval was of that particular conveyance and of course was measured by its terms and purpose. When the condition on which the conveyance was to be null and void was performed and the reconveyance was made the situation was essentially the same as if there had been no conveyance. In substance a lien had been created with the Secretary's approval and then extinguished, thus leaving the land subject to the restrictions.
12
13
This brings us to the defendant's contention that the plaintiffs' lease was void because given for a term exceeding 10 years. We have seen that the District Court originally so held, in keeping with its decisions in prior cases, and that the Circuit Court of Appeals, while regarding the lease as given for a term exceeding 10 years, held it good for that period and invalid as to the excess. To determine this conflict involves a consideration of the purpose and effect of the restrictive provisions in the acts of and an examination of the terms of the lease.
13
14
The act of declared broadly that the allotments should be inalienable for 25 years from the date of the patents, and the act of relaxed that restriction to the extent only of permitting the allottees to lease not exceeding a term of 3 years for farming or grazing purposes, or 10 years for mining or business purposes. Thus it was beyond the power of any allottee, on his own volition, to grant any interest in his allotment during the 25-year period otherwise than by a lease permitted by the act of United States v. Noble, L. Ed. 844. The plaintiffs' lease-it originally ran to one Hopper and was assigned by him to them-was given during that period and was for mining purposes. The consideration recited was $1 in hand paid and the lessee's covenants to begin operations within 90 days or pay a stated rent, to conduct the operations with diligence and to pay royalties of 5 per cent. of the market value of the minerals removed. The term of the lease was stated to be '10 years' from its date, but with the qualification that, if minerals were found in paying quantities, 'the privilege of operating' under the agreed terms should 'continue so long as' minerals could be produced in such quantities after the expiration of the 10 years, and that, if operations were not begun within 90 days, the lessee should pay, in lieu of such work, five cents an acre yearly for each acre in the lease 'so long as' he desired 'to operate and hold the same.' The parties rightly agree, as the courts below did, that these provisions, if taken together, show that the lease was not limited to a term of 10 years, but was to continue after that period so long as minerals could be produced with profit.
14
15
The Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the provisions just described were so far independent and severable that the one declaring that the term was to be 10 years should be given effect, and those declaring that it was to continue beyond that period should be rejected as invalid, and the lease sustained for a 10-year term. We think that conclusion overlooks the nature and purpose of the restrictions in the acts of In adopting the restrictions Congress was not imposing restraints on a class of persons who were sui juris, but on Indians who were being conducted from a state of dependent wardship to one of full emancipation and needed to be safeguarded against their own improvidence during the period of transition. The purpose of the restrictions was to give the needed protection, and they should be construed in keeping with that purpose. The permission to give short leases was in the nature of an exception to the comprehensive restraint already imposed and hardly could have been intended to give any effect or recognition to leases negotiated and made in disregard of that limited permission. A lease not within that permission evidently was intended to be left where it was before-within the general prohibition and invalid. Otherwise the allottees would be exposed to much of the evil intended to be excluded; for of course many intending lessees would be disposed to obtain leases for long terms if no other risk was run than that of having their rights held down to the maximum admissible term, if the allottee or the United States should discover the situation and take proceedings to correct it. Such a view would almost certainly result in beclouding the title of the allottees and in bringing the land into needless litigation to their detriment. We think the better view is that where an allottee undertakes to negotiate a lease for a forbidden term he enters a field in which he must be regarded as without capacity or authority to negotiate or act and that the resulting lease is void. See Taylor v. Parker, Sage v. Hampe, S. Ct. 94.
15
16
This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider other objections urged against the plaintiffs' lease. It follows that the first decree of the District Court was right and the subsequent decrees were wrong.

270 U.S. 476
CHEROKEE NATION
v.
UNITED STATES.
Argued March 8, 1926.
 this court affirmed a judgment of the Court of Claims for the principal of and the interest on four amounts due from the United States to the Cherokee Nation. United States v. Cherokee Nation, Id. The interest allowed in the judgment was 5 per cent. on the four claims from the accruing of liability to their payment. Since that judgment and its payment in full, the Cherokee Nation has presented to Congress the claim that more than simple interest was due, that the principal and interest due in 1895 should have been regarded as a lump sum, and that thereafter interest on the total at 5 per cent. to the time of payment should have been allowed. This, if granted, would be an additional sum of $per cent. interest from the dates of previous credits till paid. A special Act of Congress of March provides in part as follows:
1
2
'That jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon the Court of Claims to hear, consider, and determine the claim of the Cherokee Nation against the United States for interest, in addition to all other interest heretofore allowed and paid, alleged to be owing from the United States to the Cherokee Nation on the funds arising from the judgment of the Court of Claims of May eighteenth, nineteen hundred and five (Fortieth Court of Claims Reports, page two hundred and fifty-two), in favor of the Cherokee Nation. The said court is authorized, empowered, and directed to carefully examine all laws, treaties, or agreements, and especially the agreement between the United States and the Cherokee Nation of December nineteenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-one, ratified by the United States March third, eighteen hundred and ninety-three (Twenty-seventh Statutes at Large, page six hundred and forty, section ten), in any manner affecting or relating to the question of interest on said funds, as the same shall be brought to the attention of the court by the Cherokee Nation under this act. And if it shall be found that under any of the said treaties, laws, or agreements interest on one or more of the said funds, either in whole or in part, has not been paid and is rightfully owing from the United States to the Cherokee Nation, the court shall render final judgment therefor against the United States and in favor of the Cherokee Nation, either party to have the right to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States as in other cases.'

3
It is not necessary to recount the long and intricate history of the relations between the United States and the Cherokee Nation. It is complicated by the division between Cherokees into the Eastern Cherokees, who wished to become civilized and remain in the states east of the Mississippi, and those who preferred nomadic and hunting life in the West, and who first went to the Indian Territory and were called the Old Settlers. Ultimately the Eastern Cherokees were removed to the same place, and they and the Old Settlers were united in a common government again by the Treaty of . The sale and purchase and transfer of lands east and west of the Mississippi, the distribution of these, the cost of removal of the various bands of the Nation to Indian Territory, and other transactions involving expense were the subject of discussion and dispute between the government and the Nation and its different bands. In avowed conformity with the Treaty of Congress appropriated in 1852, the sum of $'in full satisfaction and a final settlement of all claims and demands whatsoever of the Cherokee Nation against the United States.' A full and final discharge was accordingly signed by the representatives of the Cherokee Nation, but under protest. Other claims, however, were thereafter made and paid, one of nearly $to the Old Settlers. Then in a case of The Old Settlers v. United States, 27 Ct. Cl. 1, affirmed by this court in a judgment for $with interest from and an additional $was given them.
3
 the United States desired to buy from the Cherokees what was known as the Cherokee Outlet in Oklahoma, embracing acres for settlement as public land. Under the authority of section 14 of the Act of March an agreement was made December 19, 1891, by the United States with the Cherokee Nation, by the first article of which the Cherokee Nation agreed to convey to the United States, acres between the h degree of west longitude, south of the Kansas line, and commonly known as the 'Cherokee Outlet.'
4
5
The fourth article of the agreement was as follows:
5
6
'Fourth. The United States shall, without delay, render to the Cherokee Nation, through any agent appointed by authority of the national council, a complete account of moneys due the Cherokee Nation under any of the treaties ratified in the years and any laws passed by Congress of the United States for the purpose of carrying said treaties, or any of them, into effect; and upon such accounting should the Cherokee Nation, by its National Council, conclude and determine that such accounting is incorrect or unjust, then the Cherokee Nation shall have the right within twelve (12) months to enter suit against the United States in the Court of Claims, with the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States by either party, for any alleged or declared amount of money promised but withheld by the United States from the Cherokee Nation, under any of said treaties or laws, which may be claimed to be omitted from or improperly or unjustly or illegally adjusted in said accounting; and the Congress of the United States shall at its next session, after such case shall be finally decided and certified to Congress according to law, appropriate a sufficient sum of money to pay such judgment to the Cherokee Nation, should judgment be rendered in her favor; or if it shall be found upon such accounting that any sum of money has been so withheld, the amount shall be duly appropriated by Congress, payable to the Cherokee Nation upon the order of its Antional Council, such appropriation to be made by Congress if then in session, and if not, then at the session immediately following such accounting.'
6
7
'Sixth. That in addition to the foregoing enumerated considerations for the cession and relinquishment of title to the lands hereinbefore provided the United States shall pay to the Cherokee Nation, at such time and in such manner as the Cherokee National Council shall determine, the sum of eight million five hundred and ninety-five thousand seven hundred and thirty-six and twelve one-hundredths ($ dollars in excess of the sum of seven hundred and twenty-eight thousand three hundred and eighty-nine and forty-six one-hundredths ($ dollars, the aggregate of amounts heretofore appropriated by Congress and charged against the lands of the Cherokees west of the Arkansas river, and also in excess of the amount heretofore paid by the Osage Indians for their reservation. So long as the money or any part of it shall remain in the Treasury of the United States after this agreement shall have become effective, such sum so left in the Treasury of the United States shall bear interest at the rate of five per centum per annum, payable semiannually: Provided, that the United States may at any time pay to said Cherokee Nation the whole or any part of said sum and thereupon terminate the obligation of the United States in respect to so much thereof as shall be so paid and in respect to any further interest upon the same.'
7
8
On January 4, 1892, the agreement of was approved by the Cherokee National Council. The agreement was ratified by Congress by section 10 of the Act of March , which appropriated $ to be immediately available and the remaining sum of $it was provided should be 'payable in five equal annual installments, commencing on the fourth day of March, eighteen hundred and ninety-five, and ending on the fourth day of March, eighteen to bear interest at the rate of four per to bear interest at the rate of our per centum per annum, to be paid annually.'
8
9
The act further provided that the acceptance by the Cherokee Nation of Indians of any of the money appropriated as therein set forth should be considered and taken and should operate as a full and complete relinquishment and extinguishment of all the title, claim, and interest in and to said lands of the Cherokee Nation.
9
10
The sum of $was appropriated by the act to enable the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, 'to employ such expert person or persons to properly render a complete account to the Cherokee Nation of moneys due said Nation, as required in the fourth subdivision of article II of said agreement.'
10
11
On May 17, 1893, a deed of cession was executed and delivered by the proper authorities of the Cherokee Nation to the United States and the first installment of the purchase money was paid to and accepted by the Cherokee Nation and the United States thereupon took possession of said lands, and thereafter disposed of the same. The other installments were duly and seasonably paid.
11
12
In pursuance of the Act of March 3, 1893, supra, the Secretary of the Interior promptly employed two expert accountants, Messrs. James A. Slade and Joseph T. Bender, to prepare an account between the United States and the Cherokee Nation, and on April 28, 1894, they filed it with the Secretary. The amounts due the Cherokee Nation were summed up as follows:

13
 Under the Treaty of 
 
 Value of three tracts of land containing
 acres at $per acre, to be added
 to the principal of the "school" fund.................. $ (With interest from February 27,
 1819, to date of payment.)
 
 Under Treaty of 
 
 Amount paid for removal of Eastern
 Cherokees to the Indian Territory,
 improperly charged to treaty fund................... $ (With interest from June 12, 1838,
 to date of payment.)
 
 Under Treaty of 
 
 Amount received by receiver of public
 moneys at Independence, Kan., never
 credited to Cherokee Nation.............................. $ (With interest from January 1, 1874,
 to date of payment.)

This was transmitted by the Secretary of the Interior to the proper authorities of the Cherokee Nation and it was accepted by act of the National Council approved December 1, 1894. It was then transmitted by the Secretary to Congress on January 7, 1895. The principal due on said account on March and the interest was $.
14
15
Instead of making an appropriation for this amount, Congress on March 2, 1895, referred the report of the Secretary of the Interior to the Attorney General and authorized and directed him to review the conclusions of law reached by the Department of the Interior in the account and report his conclusions at the next regular session. The Attorney General made his report December 2, 1895, which differed with the report of the Secretary of the Interior and the Slade and Bender report, holding that under the Treaty of and the settlement of by appropriation of Congress, the Cherokees were properly charged with the expense of removal and that the item in the report was improperly charged to the United States. No action was taken in settlement of the matter by Congress until July 1, 1902, when by section 68 of the Act of July it referred the claims to the Court of Claims, as follows:
15
16
'Jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon the Court of Claims to examine, consider, and adjudicate, with a right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States by any party in interest feeling aggrieved at the decision of the Court of Claims, any claim which the Cherokee Tribe, or any band thereof, arising under treaty stipulations, may have against the United States, upon which suit shall be instituted within two years after the approval of this act; and also to examine, consider, and adjudicate any claim which the United States may have against said tribe, or any band thereof. * * *'
16
17
Under this act, the Cherokee Nation brought suit against the United States, claiming the whole amount with interest found due by the Slade and Bender account. Thereafter the Eastern Cherokees and the Eastern and Emigrant Cherokees each brought suit under the Act of July 1, 1902, as amended by the Act of March , against the United States, each claiming the removal fund of $ The three suits were consolidated by order of the court, and were heard, considered, and decided together. The decree of the Court of Claims, in conformity with its opinion and conclusion of law entered March 20, 1905, was in part as follows:
17
18
'It is, this 18th day of May, A. D. adjudged, ordered, and decreed that the plaintiff, the Cherokee Nation, do have and recover of and from the United States as follows:
18
19
 Item 1: The sum of................................. $ With interest therefrom at the rate of
 5 per cent. from February 27, 1819,
 to date of payment.
 
 Item 2: The sum of.............................. $ With interest thereon at the rate of 5
 per cent. from June 12, 1838, to date
 of payment.
 
 Item 3: The sum of................................... $ With interest thereon at the rate of 5
 per cent. from January 1, 1874, to
 date of payment.
 
 Item With interest thereon from July 1, 1903,
 to date of payment."
19
20
Then followed directions as to the payment and distribution of the different items of the judgment. 
20
21
The case having come to this court on appeal, the judgment was affirmed on April 30, 1906, with a modification, consisting of a direction that item with interest at 5 per cent. from June 12, 1838, to date of payment, should be distributed among 'the Eastern Cherokees as individuals, whether east or west of the Mississippi, parties to the treaties of and exclusive of Old Settlers.' United States v. Cherokee Nation, On May 28, 1906, the Court of Claims entered a decree modifying its original decree to conform to the mandate of the Supreme Court. In attempted satisfaction of the judgment of the Court of Claims, an modified by the Supreme Court, and as directed by subsequent appropriation acts, there has been paid to the Cherokee Nation the sum of $.
21
22
The Court of Claims held in the case before us that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover any more interest and its petition was dismissed; hence this appeal.
22
23
The first question for our consideration is the effect of the act of in referring the issue in this case to the Court of Claims. The judgment of this court in the suit by the Cherokee Nation against the United States in March, already referred to, awarded a large amount of interest. The question of interest was considered and decided, and it is quite clear that, but for the special act of above quoted, the question here mooted would have been foreclosed as res judicata. In passing the act, Congress must have been well advised of this, and the only possible construction therefore to be put upon it is that Congress has therein expressed its desire, so far as the question of interest is concerned, to waive the effect of the judgment as res judicata, and to direct the Court of Claims to re-examine it and determine whether the interest therein allowed was all that should have been allowed, or whether it should be found to be as now claimed by the Cherokee Nation. The Solicitor General, representing the government, properly concedes this to the correct view. The power of Congress to waive such an adjudication of course is clear. See Nock v. United States, Braden v. United States, and United States v. Grant, L. Ed. 127. Compare United States v. Realty Co., L. Ed. 215; Allen v. Smith, United States v. Cook, L. Ed. 350; Work v. United States ex rel. Rives, L. Ed. 561; Mitchell v. United States, L. Ed. 644.
23
24
There is nothing before us which indicates that the present claim for a rest in the matter of interest in 1895, was presented either to the Court of Claims or to this court. It is a new argument not before considered. The argument is that the consideration for the land to be conveyed under the agreement of was not only the $to be paid, but also the appropriation by Congress of money to pay the old accounts long due, and that the failure of Congress to make the appropriation at the time agreed required that interest thereafter should be awarded upon the lump sum of principal and interest as of that date, in full payment of the purchase money for the land. The claim is that the failure of Congress to make the appropriation as stipulated in the contract became a new terminus a quo from which the calculation of interest on everything then due and owing must be calculated.
24
25
In taking up this argument, we should begin with the premise, well established by the authorities, that a recovery of interest against the United States is not authorized under a special act referring to the Court of Claims a suit founded upon a contract with the United States unless the contract or the act expressly authorizes such interest. This is in accord with the general congressional policy as shown in section of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. § , providing that no interest shall be allowed on any claim up to the time of the rendition thereon by the Court of Claims, unless upon a contract expressly stipulating for the payment of interest. Tillson v. United States, Harvey v. United States, L. Ed. 987.
25
26
We have already held, in The Old Settlers Case, supra, and in United States v. Cherokee Nation, supra, that in the past financial dealings between the United States and the Cherokee on debts due from the former to the latter, interest at 5 per cent. until payment was to be allowed as if stipulated. This result followed from a decision by the Senate of the United States acting as umpire between the two parties in 1850. In that capacity it adopted the following resolution:
26
27
'Resolved, that it is the sense of the Senate that interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum should be allowed upon the sums found to be due to the Eastern and Western Cherokees respectively, from the 12th day of June, 1838, until paid.'
27
28
Thus it was that the accountants Slade and Bender reported that interest at 5 per cent. until paid should be allowed the Cherokees, not only on the items which were due in 1850, but also on those which had accrued since, and, by the ratification of their report by both parties, interest thus calculated becomes a stipulated term in respect of the issue before us.
28
29
It is contended, however, by counsel for the Cherokee Nation, that the decision of this court in 1906 so treats the breach of the contract by the government in failing to make the appropriation in as to justify the claim that it was more than a mere continuance of the failure to pay; that it was a new breach of a new contract, requiring interest as upon a new default in a new debt of the sum total of the original claim, with interest added down to .
29
30
We cannot ascribe such an effect of the decision referred to. The chief controversy in that case was as to the liability of the government at all for the removal expenses of the Eastern Cherokees. It was argued on its behalf, as the report of the case in the Court of Claims shows (, that Slade and Bender were merely accountants employed by the government to state the account, and not to pass on the legal validity and effect of the Treaty of and the scope of the settlement evidenced by the appropriation and the signed releases of that the Cherokees were not bound by the report as an account stated or settled, but were given full right by the agreement of to contest its correctness and to resort to court in respect to it; and that the government could not be bound by such a report, in which the accountants exceeded their authority as mere accountants, and exercised their functions as if authorized to act as arbitrators or umpires. This court stated its adverse conclusion on this point, by quoting and approving the language of Chief Justice Nott in the Court of Claims ( at pages , as follows:
30
31
'The court does not intend to imply that when the account of Slade and Bender came into the hands of the Secretary of the Interior he was bound to transmit it to the Cherokee Nation. On the contrary, the Cherokee Nation had not agreed to be bound by the report of the accountants and could not claim that the United States should be. The accountants were but the instrumentality of the United States in making out an account. When it was placed in the Interior Department it was as much within the discretion of the Secretary to accept and adopt it or to remand it for alterations and corrections as a thing could be. He was the representative of the United States under whom the agreement had been made, and he was the authority under which the account had been made out, and when he transmitted it to the Cherokee Nation his transmission was the transmission of the United States. When the account was thus received by the Cherokee Nation (May , the 'twelve months' of the agreement, within which the Nation must consider it and enter suit against the other party in the Court of Claims, began to run, and with the Nation's acceptance of the account (December the session of Congress at which and appropriation should be made became fixed and certain. The Secretary did not recall the account; the United States never rendered another, and the utmost authority which Congress could have exercised, if any, was, at the same session, or certainly within the prescribed 'twelve months,' to have directed the Secretary to withdraw the account and notify the Cherokee Nation that another would be rendered. The action of the Secretary of the Interior, combined with the inaction of Congress to direct anything to the contrary, makes this provision of the agreement final and conclusive. The Cherokee Nation has parted with the land, has lost the time within which it might have appealed to the courts, and has lost the right to bring the items which it regards as incorrectly or unjustly disallowed to judicial arbitrament, and the United States are placed in the position of having broken and evaded the letter and spirit of their agreement.' All this, however, was directed to the question of the liability of the United States to pay the principal debt. The court then proceeded to find the interest due as directed in the Slade and Bender account without any suggestion of a rest for interest in 1905, or anything other than simple interest at 5 per cent. until paid.
31
32
When we consider the rule requiring an express provision of contract or statute to justify the imposition of interest in adjudicating any claim against the United States, we can find nothing in the circumstances of this case to increase the interest as adjudged. The additional interest now claimed is sought really as damages for the delay of Congress in appropriating the sum due in 1895 as the United States promised in the agreement. But the rule as to interest against the United States does not allow us to adjudge interest as damages at all. Congress must expressly provide for it or the contract must so provide. The only contractual obligation here is for simple 5 per cent. interest until payment.
32
33
What the appellant here seeks is compound interest; that is, interest on interest from until now. The general rule, even as between private persons, is that, in the absence of a contract therefor or some statute, compound interest is not allowed to be computed upon a debt. Whitcomb v. Harris, Bradley v. Merrill, Ellis v. Sullivan, Tisbury v. Vineyard Haven Water Co., Lewin v. Folsom, Wallace v. Glaser Am. St. Rep. Blanchard v. Dominion National Bank, A. L. R. 78; Finger v. McCaughey, Cullen v. Whitham, In view of the care with which Congress and this court, in interpretation of the legislative will, have limited the collection of simple interest against the government, a fortiori must compound interest be denied to appellant, unless provision therefor is made in the contract of or in the statute of authorizing this suit, and it is to be found in neither.
33
34
Further support for the claim of the appellant is said to be found in the sixth article of the agreement, quoted above, in the language, 'so long as the money or any part of it shall remain in the Treasury of the United States after this agreement shall have become effective, such sums so left in the Treasury of the United States shall bear interest at rate of 5 per cent. per annum, payable semiannually.' It is said that this should be construed to refer not only to the balance unpaid of the $but also to the money on the old claims found to be due under the agreement, because payment of the latter was part of the consideration for the land. A careful examination of the sixth article shows that this clause referred only to the new money consideration to be paid, and really only to the part of that which, after it fell due and was ready for payment, should be voluntarily left in the Treasury by the Cherokee Nation. It did not even refer to the originally deferred payments because those payments were to bear only four per cent. interest. In any view, it did not and could not refer to amounts due on past account, because at the time the agreement of was made they were not fixed in amount and awaited a possible adjudication to determine them, and full treatment of them was given in article 4 of the agreement. The sixth article did not apply to them at all.
34
35
It is further argued that the payment of compound interest is to be supported here under the provisions of the Treaty of July which reads as follows:
35
36
'All funds now due the Nation, or that may hereafter accrue from the sale of their lands by the United States as hereinbefore provided for, shall be invested in United States registered stocks at their current value, and the interest on all said funds shall be paid semiannually on the order of the Cherokee Nation.' And by section of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St. s re-enacting section 2 of the Act of Congress of September which provides:
36
37
'All funds held in trust by the United States, and the annual interest accruing thereon, when not otherwise required by treaty, shall be invested in stocks of the United States, bearing a rate of interest not less than five per centum per annum.'
37
38
It is urged that the largest itme of $was taken out of a $trust fund held by the United States for the benefit of the Cherokees, and therefore that it should be treated as if it were always in the Treasury of the United States, held in trust for the Indians, and as if the United States had collected the interest thereon out of the invested stocks, and had refused to pay it over as annuities to the Indians. This claim proves too much. It would require compound interest brought about by annual or semiannual rests for near a century, on amount that the Solicitor General suggests would be equal to the national debt. The argument is shown to be wholly without support in the circumstance that the Cherokees and the United States, by the resolution of the Senate in 1850, agreed upon the interest for such debts as that of 5 per cent. until paid. Moreover the ratification by the Cherokees of the Slade and Bender report foreclosed any such claim.
38
39
After the judgment was rendered in by this court, affirming that of the Court of Claims, the Treasury had some difficulty in deciding how the interest was to be calculated on the amounts declared in the judgment. We have no doubt that the judgment should have been paid in accordance with its exact terms, namely, with simple interest down to the time of actual payment, and that the intervention of the judgment of made no difference in the calculation of the interest. This is the necessary effect of the judgment.
39
40
The Treasury was troubled by the provision of Act Sept. (Comp. St. § , which provides as follows:
40
41
'That hereafter it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to certify to Congress for appropriation only such judgments of the Court of Claims as are not to be appealed, or such appealed cases as shall have been decided by the Supreme Court to be due and payable. And on judgments in favor of claimants which have been appealed by the United States and affirmed by the Supreme Court, interest, at the rate of four per centum per annum, shall be allowed and paid from the date of filing the transcript of judgment in the Treasury Department up to and including the date of the mandate of affirmance by the Supreme Court: Provided, that in no case shall interest be allowed after the term of the Supreme Court at which said judgment was affirmed.'
41
42
It is quite clear that the statute applies where judgment against the United States bear no interest, and certainly not to one in which the judgment itself provides for a certain rate of interest after its entry. The above statute was framed in order to impose a penalty on the United States for its unsuccessful effort by appeal to defeat the judgment against it. It only allows interest pending the appeal from the date of filing the transcript in the Treasury Department to the date of the mandate of affirmance. The Treasury Department seems to have applied this statute with respect to all the four items of the judgment of .
42
43
By the Act of June Congress made appropriation for the payment of the judgment of the Court of Claims, principal and interest, as follows:
43
44
'To pay the judgment rendered by the Court of Claims on May eighteenth, nineteen hundred and five, in consolidated causes numbered twenty-three thousand one hundred and ninety-nine, The Cherokee Nation versus the United States; numbered twenty-three thousand two hundred and fourteen. The Eastern Cherokees versus The United States; and numbered twenty-three thousand two hundred and twelve, The Eastern and Emigrant Cherokees versus The United States, aggregating a principal sum of one million one hundred and thirty-four thousand two hundred and forty-eight dollars and twenty-three cents, as therein set forth, with interest upon the several items of judgment at five per centum, one million one hundred and thirty-four thousand two hundred and forty-eight dollars and twenty-three cents, together with such additional sum as may be necessary to pay interest, as authorized by law.'
44
45
This act was further amended by the Act of March as follows:
45
46
'That the general deficiency appropriation act of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and six, so far as the same provides for the payment of item two of the judgment of the Court of Claims of May eighteenth, nineteen hundred and five, in favor of the Eastern Cherokees, shall be so construed as to carry interest on said item two up to such time as the roll of the individual beneficiaries entitled to share in said judgment shall be finally approved by the Court of Claims, and for the payment of said interest a sufficient sum is hereby appropriated.'
46
47
Then by section 18 of the Act of June Congress provided for the payment of certain interest on items 1 and 4 of the judgment. The provision in this section as to item 1 seems to have been largely an overpayment. That as to item 4 seems also to have involved a considerable overpayment though it also included 10 years' interest due on the principal under the judgment which by the government's error was not embraced in the payment under the act of .
47
48
The sum of all payment actually made under the judgment of was as follows:
48
49
 On July 2, 1906, to the Secretary of the
 Interior on account of said item 
 On the same date on account of item 
 On the same date on account of item to the attorneys for the
 Eastern Cherokees and the Eastern
 Emigrant Cherokees, fees amounting to...................... 
 On November 3, 1906, to the attorneys
 for the Cherokee Nation on account of
 item 2, fees amounting to.................................. 
 On various dates after July 2, 1906, and
 before final distribution of the fund
 arising from item 2, to Guion Miller
 for fees and expenses the sum of........................... 
 On and after March 15, 1910, to Guion
 Miller for per capita distribution
 among the Cherokees entitled to share
 in the fund the sum of...................................

 interest on item 4, pursuant to the Act
 of June 30, 1919............................................ 21,502 86
 
 On or about August 7, 1919, to the
 Secretary of the Interior as additional
 interest on item 1, pursuant to the said
 Act of June 30, 1919......................................... 2,185 72
 ---------
 Making a total sum, principals and
 interest of............................................. $4
49
50
The delay in the payment of the largest ites was due to the desire to comply with the ruling of the Court of Claims, concurred in by this court, that the money of the large claim should be distributed to the individual members of the Eastern Cherokees according to rolls to be made up of those individuals. U. S. This is what led to the amendment of .
50
51
It is quite clear that the mistake made by the Treasury, and by Congress, too, in attempting to carry out the judgment of this court, was in assuming first that 4 per cent. should be allowed on the total of all items and interest between the date of filing the transcript of the judgment in the Treasury Department and the date of the mandate of arrirmance by the Supreme Court, as already pointed out. A further mistake was made in calculating interest at 5 per cent. after the date of affirmance by this court on the total of the judgment and the interest until final payment. It should have been confined to interest on the principal sums. The eighth finding of the Court of Claims shows in more or less detail how the interest was calculated. The methods adopted we have already criticized. The Solicitor General in his brief makes it evident that in the case of no one of the four items is the amount which has been actually paid less than that which should have been paid down to the day of payment, in accordance with the judgment, including the principal and 5 per cent. simple interest to the date of payment. There is no attempt on the part of the appellant to question the demonstration of this fact. The truth is that the errors in the calculation increased by a substantial sum the amounts which under the judgment should have been paid. As this was more favorable than it should have been to the Cherokees, they can not complain. On this appeal, under the act of and in compliance with its requirement, we hold that there is no more interest due to the Cherokees beyond that which they have already received. The government is not in a position, in view of the fact that the errors referred to have been embodied in legislation, and the overpayments have been made by direction of Congress, to seek to recover them back. Indeed it has not attempted to do so.
51
52
The judgment of the Court of Claims is affirmed.

270 U.S. 496
LUCKETT
v.
DELPARK, Inc., et al.
Argued March 16, 1926.
1
Philip A. Luckett is a citizen of Connecticut. He brought this bill in equity in the District Court of the United States for the District of New Jersey against Delpark, a corporation of New York, and against Parker, Ford & Dick, a corporation, formerly known as the Luckett Company, organized in the state of Maryland. Appearing for the purpose of the motion only, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, because the court was without jurisdiction to entertain the bill. The certificate by the District Court shows its dismissal on that ground September 17, 1924. This appeal was allowed November 24, 1924, so that it is maintainable under section of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. § , in accordance with the saving provision of section 14 of the Act of February .
1
2
Section 51 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. § provides that, where the jurisdiction is founded on the fact that the action is between citizens of different states, suits shall be brought only in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant. The requisite diverse citizenship between the plaintiff and the defendants exists in this suit, but the district of New Jersey is not the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendants, and against defendants' objection jurisdiction on that ground cannot be sustained.
2
3
The plaintiff asserts that jurisdiction exists as of a suit under the patent laws under Judicial Code, § 24, par. 7, section 48, and section . Section 48 provides that:
3
4
'In suits brought for the infringement of letters patent the District Courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction, in law or in equity, in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant, or in any district in which the defendant, whether a person, partnership, or corporation, shall have committed acts of infringement and have a regular and established place of business.'
4
5
The question in this case, then, is whether, it being averred that the defendants regularly do business in New Jersey, and have made and sold there the patented articles referred to in the bill, its allegations make the suit one arising under the patent laws.
5
6
The bill shows that two patents were issued to Luckett, one on November and the other on October for a method of making undergarments known as union suits. The later patent, No. is averred to be the generic and the broader invention, while the earlier patent, No. is a specific and narrower one. After the later patent was applied for, before it was granted, Luckett gave a nonexclusive license for manufacture and sale of the garments under it to the Delpark corporation. This reserved to Luckett a royalty on all garments manufactured and sold under it, the licensee covenanting to give access to its books of account. A supplementary agreement made the license exclusive. Later Luckett gave to the other defendant, Parker, Ford & Dick, and assignment of the letters patent No. under which a particular union suit, known as the 'My Pal' suit, is made, with conditions subsequent that the assignee should pay certain royalties, should keep the accounts open for inspection, and should push vigorously the sale of 'My Pal' suits, and with a provision that, if any condition subsequent failed, the title to the letters patent assigned should revert to Luckett, on his giving the assignee 30 days' notice in writing of his election to resume title. All the contracts of license and assignment made by the plaintiff with each of the defendants are attached to the bill as exhibits.
6
7
The averments of the bill are that Delpark, Incorporated, has acquired control of the stock of the Parker, Ford & Dick corporation, and the defendants are acting together; that the Delpark corporation refuses to pay to Luckett any royalties due under its exclusive license of the generic patent; that the Parker, Ford & Dick corporation refuses to pay any royalties under plaintiff's assignment to it of the specific patent, and refuses to push the sale of 'My Pal' suits; that this refusal is to prevent competition of the 'My Pal' suits with the Delpark suits, and thus deprives plaintiff of royalties on the 'My Pal' suits. The plaintiff avers that on November 27, 1918, by notice in writing he cancelled his assignment to the Parker, Ford & Dick corporation, for failure of condition subsequent, and resumed his title to letters patent No. 
7
8
The seventeenth paragraph in the bill, and the only one which uses the word 'infringement,' is as follows:
8
9
'(VII) And your orator further shows unto your honors that Delpark, Incorporated, is a large concern with substantial capital, and ever since the issue of letters patent No. on November 12, 1918, has been actively engaged in the manufacture and sale of the Delpark garment, so called, which infringes the claims of the said letters patent, and also the claims of letters patent No. and that large numbers of the said garment have been made and sold upon which royalties are now due to your orator, the amount of which he is wholly unable to state with definiteness, but which is far larger than $ exclusive of interest and costs, and that, though often requested as hereinbefore set out, no accounting has ever been had between your orator and Delpark, Incorporated, or Parker, Ford & Dick, Inc., either as to royalties due or as to damages for failure to observe the contract to exploit the 'My Pal' garment.'
9
10
The plaintiff sets out 13 prayers for equitable relief. He asks that the defendants file statements of the garments made and sold under both patents, containing retail prices at which the garments were sold, in order to show the royalties due; also a statement of the orders received for the 'My Pal' garments, but not filled, with prices, to show the royalties lost, and that they be compelled to permit access to their books of account. He further prays that the Parker, Ford & Dick corporation be required to execute a formal reassignment of letters patent No. to the complainant, so as to remove the cloud from his title to that patent, and that an order issue canceling the licenses and agreements made with both defendants. He prays for damages for suppressing the 'My Pal' garment, and the failure properly to exploit it as agreed.
10
11
In prayer, J, the plaintiff asks that a preliminary injunction issue against both defendants to prevent their making sale or delivery of the so-called Delpark garment, or the so-called 'My Pal' garment, or any other garment infringing the claims of the two letters patent of the plaintiff, until further order of court. By prayer K, a similar permanent injunction is asked. There is a prayer for an order sending the cause to a master to take and state the account of profits and damages, both as to royalties due and accrued, and as to damages for suppression of the 'My Pal' garment, and to report the same to the court.
11
12
We do not think that this suit arises under the patent laws. Its main and declared purpose is to enforce the rights of the plaintiff under his contracts with defendants for royalties and for pushing the sales of 'My Pal' garments. In addition he seeks the reconveyance of one patent on forfeiture for failure of condition to remove a cloud on his title and a cancellation of all agreements of license of the other for their breach in order presumably that, unembarrassed by his assignment and licenses, he may enjoin future infringement.
12
13
It is a general rule that a suit by a patentee for royalties under a license or assignment granted by him, or for any remedy in respect of a contract permitting use of the patent, is not a suit under the patent laws of the United States, and cannot be maintained in a federal court as such. Wilson v. Sandford, Brown v. Shannon, Hartell v. Tilghman, Albright v. Teas, L. Ed. 295; Dale Tile Manufacturing Co. v. Hyatt, L. Ed. 683; Marsh v. Nichols, Shepard & Co., Briggs v. United Shoe Machinery Co., L. Ed. 138.
13
14
In Wilson v. Sandford, supra, a bill in equity was filed in a federal Circuit Court setting forth complainant's ownership of a patent, an assignment to defendants of a license in consideration of five promissory notes, with a condition of reversion to complainant on failure to pay any note. The bill averred that the first two notes were not paid, insisted that the license was forfeited by the failure and the licensor was fully reinvested at law and in equity with all his original rights, that the defendants were using the patented machine and were infringing the patent, prayed an account of profits since forfeiture, a temporary and permanent injunction, and a reinvestiture of title in the complainant. On demurrer, the bill was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction as not arising under the patent laws. Chief Justice Taney, speaking for the court, said:
14
15
'The rights of the parties depend altogether upon common-law and equity principles. The object of the bill is to have this contract set aside and declared to be forfeited, and the prayer is 'that the appellant's reinvestiture of title to the license granted to the appellees, by reason of the forfeiture of the contract, may be sanctioned by the court,' and for an injunction. But the injunction he asks for is in consequence of the decree of the court sanctioning the forfeiture. He alleges no ground for an injunction unless the contract is set aside; and if the case made in the bill was a fit one for relief in equity, it is very clear that whether the contract ought to be declared forfeited or not, in a court of chancery, depended altogether upon the rules and principles of equity, and in no degree whatever upon any act of Congress concerning patent rights.'
15

The bill in the present case cannot in any respect be distinguished from that in Wilson v. Sandford, as this language of the opinion shows. But counsel for the appellant here insists that a new and more liberal rule has been adopted by this court in later cases, and that the time has now come for recognizing it by taking what he calls the last step.
16
17
In the common feature of Wilson v. Sandford and the case before us, jurisdiction falls because the complainant in his bill seeks forfeiture of licensed rights in equity before he can rely on the patent laws to enjoin infringement of his patent rights and obtain damages therefor. There has been no variation from the authority and effect of the case cited on this point. New Marshall Co. v. Marshall Engine Co., L. Ed. 513; White v. Lee (C. C.) Adams v. Meyrose (C. C.) Standard Dental Mfg. Co. v. National Tooth Co. (C. C.) Atherton Machine Company v. Atwood-Morrison Co., approved in Excelsior Wooden Pipe Co. v. Pacific Bridge Co., infra, at page Victor Talking Machine Co. v. The Fair, Comptograph Co. v. Burroughs Adding Machine Co. (C. C.) American Graphophone Co. v. Victor Talking Machine Co. (C. C.) Lowry v. Hert (C. C. A.) .

The cases cited as qualifying Wilson v. Sandford are White v. Rankin, Excelsior Wooden Pipe Co. v. Pacific Bridge Co., Henry v. Dick Co., Ann. Cas. The Fair v. Kohler Die Co., L. Ed. 716; Healy v. Sea Gull Specialty Co., and Geneva Furniture Co. v. Karpen, We think that none of these cases shakes the authority of Wilson v. Sandford upon the point here in question, or can be used to sustain the present bill. The case which has been 'blown upon' is that of Hartell v. Tilghman, supra, in which the opinion of the court was delivered by Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for himself and three other justices, and in which Mr. Justice Bradley announced a dissenting opinion in which two others concurred. That case was a suit in equity in which the complainant set up a process patent and complained that defendants were infringing by using the process without license and prayed an injunction and a decree for profits and damages. The bill further averred that negotiations had been had between the parties looking to a license, beginning with a verbal agreement by complainant that he should put up machinery for use of defendants in their shop in using the patent, and that thereafter defendants should take a license on certain well-understood conditions, that complainant under the verbal agreement put up the machinery and was paid for it and received royalties under it for use of the patent for some months, that on tender of contract forms for the license defendants refused to sign, and that on such refusal complainant forbade defendants to use the process and brought the suit. The majority relied on Wilson v. Sandford, and held that the suit was not under patent laws; that complainant could not himself rescind the verbal contract, treat it as a nullity and charge the defendants as infringers, but must preliminarily seek rescission in a court of equity. Mr. Justice Bradley's view was that the plaintiff in his bill had chosen to place himself on the infringement of his patent as his sole ground, and that by anticipation of the defense and his answer to it in his bill, as allowed by equity pleading he did not change its nature.
18

In White v. Rankin, supra, it was held that a bill in equity for the infringement of letters patent for an invention in the usual form, which did not mention or refer to any contract with the defendants for the use of the patent, could not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, because the defendants in a plea set up an agreement in writing between the plaintiffs and one of the defendants to assign to him an interest in the patent on certain conditions which he alleged he had performed, and certain other matters which it was alleged had given the defendant the right to make, use and sell the patented invention. The plea being overruled and the answer filed, a stipulation in writing was entered into, admitting that the defendants had made and sold the articles containing the patented inventions, and that a certain written agreement had been made to the purport before mentioned. The decision of the court was that the jurisdiction was established by the averments of the bill, and that the defense constituted a mere issue as to the title to the patent, but could not oust the jurisdiction which rested on the averments of the bill.
19
20
In Excelsior Wooden Pipe Co. v. Pacific Bridge Co., supra, and exclusive licensee filed a bill against the patentee and another party, to whom the patentee had granted a conflicting license. This court held that the patent jurisdiction of the court was not ousted by reason of allegations in the answer that the plaintiff had forfeited all his rights under the license thought his failure to comply with its terms and conditions, by reason of which the license had been revoked by the patentee. Complainant was an exclusive licensee, which sought damages for infringement of its license and the patent against the patentee and one to whom he had granted a subsequent and conflicting license. In such a case the licensee had the right to sue the patentee on the patent. Littlefield v. Perry, Independent Wireless Telegraph Co. v. Radio Corporation of America, opinion January 11, 1926. The case was held to be a suit for infringement under the patent laws, jurisdiction in which was not ousted because the patentee had led a third person to infringe the patent and the first license.
20
21
In Henry v. Dick Co., supra, the patentee for a kind of ink filed a bill for infringement against the users of his patent whom the bill showed to be using the ink in connection with unpatented supplies not made by the patentee in violation of a license from the patentee limited to its use with its supplies. The case has been since reversed on the merits (Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., L. R. A. Ann. Cas. , but not on the point of jurisdiction. It was objected that the suit was not a suit under the patent laws but a suit on the license contract. It was held that the patentee might waive the contract and sue on the tort of infringement, that jurisdiction must depend on the remedy it chose and sought in its bill, and that, as the patentee had neither sued on the broken contract of license nor asked to have it forfeited by the court, the jurisdiction under the patent laws was not ousted.
21
22
In The Fair v. Kohler Die & Specialty Co., supra, the Kohler Company brought a bill in equity to enjoin The Fair from making and vending certain devices and selling them at less than $each, and asked an account and triple damages. The bill alleged that plaintiff had the sole and exclusive right to make and sell devices and that the defendant had full notice thereof and was selling the same without license from the plaintiff. It alleged that the plaintiff, when it sold, imposed the condition that the good should not be sold at less than $ and attached to the goods a notice to that effect, and that any sale in violation of that condition would be an infringement. It further averred that the defendant obtained a stock of the devices with notice of the conditions, and sold them at $each, in infringement of the plaintiff's right under the patent. The defendant pleaded specially that he had purchased these devices from a jobber, who had paid full price to the plaintiff, and that there was no question arising under the patent or other laws of the United States, and that the court had no jurisdiction of the case. The case came on for hearing on the plea. This court held that on the bill the plaintiff made a case under the patent laws, in that it set up the patent, charged infringement, and sought triple damages, and that, in showing later in the bill that the infringement consisted in a sale at a less price than that which it had authorized in an admitted license, it did not oust the court of jurisdiction, because it might appear upon further hearing of the cause on its merits that the restriction of the license upon which the claim of infringement was based was not valid.
22
23
In Healy v. Sea Gull Specialty Co., supra, the bill alleged ownership of the exclusive right to make and use box-making machines and sell boxes containing the patented improvements. It further alleged that the defendant was infringing the patents, and would continue to do so unless restrained. Anticipating a defense, the plaintiff set out a license to the defendant, a breach of its conditions, and a termination of the same. It added that the license contained a stipulation that, in case of any suit for infringement, the measure of recovery should be the same as the royalty agreed upon for the use of the inventions, and another for the return of the machines let to the defendant while the license was in force. The bill prayed for an injunction against making, using, or selling the boxes or machines, for an account of profits received by reason of the infringement, for triple the damages measured as above stated, and for the surrender of the machines. In sustaining the jurisdiction as arising under the patent laws, the court used these words:
23
24
'It may be that the reasoning of The Fair v. Kohler Die & Specialty Co. (L. Ed. 716), is more consistent with that of Mr. Justice Bradley's dissent in Hartell v. Tilghman, a decision since explained and limited (White v. Rankin (), than with that of the majority, but it is the deliberate judgment of the court and governs this case. As stated there, the plaintiff is absolute master of what jurisdiction he will appeal to; and if he goes to the District Court for infringement of a patent, unless the claim is frivolous or a pretense, the District Court will have jurisdiction on that ground, even though the course of the subsequent pleadings reveals other more serious disputes. Excelsior Wooden Pipe Co. v. Pacific Bridge Co. (. Jurisdiction generally depends upon the case made and relief demanded by the plaintiff, and as it cannot be helped, so it cannot be defeated, by the replication to an actual or anticipated defense contained in what used to be the charging part of the bill. For the same reason it does not matter whether the validity of the patent is admitted or denied.
24
25
'As appears from the statement of it, the plaintiffs' case arose under the patent law. It was not affected by the fact that the plaintiffs relied upon a contract as fixing the mode of estimating damages or that they sought a return of patented machines to which if there was no license they were entitled. These were incidents. The essential features were the allegation of an infringement and prayers for an injunction, an account of profits and triple damages-the characteristic forms of relief granted by the patent law. The damages were grounded on the infringement, and the contract was relied upon only as furnishing the mode in which they should be ascertained.'
25
26
In Geneva Furniture Co. v. Karpen, supra, the patentee charged the defendants in his bill in equity with contributing to the infringement by wrongfully persuading the licensees of the complainant to use the patent in circumstances not authorized by the license; second, with wrongfully procuring such licensees to violate their licenses in particulars not bearing on the charge of infringement; and third, with refusing to perform stipulations by which defendants agreed to assign other patents to plaintiff. Jurisdiction of the court under the patent laws, which was the sole basis of jurisdiction, was sustained for the first branch of the suit, because the claim of infringement was not frivolous but substantial, and there was jurisdiction, whether the claim ultimately was held good or bad. The remainder of the bill was found not sustainable as arising under the patent laws, because based on contract, and while, under the equity practice, the parts of the bill were properly joined, such practice must yield to a jurisdictional statute, and the bill was dismissed as to its second and third branches.
26
27
The result of these cases is that a federal district court is held to have jurisdiction of a suit by a patentee for an injunction against infringement and for profits and damages, even though in anticipation of a defense of a license or authority to use the patent, the complainant includes in his bill averments intended to defeat such a defense. If these averments do not defeat such defense, the patentee will lose his case on the merits, but the court's jurisdiction under the patent laws is not ousted. The error in Hartell v. Tilghman, supra, was in denying jurisdiction under the patent laws when the patentee based his action broadly on his patent and averment of infringement seeking injunction and damages. His averments, intended to constitute a reply to the anticipated defense that the defendant was a licensee, did not change the nature of his declared choice of a suit under the patent laws. This, under the principle now established by the later cases, and especially The Fair v. Kohler Die & Specialty Co. and Healy v. Sea Gull Specialty Co. is clear. But the present qualification of the Hartell Case does not affect the principle, laid down in Wilson v. Sandford, that where a patentee complainant makes his suit one for recovery of royalties under a contract of license or assignment, or for damages for a breach of its covenants, or for a specific performance thereof, or asks the aid of the court in declaring a forfeiture of the license, or in restoring an unclouded title to the patent, he does not give the federal District Court jurisdiction of the cause as one arising under the patent laws. Now may he confer it in such a case by adding to his bill an averment that after the forfeiture shall be declared, or the title to the patent shall be restored, he fears the defendant will infringe, and therefore asks an injunction to prevent it. That was Wilson v. Sandford. If in that case the patentee complainant had based his action on his patent right and had sued for infringement, and by anticipation of a defense of the assignment had alleged a forfeiture by his own declaration without seeking aid of the court, jurisdiction under the patent laws would have attached, and he would have had to meet the claim by the defendant that forfeiture of the license or assignment and restoration of title could not be had except by a decree of a court, which, if sustained, would have defeated his prayer for an injunction on the merits. But when the patentee exercises his choice, and bases his action on the contract, and seeks remedies thereunder, he may not give the case a double aspect, so to speak, and make it a patent case conditioned on his securing equitable relief as to the contract. That is the principle settled by Wilson v. Sandford, and is still the law.
27
28
It is true that in Mr. Justice Bradley's dissenting opinion, in Hartell v. Tilghman, supra, page he says, in reference to Wilson v. Sandford, that if the question were a new one he would think that it would not oust the jurisdiction under the patent laws for the complainant to join in a bill for infringement, as ancillary to the relief sought, an application to avoid an inequitable license. But no subsequent case has gone so far, and we are not disposed to depart from the rule of Wilson v. Sandford, whatever might be our conclusion if it were a new question. Moreover, the bill in this case, as we have already fully pointed out, is really not based on threatened infringement, but on the contracts, and its reference to infringements is inadequate even to present a bill in the form suggested by Mr. Justice Bradley.
28
29
The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.

LIBERATO et al.
v.
ROYER et al.
Argued March 15, 1926.
1
This is a claim for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act of Pennsylvania (Pa. St. et seq.). It is for the death of the claimants' son in the employment of the defendants, without negligence or fault on the part of the latter, so far as appears. The son died unmarried and without issue, and the claimants, the plaintiffs in error, were wholly dependent upon him for support; but they were Italians living in Italy. The Compensation Board in obedience to a decision of the Court of Common Pleas awarded $ and the award was affirmed by that Court. The judgment was reversed by the Superior Court on the ground that the statute expressly provided that 'alien * * * parents * * * not residents of the United States, shall not be entitled to any compensation,' section , and that the Treaty of with Italy did not cover the case. 81 Pa. Super. Ct. The judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court on the opinion below. As the plaintiffs contended that the Treaty with Italy invalidated the above clause of the State law and gave them a right to recover, a writ of error was allowed.

'The citizens of each of the High Contracting Parties shall receive in the States and Territories of the other the most constant security and protection for their persons and property and for their rights, including that form of protection granted by any State or national law which establishes a civil responsibility for injuries or for death caused by negligence or fault and gives to relatives or heirs of the injured party a right of action, which right shall not be restricted on account of the nationality of said relatives or heirs; and shall enjoy in this respect the same rights and privileges as are or shall be granted to nationals, provided that they submit themselves to the conditions imposed on the latter.' .
2
3
This amendment was suggested by the decision in Maiorano v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., that under the laws of Pennsylvania a non-resident alien widow could not recover for the death of her husband caused by the defendant's negligence, although citizens of the State were given a remedy. Following this suggestion, the words of the amendment, if taken literally, deal only with death caused by negligence or fault. It is natural that they should be limited in that way. Apart from those States, of which Pennsylvania is not one, that very recently have substituted for the common law a general system of quasi insurance liability without fault is exceptional and usually has not been imposed for death except as the result of a voluntary arrangement. The statutes of Pennsylvania accord with this view of the Treaty. They give to alien nonresident dependent parents the same right to recover damages for death due to fault that they give to citizens and residents. Then the Compensation Act offers a plan different from the common law and the workman is free not to come in under it. If he does, of course all benefits dependent on the new arrangement are matters of agreement and statutory consequences of agreement and cannot be carried further than the contract and statute go. One of those benefits is compensation irrespective of the cause of death, but it is confined to residents. Whether the workman's election to take advantage of the statute could be made a bar to a suit by his parents alleging a wrong is not before us here, but the right to recover without alleging fault depends on the terms of the Act.
3
4
We are of opinion that the Treaty was construed rightly by the Courts below. Were it otherwise, and if the excluding clause of the Compensation Act were held void, the question would arise whether the general grant to parents in the plaintiffs' situation could be extended to cover those whom it excluded in terms or whether, notwithstanding a saving clause, section , the whole grant would fail on the ground that it could not be maintained as made and could not be assumed to go farther. But treaties are not likely to intermeddle with the consequences of voluntary arrangements, if the right is given, as here it was given by other statutes, to sue for death wrongfully caused, at least unless those arrangements made by third persons take away that right. It looks somewhat as if in the first stages of this case that right was supposed to be taken away; but, if so, the question was not saved, and the only question before us is whether the plaintiffs can recover under the Compensation Act, not whether they could recover for a wrongful death, which was not proved or even alleged.

270 U.S. 539
GREAT NORTHERN RY. CO.
v.
REED et ux.
Submitted October 15, 1925.
1
This was a suit in a state court in Whatcom county, Wash., against the Great Northern Railway Company to have it declared a trustee for the plaintiff of the title to a quarter-quarter section of land, theretofore patented to it by the United States, and to compel a conveyance in discharge of the trust. The company in its answer denied much that was alleged in the complaint and sought a decree quieting the title. On the trial the plaintiff prevalied, and the Supreme Court of the state affirmed the decree. Reed v. Great Northern R. Co., Wash. 
1
2
The suit involved a conflict between a railroad lieu selection and an asserted homestead settlement. The evidence on the material issues was so direct and free from contradiction that the real controversy was over the application of federal statutes to facts conceded or definitely established.
2
3
The Great Northern Railway Company is the successor in interest of the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railway Company, which constructed and put in operation certain lines of railroad in the state of Minnesota and the territory of Dakota, and thereby became entitled under an early land grant by Congress to particular lands along those lines. The land officers of the United States denied the company's right to the lands along the lines in Dakota, and treated those lands as open to settlement, entry, and disposal under the public land laws. In this court pronounced the action of the land officers erroneous, and sustained the right of the railway company to the Dakota lands. St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Ry. Co. v. Phelps, In the meantime many of the lands had come to be occupied and improved by persons who had made entries or purchases of them as public lands under the ruling of the land officers. To correct the resulting wrong to both the company and the individual claimants, Congress by the Act of August requested the company to relinquish its right to such lands, to the end that the United States might invest the individual claimants with a good title, and declared that the company, on executing the relinquishment, should be entitled to select and receive other lands in equal quantity. The company complied with that request, and thus became entitled as matter of legal right, and not of grace, to select and receive other lands conformably to the terms of the act. Shortly described, the act (section 2) provided that the selections might be made within any of the states 'into or through which the railway owned by said railway company runs'-Washington being one-from the nonmineral, unreserved public lands therein, 'to which no adverse right or claim shall have attached or have been initiated at the time of the making of such selection'; that not exceeding acres should be selected in a single body; that the mode of selection should be by filing descriptive lists in the land offices for the districts where the selected tracts lay and paying the usual fees of the local land officers; that selection might be made of tracts while yet unsurveyed, in which event they should be described in the list with a reasonable degree of certainty,1 and should be designated according to the survey in a supplemental list within three months after the plat of the survey was filed in the local office; and that on the approval of any list by the Secretary of the Interior2 the tracts selected therein should be patented to the company.
3
4
The railway company selected the quarterquarter in question May 5, 1902, while it was unsurveyed, by filing a suitable list in the proper local land office and paying the officers' fees, and it duly supplemented that list by another designating the tract according to the survey within a few days after the plat of the survey was filed in the local office, which was on February 6, 1907. The lists were transmitted by the local officers to the General Land Office and laid before the Secretary of the Interior. He approved them, and on April 13, 1908, a patent was issued to the company.
4
5
The tract was open to selection and was duly selected and rightly patented, if at the time of the selection-May a homestead claim to the land had not been initiated by the acts about to be stated. The plaintiff contended that such a claim had been initiated, and the courts below so held.
5
6
In September or October, 1901, W. J. Tincker, who possessed the qualifications named in the homestead law, went to the quarter section which includes this quarter-quarter, blazed a line around the larger tract, and posted notices at its four corners declaring that he claimed it as a homestead. He was there on that occasion two or three hours. In March,3 1902, he went to the quarter section again, blazed a trial from an adjacent stream to the nearest corner, cut a few poles, and with these laid what appeared to be a cabin foundation two or three poles high. The trial did not touch the quarter-quarter here in question, nor was the pole foundation placed on it. Tincker was there on that occasion for a longer time than before, probably the greater part of a working day. That is all that was done by him prior to the company's selection. Thereafter he went to the quarter section once or twice a year, usually on hunting trips, but did nothing there beyond renewing his notices at the corners. In August, 1906, he sold his so-called possessory claim and improvements. When he first went to the land, and continuously to the time he sold, he was residing, with his wife and children, at Maple Falls, a few miles from the land, and was maintaining a home there. At the trial he was a witness for the plaintiff, and testified that his intention throughout that period was 'to hold' the quarter section, 'expecting some day to go up there and live on it.'
6
7
Tincker sold to W. M. Smithey, who three months later sold to the plaintiff. The last was the only one of the three who made any attempt at establishing a residence on the quarter section. In November, 1906, he did establish a residence on a part of it not here in question, and after the survey he sought and secured a homestead entry on that part at the local land office. He also sought to have the part here in question included in that entry, but failed. He had no right to have it included unless Tincker's acts prior to the company's selection amounted to the initiation of a homestead claim and thereby excepted the tract from the class of lands open to selection.
7
8
In the company's selection list and supporting affidavit nothing was said about Tincker's acts, not improbably because the selecting agent knew nothing about them, and found nothing on or in the vicinity of the quarter-quarter indicative of a homestead settlement or occupancy. When the plaintiff, in 1907, applied to make his homestead entry and to include this quarter-quarter therein, he based his application on his own settlement in November, 1906, and said nothing about a prior claim by Tincker. That was the situation when the patent issued to the company. Afterwards the plaintiff requested that a suit be brought by the United States to cancel the patent on the grounds that the company in making its selection had not disclosed Tincker's acts, and that the land officers issued the patent without knowledge of those acts; but the Secretary of the Interior declined to recommend such a suit. The plaintiff brought the present suit in his own right in 1919-11 years after the issue of the patent, during all of which the company had been regularly paying state and county taxes on the tract.
8
9
The homestead law-putting aside special provisions without bearing here-accords to every person of stated qualifications the privilege of acquiring title to a quarter section, or less, of 'unappropriated public lands' by settling thereon and continuously residing on, improving and cultivating the same for a prescribed period. The original law was confined to surveyed lands, and required that the claims be initiated by an entry made at the local land office, which was to be followed within a reasonable time by actual settlement, residence, etc. Act May Rev. Stat. §§ 2289, 2290, as amended by Act March (Comp. St. §§ . Afterwards a provision was added permitting claims to be initiated, as respects either surveyed or unsurveyed lands, by settlement, and providing, where that was done, that record entry should be sought within three months after settlement if the land was surveyed, or, if unsurveyed, within a like period after the survey was made and the plat was filed in the local office. Act of May (Comp. St. § 4538). The term 'settlement' is used as comprehending acts done on the land by way of establishing or preparing to establish an actual personal residence-going thereon and, with reasonable diligence, arranging to occupy it as a home to the exclusion of one elsewhere. The law makes it plain that there must be a definite purpose 'in good faith to obtain a home' by proceeding 'faithfully and honestly' to comply with 'all the requirements.' And the decisions made and in structions issued by the officers charged with its administration show that they uniformly have taken the position that a claim cannot be initiated by asserted acts of settlement which are only colorable and done with a purpose to hold the land for speculation or while maintaining an actual residence elsewhere.4 The instructions say:
9
10
'Settlement is initiated through the personal act of a settler placing improvements on the land or establishing a residence thereon. * * * When settlement is made on unsurveyed lands the settler must plainly mark the boundaries of all land claimed. Within a reasonable time after settlement actual residence must be established on the land and continuously maintained.'
10
11
The decisions of this court have established the principle that one who, in response to the invitation in the homestead law, actually settles on the public lands in an honest effort to acquire a home should be dealt with leniently and not subjected to the loss of his toil and efforts through any mistake or neglect of the officers or agents of the Government. Ard v. Brandon, L. Ed. 524; Northern Pacific R. R. Co. v. Amacker, L. Ed. 274; Tarpey v. Madsen, L. Ed. 1042; Nelson v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., L. Ed. 406; Oregon & California R. R. Co. v. United States (No. L. Ed. St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Ry. Co. v. Donohue, L. Ed. 941. But its decisions also show that this salutary rule does not excuse substantial failures to comply with the requirements respecting the initiation of such a claim or accord to it a preference over other claims lawfully acquired and prior in time. Maddox v. Burnham, L. Ed. 527; Northern Pacific R. R. Co. v. Amacker, supra; Weyerhaeuser v. Hoyt, et seq., Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Wass, Svor v. Morris, L. Ed. 623; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Houston. 
11
12
The Supreme Court of the state rightly recognized that the plaintiff's claim was initiated long after the company's selection at the local land office, and therefore that the real question was whether Tincker's asserted acts prior to that selection amounted to the initiation of a homestead claim. If they did the tract in dispute was not subject to selection under the act of otherwise it was. The important words of the act are, public lands 'to which no adverse right or claim shall have attached or have been initiated at the time of the making of such selection.' The Supreme Court of the state held that Tincker's acts 'were not sufficient to initiate a bona fide settlement,' but concluded with some hesitation that they nevertheless took the tract out of the class of lands subject to selection.
12
13
We agree that Tincker did not make a bona fide settlement, and we are further of opinion that his acts fell so far short of such a settlement that they did not amount to the initiation of a claim in any admissible view of the homestead law or the act of He did nothing indicative of a present purpose to establish a home on the quarter section. He started no real improvements, made no preparations for living there, did not attempt to reside there and did not take his family there, but confined himself to minor acts calculated merely to deter others from initiating claims. In the seven or eight months preceding the company's selection he was on the land but twice-less than a day each time. His subsequent conduct, if we turn to it, is equally persuasive that he was without a present purpose to make the place a home. He merely visited it once or twice a year, usually on hunting trips, and on those visits only renewed the notices intended to deter others. Considering what he did and his testimony that he was expecting from his first trip in 1901 to his sale in 1906 that 'some day' he would go there to live, we think it apparent that his asserted settlement, even if not a myth in his own mind, fell pronouncedly short of satisfying the requirements of the homestead law in respect of the initiation of a claim, and so did not except the quarter-quarter in question from the company's right of selection under the act of He endeavored in his testimony to attribute his omissions to a temporary withdrawal of the land and the surrounding area pending an inquiry as to whether they should be included in an existing forest reserve. But that withdrawal-it later was revoked-could not have been a factor in the matter, because the withdrawal order when produced in evidence disclosed that it was made more than a year after his asserted settlement and more than six months after the company's selection, and that it contained a provision declaring that bona fide settlements and valid claims were not affected by it.
13
14
If, while maintaining a home at Maple Falls, Tincker could initiate a homestead claim by acts such as are disclosed here, and thus hold the land against others desiring to initiate claims, the way was open for him similarly to make a colorable appropriation of many tracts in that timber region, and thus to exact tribute from intending settlers and claimants. His acts, if effective against the company's right of selection, would be equally an obstacle to the initiation of homestead settlement claims, which is admissible only in respect of unappropriated public lands.
14
15
The state court regarded its conclusion as deriving some support from cases in this court; but we think the cases cited are not susceptible of that interpretation. All are cases where the individual claim which operated to defeat the railroad claim or selection was prior in time and had been initiated either by an entry at the land office or by an actual bona fide settlement. Kansas Pacific Railway Co. v. Dunmeyer, L. Ed. 1122, and St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Ry. Co. v. Donohue, L. Ed. 941, are typical of all. In both a homestead claim prior in time was involved. In the first it had been initiated by an entry at the land office, and in the second by actual settlement and occupancy in good faith. In both it was in existence when the right of the railroad company oecame fixed, if fixed at all, and the ruling was that such a claim existing at that time excepted the land-from the company's grant in one case and from its right of lieu selection in the other-and that a subsequent abandonment, relinquishment, or failure to comply with the law on the part of the homestead claimant neither obviated the exception nor entitled the company to the land-under the grant in one case and the selection in the other. We perceive nothing in either case which makes for the view that acts which fall far short of initiating a claim, in either mode, work such an exception.
15

The selection in St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Ry. Co. v. Donohue was under the act of now before us, and was of unsurveyed land. When it was made, a qualified claimant, who had settled theretofore and given notice of the extent of his claim, was residing on, occupying, and improving the land and in good faith conforming to the homestead requirements. Subsequently he died, and his mother as sole heir sold his possessory claim and improvements to Donohue, who made a timber and stone entry of the land after the survey. This court, after carefully pointing out that the homestead claim was lawfully initiated, held that the land was excepted from the right of selection, and therefore that the selection was of no avail. Most of the discussion in the opinion was to no purpose if, as is contended here, it was immaterial whether the homestead claim was initiated in substantial conformity to the homestead requirements.

17
A selection of unsurveyed land under the same act was involved in Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Hower, and was sustained against an asserted prior homestead claim on the ground that, while the claimant had put a small barn on the tract and had cut a trail across it prior to the selection, he had never resided thereon, or shown any purpose to do so, but had been maintaining a home on other land, not even contiguous to it.

The Donohue Case and the Hower Case taken together, illustrate the principle of prior cases, and show how it should be applied here.

PEOPLE'S NATURAL GAS CO.
v.
PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF PENNSYLVANIA, et al. (two cases).
Argued Oct. 21 and 22, 1925.
1
These two cases are practically but one. The matter in controversy is the constitutional validity of an order of the Public Service Commission of Pennsylvania requiring the People's Natural Gas Company to continue its prior practice of supplying natural gas to another company at Johnstown for sale to consumers in that city. On successive appeals to the Superior Court and the Supreme Court of the state the People's Company challenged the order as directly regulating and burdening interstate commerce and depriving the company of property without due process of law in violation of constitutional restraints on state action; but both contentions were overruled and the order was sustained. 79 Pa. Super. Ct. On these writs of error the company relies only on the contention that the order is a forbidden interference with interstate commerce.
1
2
The People's Company is a public service corporation created under the laws of Pennsylvania, and engaged in producing, purchasing, transporting by pipe line, and selling natural gas. It purchases about two-thirds of the gas which it transports and sells from a producing company in West Virginia having pipe lines leading from wells in that state to the boundary between the two states, and it produces the other one-third from its own wells in the southwestern counties of Pennsylvania. It has a system of pipe lines in Pennsylvania, which is connected at the state boundary with the lines of the West Virginia company, and leads thence to Pittsburgh, Johnstown, and other Pennsylvania cities and boroughs, where it sells the gas. The gas coming from West Virginia is transported, through the pipe lines as connected at the state boundary, in a continuous stream from the places of production in one state to those of consumption in the other. At the state boundary that gas passes through a registering meter, and that point is treated as the place of delivery to the People's Company; but the transportation is not interrupted there. The gas from the company's wells in Pennsylvania is fed into the moving stream at different points after it crosses the state boundary. The movement of the stream towards the points of destination is accelerated by means of pumps in Pennsylvania-one near the state line and one remote from it.
2
3
The People's Company sells directly to consumers at the several places of consumption. other than Johnstown, and there it sells to an independent company, having a local franchise and distributing plant, which sells to consumers. For upwards of 10 years the gas sold to that company was supplied under a contract, but when the order in question was made the People's Company had exercised a reserved privilege of terminating the contract; and the commission, in making the order, proceeded on the theory that the People's Company is a public service corporation, and may be required, irrespective of the terms of the contract, to continue supplying gas to the local company, and thus to continue its indirect service to Johnstown consumers. The order does not fix the rate for this service, but contemplates that it shall be fixed primarily by a schedule to be filed by the People's Company and shall be subject to supervision by the commission as respects its reasonableness.
3
4
In the state courts the cases had many features which are immaterial here and need not be noticed.
4
5
The Supreme Court of the state, in overruling the contention that the order is a forbidden interference with interstate commerce, put its decision on two grounds: First, that no interstate commerce is involved; and, secondly, that if such commerce is involved the order is not a forbidden interference, but an admissible exertion of power, which exists in the state in the absence of regulation by Congress under its paramount power. The first ground of decision was based on two conclusions: One that, as the West Virginia gas is delivered at the state boundary and the title passes there, interstate commerce therein ends at that boundary and the further transportation and sale in Pannsylvania are in intrastate commerce; and the other that the gas produced in Pennsylvania and there fed into the pipe lines is more than sufficient to enable the company to comply with the order, and that when the order is construed in the light of this situation it does not require that any West Virginia gas be used in complying with it. Both conclusions are earnestly challenged by the People's Company-the former as de parting from the decisions of this court respecting the nature of transactions is natural gas transported from one state to another, and the other as without an adequate basis in the evidence and treating the Pennsylvania gas, after it is unavoidably commingled with that from West Virginia, as being separable and having a distinct status.
5
6
As respects the West Virginia gas, we are of opinion, in view of its continuous transportation from the places of production in one state to those of consumption in the other, and its prompt delivery to purchasers when it reaches the intended destinations, that it must be held to be in interstate commerce throughout these transactions. Prior decisions leave no room for discussion on this point and show that the passing of custody and title at the state boundary without arresting the movement to the destinations intended are minor details which do not affect the essential nature of the business. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Foster, L. Ed. Public Utilities Commission v. Landon, L. Ed. 577; Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, L. Ed. 434; United Fuel Gas Co. v. Hallanan, L. Ed. 234; Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, A. L. R. 300; Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, Missouri v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., Ohio Railroad Commission v. Worthington, Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Co., L. Ed. 458; Shafer v. Farmers' Grain Co.. 
6
7
As respects the Pennsylvania gas we think it must be held to be in intrastate commerce only. Feeding it into the same pipe lines with the West Virginia gas works no change in this regard. Of course, after the commingling, the two are undistinguishable But the proportions of both in the mixture are known, and that of either readily may be withdrawn without affecting the transportation or sale of the rest. So for all practical purposes the two are separable, and neither affects the character of the business as to the other. Eureka Pipe Line Co. v. Hallanan, United Fuel Gas Co. v. Hallanan, L. Ed. 234. And see Hallanan v. Eureka Pipe Line Co., Hallanan v. United Fuel Gas Co., The Supreme Court of the state has found that more than enough Pennsylvania gas goes into the mixture to meet the requirements of the order, and on this basis has construed the order as leaving the company free to deal in usual course with so much of the mixture as represents the gas from West Virginia. We think the finding has ample support in the evidence, and we accept, of course, that court's construction of the order. In these circumstances the conclusion is unavoidable, we think, that the order does not interfere with or affect the interstate commerce in which the company is engaged.
7
8
Whether the order, if it did apply to gas in such commerce, could be sustained, becomes immaterial, in view of the conclusion just stated, and therefore need not be considered.

9
Judgments affirmed.

CHILDERS, State Auditor of Oklahoma,
v.
BEAVER et al.
Argued March 9, 1926.
1
See-sah Quapaw, a full-blood Quapaw Indian woman, died March 4, 1920. She owned certain duly allotted lands in Oklahoma, patented by the Secretary of the Interior September 26, 1896, and declared to be 'inalienable for a period of 25 years' thereafter-all as provided by the Act of March Following the state statute of descent, the Secretary declared that the only heirs were her husband and brother-John Beaver and Benjamin Quapaw-full-blood Quapaws. Act June (Comp. St. § ; Henrietta First Moon v. Starling White Tail, (March . Restrictions upon the land were continued for another 25 years by the Act of March .
1
2
Apparently appellant supposed that the lands passed to the heirs by virtue of the laws of the state and were subject to the inheritance taxes which she laid. He accordingly demanded their payment of appellees and threatened enforcement by summary process and sale of the lands. The court below held that the state had no right to demand the taxes and restrained appellant from attempting to collect them.
2
3
The duty of the Secretary of the Interior to determine the heirs according to the state law of descent is not questioned. Congress provided that the lands should descend and directed how the heirs should be ascertained. It adopted the provisions of the Oklahoma statute as an expression of its own will; the laws of Missouri or Kansas, or any other state, might have been accepted. The lands really passed under a law of the United States, and not by Oklahoma's permission.
3
4
It must be accepted as established that during the trust or restrictive period Congress has power to control lands within a state which have been duly allotted to Indians by the United States and thereafter conveyed through trust or restrictive patents. This is essential to the proper discharge of their duty to a dependent people, and the means or instrumentalities utilized therein cannot be subjected to taxation by the state without assent of the federal government.

270 U.S. 568
TUTUN
v.
UNITED STATES. NEUBERGER v. SAME.
Argued March 3, 1926.
1
These cases present, by certificate, the question whether the Circuit Courts of Appeals have jurisdiction to review a decree or order of a federal District Court denying the petition of an alien to be admitted to citizenship in the United States.
1
2
The existence of the jurisdiction was assumed by this court, without discussion, in Ozawa v. United States, L. Ed. 199. It has been exercised by the Circuit Courts of Appeals in most of the circuits.1 In the Fifth circuit jurisdiction was denied in United States v. Dolla, Ann. Cas. Although the correctness of the decision was questioned by Judge Amidon in United States v. Leonore (D. C.) and by Judge Hough in United States v. Mulvey (C. C. A.) it has been followed in the Third circuit and in the Eighth.2 In the state courts judgments granting or denying petitions for naturalization have generally been held to be reviewable on appeal, like other cases.3
2
3
The 'jurisdiction to naturalize aliens as citizens of the United States' is conferred by Act of June (Comp. St. § upon the District Courts, among others. Jurisdiction to review the 'final decision in the District Courts * * * in all cases,' except as otherwise provided, was conferred by Act of March upon Circuit Courts of Appeals. This provisions was re-enacted in Judicial Code, § and by Act of February in section 128(a) (Comp. St. Supp. The order granting or denying a petition for naturalization is clearly a final decision within the meaning of that section. Ex parte Tiffany, L. Ed. 443. This is true, although a certificate granted may be canceled under section 15 of the Naturalization Act (Comp. St. s . United States v. Ness, And a denial of the petition may not preclude another application for naturalization. In re Pollock (D. C.) Compare Salinger v. Loisel, L. Ed. 989. The substantial question is whether a petition for naturalization is a case within the meaning of the Circuit Court of Appeals Act.
3
4
The function of admitting to citizenship has been conferred exclusively upon courts continuously since the foundation of our government. See Act of March The federal District Courts, among others, have performed that function since the Act of January The constitutionality of this exercise of jurisdiction has never been questioned. If the proceeding were not a case or controversy within the meaning of article 3, § 2, this delegation of power upon the courts would have been invalid. Hayburn's Case, United States v. Ferreira, Muskrat v. United States, Whether a proceeding which results in a grant is a judicial one does not depend upon the nature of the thing granted, but upon the nature of the proceeding which Congress has provided for securing the grant. The United States may create rights in individuals against itself and provide only an administrative remedy. United States v. Babcock, L. Ed. 1011. It may provide a legal remedy, but make resort to the courts available only after all administrative remedies have been exhausted. Compare New Orleans v. Paine, United States v. Sing Tuck, American Steel Foundries v. Robertson, It may give to the individual the option of either an administrative or a legal remedy. Compare Clyde v. United States, L. Ed. 479; Chorpenning v. United States, Or it may provide only a remedy. Compare Turner v. United States, Whenever the law provides a remedy enforceable in the courts according to the regular course of legal procedure, and that remedy is pursued, there arises a case within the meaning of the Constitution, whether the subject of the litigation be property or status. A petition for naturalization is clearly a proceeding of that character.
4
5
The petitioner's claim is one arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. The claim is presented to the court in such a form that the judicial power is capable of acting upon it. The proceeding is instituted and is conducted throughout according to the regular course of judicial procedure. The United States is always a possible adverse party. By section 11 of the Naturalization Act (Comp. St. § the full rights of a litigant are expressly reserved to it. See In re Mudarri (C. C.) Its contentions are submitted to the court for adjudication. See Smith v. Adams, L. Ed. 895. Section provides that every final hearing must be held in open court, that upon such hearing the applicant and witnesses shall be examined under oath before the court and in its presence, and that every final order must be made under the hand of the court and shall be entered in full upon the record. The judgment entered, like other judgments of a court of record, is accepted as complete evidence of its own validity unless set aside. Campbell v. Gordon, L. Ed. 190; Spratt v. Spratt, It may not be collaterally attacked. Pintsch Compressing Co. v. Bergin (C. C.) If a certificate is procured when the prescribed qualifications have no existence in fact, it may be canceled by suit. 'It is in this respect,' as stated in Johannessen v. United States, 'closely analogous to a public grant of land (Rev. Stat. § et seq. (Comp. St. § ), or of the exclusive right to make, use and vend a new and useful invention (Rev. Stat. § et. seq. (Comp. St. § ).'
5
6
The opportunity to become a citizen of the United States is said to be merely a privilege, and not a right. It is true that the Constitution does not confer upon aliens the right to naturalization. But it authorizes Congress to establish a uniform rule therefor. Article 1, § 8, cl. 4. The opportunity having been conferred by the Naturalization Act, there is a statutory right in the alien to submit his petition and evidence to a court, to have that tribunal pass upon them, and, if the requisite facts are established, to receive the certificate. See United States v. Shanahan (D. C.) There is, of course, no 'right to naturalization unless all statutory requirements are complied with.' United States v. Ginsberg, L. Ed. 853); Luria v. United States, The applicant for citizenship, like other suitors who institute proceedings in a court of justice to secure the determination of an asserted right, must allege in his petition the fulfillment of all conditions upon the existence of which the alleged right is made dependent, and he must establish these allegations by competent evidence to the satisfaction of the court. In re Bodek (C. C.) Hill (N. Y.) In passing upon the application the court exercises judicial judgment. It does not confer or withhold a favor.
6
7
The government contends that, at all events, a naturalization proceeding is not a case within the meaning of the Circuit Court of Appeals Act. The same phrase may, of course, have different meanings when used in different connections. Lamar v. United States, L. Ed. 526. The Constitution does not require that a litigant be afforded the opportunity of having every judicial decision reviewed by an appellate court. Compare Rogers v. Peck, But the Circuit Court of Appeals Act conferred upon that court appellate jurisdiction of final decisions of the district courts 'in all cases' except those for which it provided a direct review by this Court. See Lau Ow Bew v. United States, L. Ed. 340; The Paquete Habana, L. Ed. 320. A denial of a review in naturalization cases would ingraft an exception upon an otherwise universal rule. Compare Craig v. Hecht, L. Ed. 293; In re Graves (C. C. A.) There is nothing in that act which should limit the application of the all-embracing language used.
7
8
It is argued that the Naturalization Act denies appellate jurisdiction, since section 3 declares that 'exclusive jurisdiction to naturalize aliens as citizens' is conferred upon the federal and state courts there specified, and these do not include the Circuit Courts of Appeals. The term 'exclusive' was used in section 3 in order to withdraw the jurisdiction which minor state courts, being courts of record, had exercised under the authority conferred by earlier naturalization statutes. See House Doc. No. t Sess. Ser. No. The section makes no reference to appellate proceedings. It is also argued that Congress manifested the intention of denying the usual method of appellate review by providing in section 15 for a bill in equity to cancel certificates of citizenship. The remedy afforded to the government by section 15 is narrower in scope than the review commonly afforded by appellate courts. Moreover, there is no corresponding provision which would afford to the applicant for citizenship an independent remedy for correcting errors committed in the district court.
8
9
Since the adoption of the Constitution Congress has by its legislation sought to promote the naturalization of qualified resident aliens. The act of did not introduce any change in policy. It did change, in some respects, the qualifications; and to carry out the established policy through more effective application of the law, it made changes in administrative and judicial machinery. That end is subserved by the correction of errors of the trial court through appellate review. Neither United States v. Ness, L. Ed. 321, nor the history of the legislation there referred to, leads to a denial of appellate review. In that case attention was called to the fact that Congress had not provided in the act of for an appeal from judgments of the state courts admitting aliens to citizenship. The question under discussion was whether a judgment of naturalization entered by a state court barred as res judicata a proceeding brought in a federal court under section 15 to cancel the certificate of naturalization.
9
10
To the questions asked in the two cases, we answer that the Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to review by appeal the order or decree of the District Court denying the petition to be admitted to citizenship in the United States.

SMITH et al.
v.
ILLINOIS BELL TELEPHONE CO. (two cases.)
Argued March 5, 1926.
1
The telephone company, an illinois corporation, owns and operates a telephone system in the city of Peoria and vicinity. It brought suit on June 18, 1924, against appellants (members of the state Commerce Commission and Attorney General of the state of Illinois), to enjoin them from enforcing or attempting to enforce a schedule of rates alleged to be confiscatory, and from taking any steps or proceedings against the company by reason of the collection by it of rates and charges under another and higher schedule. A motion to dismiss the bill was overruled, and, upon the bill and attached exhibits and affidavits, appellants refusing to plead further, a permanent injunction in accordance with the prayer was granted by the lower court. The appeal in No. is from that decree.
1
2
The appeal in No. is from an order previously entered, granting an interlocutory injunction. A motion to dismiss that appeal, on the ground that the order for the interlocutory injunction had become merged in the final decree, was submitted, but consideration postponed to the hearing on the merits. The motion is now granted and the appeal in No. dismissed. Shaffer v. Carter, L. Ed. 445; Pacific Tel. Co. v. Kuykendall, L. Ed. 975. In the cases cited, both interlocutory and permanent injunctions had been denied; here they were granted; but the record discloses no reason which prevents the same principle from being applicable.
2
3
The averments of the bill, which, upon this record, must be taken as true, disclose the following facts:
3
4
The operations of the company wee conducted with reasonable economy. For the year the net revenues, after payment of operating expenses and taxes, were, in round figures, $ for the year there was a deficit of over $ a deficit of nearly $ and a deficit for each month of the year preceding the filing of the bill. The fair value of the property, including working capital, material and supplies, and going value, was at least $.
4
5
In July, 1919, the predecessor in ownership of the company filed with the commission a schedule of rates covering the telephone service in question, which the commission, by final order after a hearing, approved. Prior to that order, however, the predecessor of the company had filed with the commission a second schedule of increased rates, to become effective May 1, 1920. The commission first suspended the effective date of this schedule until August 29, 1920, and then, by successive orders. until February 26, 1921, August 26, 1921, and February 23, 1922. The present company, in December, 1920, succeeded to the property and rights of its predecessor.
5
 hearings were had before the commission in respect of the justice and reasonableness of the rates proposed by the second schedule, but no determination of the matter was reached. The commission, although often requested by the company to do so, thereafter failed and refused to hold further hearings, but on October 31, 1921, entered an order purporting permanently to suspend, cancel, and annul the second schedule. A hearing was applied for and denied.
6
7
Thereupon an appeal was prosecuted to the circuit of Peoria county, and that court, on April 6, 1922, reversed the commission's order and remanded the cause for further proceedings. The commission redocketed the cause and had hearings in June, July, and September, 1922, after which the company filed its written motion requesting the commission to make effective a temporary schedule of rates pending a final determination. This motion was denied on September 28, 1922. On July 5, 1923, the company called attention to the delay in the determination of the cause, and to the fact that the revenues derived from the operation of the Peoria exchange fell short of meeting its operating expenses, and requested the commission to set the cause for an early hearing. This request was ignored, and the commission ever since has failed and refused to determine the issues in the cause, or to determine whether the rates and charges provided in the second schedule are just and reasonable, but has continued in effect the rates and charges contained in the first schedule approved by it. These rates, not only do not yield a fair return, but are insufficient to pay the operating cost of rendering telephone service to the subscribers and patrons of the exchange. Finally, it is alleged that the company is deprived of its property without due process of law, and is denied the equal protection of the law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution.
7
8
This conclusion, which necessarily results from the facts, is not seriously challenged, but a reversal of the decree below is sought on the ground that the company, prior to filing its bill, had not exhausted its legislative remedies. The argument seems to be that the second proposed schedule of rates, filed while the first was pending, purported to cancel the first schedule; that the order putting into force the rates in the first schedule was in effect a finding against the second, and put an end to it; that no legal application for an increase of rates has since been made; therefore, when the suit was brought nothing was before the commission upon which that body could lawfully act. The short answer is that the commission, after disposing of the first schedule, had uniformly treated the second as pending; had held hearings and made interlocutory orders in respect of it; had entered an order for its permanent suspension; after reversal by the state court on appeal, by which tribunal it was regarded as properly pending, had restored it to the docket for further proceedings; and had held further hearings. To say now that all this shall go for naught, and that the company must institute another and distinct proceeding, would be to put aside substance for needless ceremony.
8
9
It thus appears that, following the decree of the state court reversing the permanent order in respect of the second schedule and directing further proceedings, the commission for a period of two years remained practically dormant, and nothing in the circumstances suggests that it had any intention of going further with the matter. For this apparent neglect on the part of the commission, no reason or excuse has been given; and it is just to say that, without explanation, its conduct evinces an entire lack of that acute appreciation of justice which should characterize a tribunal charged with the delicate and important duty of regulating the rates of a public utility with fairness to its patrons, but with a hand quick to preserve it from confiscation. Property may be as effectively taken by long-continued and unreasonable delay in putting an end to confiscatory rates as by an express affirmance of them; and where, in that respect, such a state of facts is disclosed as we have here, the injured public service company is not required indefinitely to await a decision of the rate-making tribunal before applying to a federal court for equitable relief. The facts, which the motion to dismiss conceded, present a far stronger case for such relief than any of the cases with which this court dealt in Okla. Gas Co. v. Russell, L. Ed. 659, Prendergast v. N. Y. Tel. Co., L. Ed. 853; Pacific Tel. Co. v. Kuykendall, supra, and Banton v. Belt Line Ry., L. Ed. 1020.
9
10
Some complaint is made to the effect that the decree attempts to bind persons not parties to the suit, including thousands of subscribers, and to prohibit appellants from enforcing in the future any legislative remedy for excessive charges, hereafter imposed, however unreasonable they may be. As to the first branch of the complaint, it is only necessary to say that the commission represents the public and especially the subscribers, and they are properly bound by the decree. In re Engelhard & Sons Co., L. Ed. 416. As to the other objection, there is nothing in the decree, rightly construed, which attempts to curtail or could curtail the legislative or rate-making powers of appellants to proceed hereafter under the state law, subject to such limitations, if any, as may be required by the doctrines of res judicata, ordinarily applicable in such cases.

v.
NEW YORK COTTON EXCHANGE et al.
Argued March 9, 1926.
1
The Odd-Lot Cotton Exchange is an organization whose members make contracts for themselves and for customers for the future delivery of cotton in lots of not more than nor less than 10 bales. The members of the New Cotton Exchange, which is organized under a special act of the New York Legislature (chapter , also make contracts for the purchase and sale of cotton for further delivery, either for themselves or for customers; such contracts being made only upon open viva voce bidding, between certain hours of the day and in the rooms of the exchange in New York City. Quotations of prices thus established are collected by the New York exchange, and, under the terms of a written agreement with that exchange, the Western Union company pays $annually for the privilege of receiving and distributing them throughout the United States, to such persons as the exchange approves. Applicants for such quotations must sign an application and agree not to use them in connection with a bucket shop or to give them out to other persons. The Gold & Stock Telegraph Company, a New York corporation and a subsidiary of, and controlled by, the Western Union, is engaged in disseminating quotations of cotton prices by means of ticker service, owned and operated by it, tickers being located in exchanges, brokerage houses, and elsewhere in the several states. The Odd-Lot Exchange made application to the two telegraph companies for this service in the form required by the contract with the New York exchange. It was refused; the New York exchange having declined to give its consent to the installation on the ground, among others, that, after investigation, it had ascertained that the Odd-Lot had succeeded another exchange, which had been convicted of conducting a bucket shop, and that the Odd-Lot had in its membership many members of the convicted exchange, and was organized as a cover to enable its members to engage in the same unlawful business.

2
Federal jurisdiction is invoked under the anti-trust laws of the United States. The bill avers that the contracts between members of the Odd-Lot are chiefly for producers of cotton and others located, resident and in business in other states than New York, and are made and effectuated by communications through the Western Union by wire; that such contracts concern and include deliveries of cotton from cotton-growing states to and into the state of New York, involving actual interstate shipment and transportation; that the New York exchange has a monopoly upon the receipt and dissemination of cotton price quotations, through which quotations and prices of cotton, both spot and for future delivery, are influenced, guided, and fixed in the exchanges and markets throughout the United States; that the contract with the Western Union is in restraint of interstate trade and commerce in cotton, and was entered into for the purpose of monopolizing and restraining that commerce. There is an attempt to allege unfair methods of competition, which may be put aside at once, since relief in such cases under the Trade Commission Act (Comp. St. §§ ) must be afforded in the first instance by the commission.
2
3
The prayer is for a decree canceling the Western Union contract, adjudging the New York Cotton Exchange to be a monopoly, restraining appellees from refusing to install a ticker and furnish the Odd-Lot and its members, as they do others, with continuous cotton quotations, and for other relief.
3
4
The answer, in addition to denials and affirmative defensive matter, sets up a counterclaim to the effect that the Odd-Lot, though it had been refused permission to use the quotations of the New York exchange, was purloining them, or receiving them from some person who was purloining them, and giving them out to its members, who were distributing them to bucket ships, with the consequent impairment of the value of appellees' property therein. An injunction against the continuance of this practice was asked.
4
5
Both parties moved for interlocutory injunctions. The district court denied appellant's motion and granted that of appellees. Upon appeal, both orders were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. By stipulation of the parties authorizing such action, the Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the cause, with directions to the District Court to enter a final decree dismissing the bill and making permanent the injunction granted appellees. Since this left to the District Court only the ministerial duty of complying with the mandate, the decree below, for purposes of appeal, is final. Gulf Refining Co. v. United States. 
5
6
First. We are of opinion that upon the allegations of the bill no case is made under the federal anti-trust laws. The only possible ground on which the suit can be maintained rests in the claim that there is a violation of sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, c. (Comp. St. §§ , for which appellant is entitled to sue under section 16 of the Clayton Act, c. (Comp. St. § ). And whether this claim is tenable turns alone upon the effect of the contract between the New York exchange and the Western Union. Independent of that contract, there is no averment of fact in the bill upon which a violation of the Anti-Trust Act can be predicated. The New York exchange is engaged in a local business. Transactions between its members are purely local in their inception and in their execution. They consist of agreements made on the spot for the purchase and sale of cotton for future delivery, with a provision that such cotton must be represented by a warehouse receipt issued by a licensed ware-house in the Port of New York and be deliverable from such warehouse. Such agreements do not provide for, nor does it appear that they contemplate, the shipment of cotton from one state to another. If interstate shipments are actually made, it is not because of any contractual obligation to that effect; but it is a chance happening which cannot have the effect of converting these purely local agreements or the transactions to which they relate into subjects of interstate commerce. Ware & Leland Co. v. Mobile County, Ann. Cas. The most that can be said is that the agreements are likely to give rise to interstate shipments. This is not enough. Engel v. O'Malley, L. Ed. 128. See also Hopkins v. United States, L. Ed. 290; Anderson v. United States, L. Ed. 300.
6
7
It is equally clear that the contract with the Western Union for the distribution of the quotations to such persons as the New York exchange shall approve does not fall within the reach of the Anti-Trust Act. Under that contract, the exchange at its own expense collects the quotations and delivers them to the telegraph company for distribution to such approved persons. The real distributor is the exchange; the telegraph company is an agency through which the distribution is made. In effect, the exchange hands over the quotations, as it might any other message, to the telegraph company for transmission, charges to be collected from the receivers. The payment which the telegraph company makes to the exchange is for the privilege of having the business. It does not alter the character of the service rendered.
7
8
In furnishing the quotations to one and refusing to furnish them to another, the exchange is but exercising the ordinary right of a private vendor of news or other property. As a common carrier of messages for hire, the telegraph company, of course, is bound to carry for alike. But it cannot be required-indeed, it is not permitted-to deliver messages to others than those designated by the sender. We fully agree with what is said upon similar facts by Judge Ingraham in Matter of Renville, App. Div. :
8
9
'I cannot see that it makes any difference whether a dispatch is given to a telegraph company to be communicated to a single individual, or to be communicated to ten, a hundred or a thousand individuals. Under this agreement between the stock exchange and the respondents, certain information is given to the telegraph company to be communicated to individuals or corporations designated by the Stock Exchange. Whether we call this information a special dispatch or general information which the Stock Exchange desires to communicate, seems to me to be entirely immaterial. The fact that the telegraph company pays to the stock exchange a certain sum of money for the information which it receives to transmit is also immaterial. The substance is that those to whom this information is directed to be given by the stock exchange are willing to pay the Stock Exchange for such information, and are also willing to pay the telegraph company the expense of transmitting the information. The information delivered to the respondents for transmission is a communication which the Stock Exchange wishes to transmit to the persons it designates and to no one else. I can see no reason why the Stock Exchange should be required to furnish the appellant with this information, which relates solely to its own business upon its own property, or why the respondents should be required to violate their agreement with the Stock Exchange and the law of this state, and furnish to the appellant information which had been communicated to the respondents by the Stock Exchange for a specific purpose and none other.'
9
10
So far as the exchange is concerned, the evident purpose of the contract was to further and protect its business. The terms are entirely appropriate and legitimate to that end. The effect of the making and execution of the contract upon interstate trade or commerce, if any, is indirect and incidental. Neither in purpose nor effect does it directly or unreasonably restrain such commerce or operate to create a monopoly. It has long been settled by this court that under such circumstances a trader or manufacturer engaged in a purely private business may freely exercise his independent discretion in respect of the persons with whom he will deal and to whom he will sell and refuse to sell. Cases to this effect are cited in the opinion of the court below. It is unnecessary to repeat, or add to, those citations here. It is enough to refer to the decision of this court in Board of Trade v. Christie Grain & Stock Co., where, in all essential particulars, the question now under review was presented and determined. There a suit was brought by the Board of Trade to enjoin the defendants from getting and distributing price quotations on sales of grain and provisions for future delivery. They were obtained in some way not disclosed, but not from either of the telegraph companies authorized by contract to distribute them, as the Western Union was authorized here. This court held that the collection of quotations belonged to the board and was entitled to protection; that the board did not lose its rights by communicating the information to others in confidential relations to it and under contract not to make it public; and that defendants should be enjoined. Holding the contracts with the telegraph companies not to be in conflict with the Anti-Trust Act, it was said (page ):
10
11
'But so far as these contracts limit the communication of what the plaintiff might have refrained from communicating to any one, there is no monopoly or attempt at monopoly, and no contract in restraint of trade, either under the statute or at common law. Bement v. National Harrow Co. (; Fowle v. Park (L. Ed. 67); Elliman v. Carrington ( It is argued that the true purpose is to exclude all persons who do not deal through members of the Board of Trade. Whether there is anything in the law to hinder these regulations being made with that intent we shall not consider, as we do not regard such a general scheme as shown by the contracts or proved. A scheme to exclude bucket shops is shown and proclaimed, no doubt-and the defendants, with their contention as to the plaintiff, call this an attempt at a monopoly in bucket shops. But it is simply a restraint on the acquisition for illegal purposes of the fruits of the plaintiff's work. Central Stock & Grain Exchange v. Board of Trade ( We are of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to an injunction as prayed.'
11
12
Second. The decree granting an injunction upon the counterclaim is challenged on the grounds, shortly stated: (1) That the court, having dismissed the bill for lack of jurisdictional facts, should have dismissed the counter claim also, there being no independent basis of jurisdiction; (2) that the counterclaim does not arise out of any transaction which is the subject-matter of the suit; and (3) that the decree is not justified by the allegations of the counterclaim or the proof.
12
 We do not understand that the dismissal was for the reason that there was an absence of jurisdiction to entertain the bill. What the court held was that the facts alleged were insufficient to establish a case under the Anti-Trust Act. Whether the objection that a bill of complaint does not state a case within the terms of a federal statute challenges the jurisdiction or goes only to the merits, is not always easy to determine. The question has been recently reviewed at some length by this court in Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, and the distinction pointed out as follows:
13
14
'Jurisdiction is the power to decide a justiciable controversy, and includes questions of law as well as of fact. A complaint setting forth a substantial claim under a federal statute presents a case within the jurisdiction of the court as a federal court; and this jurisdiction cannot be made to stand or fall upon the way the court may chance to decide an issue as to the legal sufficiency of the facts alleged any more than upon the way it may decide as to the legal sufficiency of the facts proven. Its decision either way upon either question is predicated upon the existence of jurisdiction, not upon the absence of it. Jurisdiction, as distinguished from merits, is wanting only where the claim set forth in the complaint is so unsubstantial as to be frivolous or, in other words, is plainly without color of merit (citing cases). In that event the claim of federal right under the statute, is a mere pretense and, in effect, is no claim at all.'
14
15
Here facts are set forth in a serious attempt to justify the claim that the federal statute has been violated, and, while we hold them to be insufficient to sustain the claim, we are not prepared to say that they are so obviously insufficient as to cause it to be without color of merit and in effect no claim at all. We think there is enough in the bill to call for the exercise of the jurisdiction of a federal court to decide, upon the merits, the issue of the issue of the legal sufficiency of the allegations to make out the claim of federal right. This was evidently the view of the court below, and we construe it mandate as a direction to dismiss the bill on the merits and not for want of jurisdiction.
15
16
'The answer must state in short and simple form any counterclaim arising out of the transaction which is the subject-matter of the suit, and may, without cross-bill, set up any set-off or counterclaim against the plaintiff which might be the subject of an independent suit in equity against him, and such set-off or counterclaim, so set up, shall have the same effect as a cross-suit, so as to enable the court to pronounce a final decree in the same suit on both the original and the cross-claims.'
16
17
Two classes of counterclaims thus are provided for: (a) One 'arising out of the transaction which is the subject-matter of the suit,' which must be pleaded; and (b) another 'which might be the subject of an independent suit in equity' and which may be brought forward at the option of the defendant. We are of opinion that this counterclaim comes within the first branch of the rule, and we need not consider the point that, under the second branch, federal jurisdiction independent of the original bill must appear, as was held in Cleveland Engineering Co. v. Galion D. M. Truck Co. (D. C.) .
17
18
The bill sets forth the contract with the Western Union and the refusal of the New York exchange to allow appellant to receive the continuous cotton quotations, and asks a mandatory injunction to compel appellees to furnish them. The answer admits the refusal and justifies it. The counterclaim sets up that, nevertheless, appellant is purloining or otherwise illegally obtaining them, and asks that this practice be enjoined. 'Transaction' is a word of flexible meaning. It may comprehend a series of many occurrences, depending not so much upon the immediateness of their connection as upon their logical relationship. The refusal to furnish the quotations is one of the links in the chain which constitutes the transaction upon which appellant here bases its cause of action. It is an important part of the transaction constituting the subject-matter of the counterclaim. It is the one circumstance without which neither party would have found it necessary to seek relief. Essential facts alleged by appellant enter into and constitute in part the cause of action set forth in the counterclaim. That they are not precisely identical, or that the counterclaim embraces additional allegations, as, for example, that appellant is unlawfully getting the quotations, does not matter. To hold otherwise would be to rob this branch of the rule of all serviceable meaning, since the facts relied upon by the plaintiff rarely, if ever, are, in all particulars, the same as those constituting the defendant's counterclaim. Compare the Xenia Branch Bank v. Lee, 7 Abb. Prac. (N. Y.) And see, generally, Cleveland Engineering Co. v. Galion D. M. Truck Co., supra, page Champion Spark Plug Co. v. Champion Ignition Co. (D. C.) .
18
19
So close is the connection between the case sought to be stated in the bill and that set up in the counterclaim, that it only needs the failure of the former to establish a foundation for the latter; but the relief afforded by the dismissal of the bill is not complete without an injunction restraining appellant from continuing to obtain by stealthy appropriation what the court had held it could not have by judicial compulsion.
19
 Finally, the point is made that the court of appeals erred in directing the District Court to enter a final decree making permanent the interlocutory injunction granted on the counterclaim because not warranted by the allegations or proof. Evidently for the purpose of facilitating an appeal to this court, appellant, by stipulation, consented that the affidavits filed in support of the preliminary application should be treated as testimony in support of the counterclaim and, on this, that the court of appeals might direct the entry of a final decree. The district court thought the pleadings and affidavits sufficient to warrant a preliminary injunction and the court of appeals thought them sufficient to sustain a decree making that injunction permanent. We see no reason to differ with their conclusions.

Decree affirmed.

270 U.S. 611
CHICAGO, R. I. & P. RY. CO.
v.
SCHENDEL. SAME v. ELDER.
Argued March 17, 18, 1926.
1
These cases grow out of an accident on the line of the railway company in Iowa, in which Hope was killed and Elder was injured, under circumstances establishing the negligence of the railway company and its consequent liability for damages. The defense in each case was that the controlling issue had become res judicata. In the Hope Case, petitioner pleaded a final judgment, entered, under the Iowa Workmen's Compensation Law, by an Iowa state court of record possessing general jurisdiction, and, in the Elder Case, a decision made by a deputy industrial commissioner appointed under the same law. In both cases, the full faith and credit clause of the federal Constitution was invoked. At the trial in the Minnesota district court, the judgment in the one case and the decision in the other, together with a copy of the Iowa Workmen's Compensation Law, all properly authenticated, were offered in evidence in support of the plea, but, upon objection, excluded. Verdicts against the railway company were rendered and judgments entered accordingly. Appeals to the state supreme court followed. The action of the Minnesota district court in refusing to give effect to the Iowa judgment and decision was assigned as error and duly challenged as denying them the full faith and credit enjoined by the federal Constitution; but the Minnesota Supreme Court, upon full consideration, sustained the trial court in that respect and affirmed both judgments. 
1
2
The Iowa Workmen's Compensation Law is elective in form. Hope and Elder were residents of Iowa and employees of the railway company, and it is not in dispute that they and the company had elected to be bound by its provisions. The statute will be found in Code of Iowa et seq. It adopts a schedule of compensation, creates the office of industrial commissioner, and authorizes him to appoint a deputy, make rules and regulations not inconsistent with the act, summon witnesses, administer oaths, etc., and contains other provisions, not necessary to be stated, for its administration and enforcement. If the parties fail to reach an agreement in regard to the compensation, the commissioner, at the request of either party, is directed to form a committee of arbitration to consist of three persons, one of whom shall be the commissioner, the others to be named by the parties, respectively. The arbitrators are directed to hear the case and decide the matter. Their decision, together with a statement of the evidence, findings of fact, rulings of law, and other pertinent matters, must then be filed with the commissioner. At the end of five days after such filing, unless a review is sought in the meantime, the decision becomes enforceable. Upon the application of any party in interest, the commissioner may review the decision; and, if any party be aggrieved by reason of his order or decree thereon, such party may appeal to the state district court having jurisdiction, in the manner and upon the grounds set forth in the act. The judgment of that court is given the same effect as though rendered in a suit duly heard and determined therein; and an appeal from it lies to the Supreme Court of the state.

In the Hope Case, the action was brought in the Minnesota district court on February 21, 1923, under the federal Employers' Liability Law (Comp. St. §§ , for the sole benefit of the surviving widow. Thereafter, on March 2, 1923, the railway company instituted a proceeding before the Iowa industrial commissioner under the Iowa Workmen's Compensation Act. To this proceeding the decedent's widow was made a party, as the sole beneficiary under the act. The railway company asked for an arbitration. The widow answered, asserting that the Compensation Act did not apply because the company and the deceased were both engaged in interstate commerce at the time of the accident. Arbitrators were appointed, though the widow did not join in their appointment. The arbitrators found that deceased was engaged in intrastate commerce and that the case was governed by the Compensation Act, and awarded compensation to the widow. Thereupon, the widow filed an application in review with the commissioner That officer reviewed the facts, specifically found that the deceased was engaged in intrastate commerce, and approved the award. The widow then appealed to the district court of Lucas county, Iowa, and that court, on June 2, 1923, specifically held that the deceased was engaged in intrastate commerce and entered final judgment affirming the award. Thereafter, on March 4, 1924, the present action was heard in the Minnesota district court and verdict and judgment rendered for respondent.
4
5
The Minnesota Supreme Court held that the plea of res judicata was bad for two reasons: (1) That 'the substantive right given the employee or his representative by Comgress under express constitutional grant, with the courts to which he may go for its enforcement pointed out to him, is a superior substantive right; and that when he or his representative has chosen the forum to which to submit his cause, he cannot, against his objection and upon the initiative of his employer, be required to submit it in a summary proceeding commenced later under a Compensation Act'; and (2) that there was a lack of identity of parties, since under the Iowa statute the right of recovery is in the beneficiary while under the federal act the right is in the personal representative.
5
6
1. It is evident from the opinion, that the court formulated the first reason with some hesitation. It is elementary, of course, that, in any judicial proceeding, the arrangement of the parties on the record, so long as they are adverse, or the fact that the party against whom the estoppel is pleaded was an objecting party, is of no consequence. A judgment is as binding upon an unwilling defendant as it is upon a willing plaintiff. Nor is it material that the action or proceeding, in which the judgment, set up as an estoppel, is rendered, was brought after the commencement of the action or proceeding in which it is pleaded. Where both are in personam, the second action or proceeding 'does not tend to impair or defeat the jurisdiction of the court in which a prior action for the same cause is pending. Each court is free to proceed in its own way and in its own time, without reference to the proceedings in the other court. Whenever a judgment is rendered in one of the courts and pleaded in the other, the effect of that judgment is to be determined by the application of the principles of res judicata by the court in which the action is still pending in the orderly exercise of its jurisdiction, as it would determine any other question of fact or law arising in the progress of the case. The rule, therefore, has become generally established that where the action first brought is in personam and seeks only a personal judgment, another action for the same cause in another jurisdiction is not precluded.' Kline v. Burke Constr. Co., A. L. R. 1077.
6
7
It is urged in behalf of respondent that the federal act is supreme and supersedes all state laws in respect of employers' liability in interstate commerce. That is quite true; but it does not advance the solution of the point in dispute, since it is equally true that, in respect of such liability arising in intrastate commerce, the state law is supreme. Judicial power to determine the question in a case brought under a state statute is in no way inferior or subordinate to the same power in a case brought under the federal act.
7
8
The Iowa proceeding was brought and determined upon the theory that Hope was engaged in intrastate commerce; the Minnesota action was brought and determined upon the opposite theory that he was engaged in interstate commerce. The point at issue was the same. That the Iowa court had jurisdiction to entertain the proceeding and decide the question under the state statute, cannot be doubted. Under the federal act, the Minnesota court had equal authority; but the Iowa judgment was first rendered. And, upon familiar principles, irrespective of which action or proceeding was first brought, it is the first final judgment rendered in one of the courts which becomes conclusive in the other as res judicata. Boatmen's Bank v. Fritzlen, Merritt v. American Steel Barge Co., Williams v. Southern Pac. Co., Cal. App. And see Insurance Co. v. Harris, where the rule as stated was recognized.
8
9
The Iowa court, under the Compensation Law, in the due exercise of its jurisdiction, having adjudicated the character of the commerce in which the deceased was engaged, that matter, whether rightly decided or not, must be taken as conclusively established, so long as the judgment remains unmodified. United States v. Moser, and cases cited. And, putting aside for the moment the question in respect of identity of parties, the judgment upon the point was none the less conclusive as res judicata because it was rendered under the state Compensation Law, while the action in which it was pleaded arose under the federal Liability Law. Dennison v. Payne (C. C. A.) Williams v. Southern Pac. Co., supra, pages .
9
 In the Iowa proceeding, the widow of the deceased was a party in her own right and clearly was bound by the judgment. The action in Minnesota, however, was brought by the administrator, and the state Supreme Court on the authority of Dennison v. Payne, supra, pages held that there was a want of identity of parties. The decision in the Dennison Case rests entirely on Troxell v. Del., Lack. & West. R. R., The effect of the last-named case we pass for later consideration.
10
11
Hope's death as the result of the negligence of the railroad company gave rise to a single cause of action, to be enforced directly by the widow, under the state law, or in the name of the personal representative, for the sole benefit of the widow, under the federal law, depending upon the character of the commerce in which the deceased and the company were engaged at the time of the accident. In either case, the controlling question is precisely the same, namely, Was the deceased engaged in intrastate or interstate commerce? and the right to be enforced is precisely the same, namely, the right of the widow, as sole beneficiary, to be compensated in damages for her loss. The fact that the party impleaded, under the state law, was the widow, and, under the federal law, was the personal representative, does not settle the question of identity of parties. That must be determined as a matter of substance and not of mere form. The essential consideration is that it is the right of the widow, and of no one else, which was presented and adjudicated in both courts. If a judgment in the Minnesota action in favor of the administrator had been first rendered, it does not admit of doubt that it would have been conclusive against the right of the widow to recover under the Iowa compensation law. And it follows, as a necessary corollary, that the Iowa judgment, being first, is equally conclusive against the administrator in the Minnesota action; for if, in legal contemplation, there is identity of parties in the one situation, there must be like identity in the other.
11
12
The first proposition finds support in Heckman v. United States, L. Ed. 820) where this court held that the United States had capacity to maintain a suit to set aside conveyances made by Indian allottees of allotted lands and that the allottees need not be joined. The defendant in that case insisted that, unless the allottees who had executed the conveyances were brought in as parties, he was in danger of being subjected to a second suit by the allottees. Answering that contention, this court said:
12
13
'But if the United States, representing the owners of restricted lands, is entitled to bring a suit of this character, it must follow that the decree will bind not only the United States, but the Indians whom it represents in the litigation. This consequence is involved in the representation Kerrison v. Stewart; Shaw v. Railroad Co.; Beals v. Ill., etc., R. R. Co. (L. Ed. 608). And it could not, consistently with any principle, be tolerated that, after the United States on behalf of its wards had invoked the jurisdiction of its courts to cancel conveyances in violation of the restrictions prescribed by Congress, these wards should themselves be permitted to relitigate the question.'
13
14
And, conversely, in United States v. Des Moines Valley R. Co., where a suit in the name of the government was brought to enforce the right of a private party, it was held that a prior adverse adjudication by a state court in a suit against him personally, determining the same issues, was available as an estoppel against the government. The ground of the decision was thus stated (pages ):
14
15
'Inasmuch, then, as the government sues for the sole benefit of Fairchild, and for the professed purpose of reinvesting him with a title which he has lost, we are of opinion that, whether the present action be regarded as brought under the Act of March (Comp. St. § 4895 et seq.)), or as brought in pursuance of its general right to sue, the government should be held estopped by the previous adjudications against the real party in interest in the state court. The subject-matter and the issue to be tried being the same in this proceeding as in the former actions, the losing party on the former trials ought not to be permitted to renew the controversy in the name of a merely nominal plaintiff, and thereby avoid the effect of the former adjudications. Southern Minnesota Railway Extension Co. v. St. Paul & S. C. R. Co., This doctrine was applied by this court in the case of Union Pac. Ry. Co. v. U. S., C. C. A. 123, which was a suit brought by the United States under the Act of March 3, 1887, wherein we held that the United States was bound by an estoppel which might have been invoked against the real party in interest if the suit had been brought in his name, because it appeared that the United States had no substantial interest in the controversy, and was merely a nominal plaintiff.'
15
16
Since the statutory authority of the administrator is to sue, not in his own right or for his own benefit, or that of the estate, but in the right and for the sole benefit of the widow, the same principles are applicable, in accordance with the general rule that 'whenever an action may properly be maintained or defended by a trustee in his representative capacity without joining the beneficiary, the latter is necessarily bound by the judgment.' 1 Freeman on Judgments ( Identity of parties is not a mere matter of form, but of substance. Parties nominally the same may be, in legal effect, different (Bigelow on Estoppel (; and parties nominally different may be, in legal effect, the same (Calhoun's Lessee v. Dunning, L. Ed. 767; Follansbee v. Walker, In re Estate of Parks. 
16
17
In the Follansbee Case, a judgment against Joshua Follansbee alone was held available as an estoppel in another action brought by Walker & Follansbee for the use of Joshua. Justice Sharswood, speaking for the court, said:
17
18
'The parties in that suit and in the action tried below were substantially the same. In the former Joshua Follansbee was the legal, in the latter he is the equitable, plaintiff. The subject-matter of the two suits appeared by the record to be identical. The presumption would be upon the issues, that the merits had been passed upon in the former proceeding. Such being the case, if no technical objection appeared to have been raised upon the record to the right of Joshua Follansbee to maintain the action as legal plaintiff, the judgment in that action would be a bar to a subsequent action by him as equitable plaintiff. If it appeared that only the equitable, not the legal right, was in Joshua Follansbee, it would be presumed that the defendant had waived that purely technical objection. It would be very unreasonable and contrary to the settled rules upon the subject, to permit the plaintiff having once been defeated on the merits, to try the same question over again in a different form.'
18
19
In the Parks Case, a judgment against the sole beneficiary of an estate in her individual capacity was held conclusive in a subsequent action by the same plaintiff against the same defendant as administratrix, on the ground that, while theoretically the former suit was not against the same defendant as administratrix, nevertheless she was the sole beneficiary of the estate, and represented only herself in each case.
19
20
In Corcoran v. Chesapeake, etc., Canal Co., this court, holding that a judgment against a trustee for bondholders was conclusive in a suit involving the same subject-matter, brought by him in his individual character, said:
20
21
'It would be a new and very dangerous doctrine in the equity practice to hold that the cestui que trust is not bound by the decree against his trustee in the very matter of the trust for which he was appointed.'
21
22
See, also, Kerrison, Assignee, v. Stewart et al., Spokane & Inland R. R. v. Whitley, L. Ed. Estate of Bell, Chandler v. Lumber, Co.. 
22
23
Upon facts almost identical with those now under review, it was held in Williams v. Southern Pac. Co., supra, pages , that there was a substantial identity of parties, and that a judgment for the widow under the California Compensation Act was available as an estoppel in a prior action brought by her as administratrix under the federal act.
23
24
It remains only to consider the bearing of the Troxell Case, supra, upon this point. Mrs. Troxell, the widow of a deceased employee, sued the railroad company under a state statute, for the benefit of herself and minor children, to recover for the death of her husband resulting from a negligent failure to provide safe instrumentalities. There was a judgment against her. She then brought suit under the federal Employers' Liability Act, as administratrix, averring the negligence of a fellow servant, a ground of recovery which was not available to her in the action under the state statute. It was held, following the general rule, that, the cause of action in the two cases being different and the issue determined in the first not being involved in the second, there was no estoppel. This was decisive of the case, but the court proceeded to say that, furthermore, there was not an identity of parties in the two actions. Two former decisions of this court are cited, Brown v. Flectcher's Estate, L. Ed. 966 and Ingersoll v. Coram, L. Ed. 208. Both cases, following the well-established rule, simply decide that there is no privity between administrators appointed in different states, since the authority of an executor or administrator appointed in one state does not extend to the property or administration in another state.
24
25
Whether, in the light of the foregoing views, we now should hold that where, as in the Troxell Case, the rights of additional beneficiaries, not actual parties to the first judgment, are involved, the requirement of identity of parties is unsatisfied, is a question we do not feel called upon here to re-examine, since we are clear that such requirement is fully met in the situation now under consideration, where the sole beneficiary was an actual party to the proceeding under the state law, and present by her statutory representative in the action under the federal law, and no other rights were involved.

In the Elder Case, as in the case just considered, the railway company began a proceeding before the industrial commissioner. Elder answered, averring that he was engaged in interstate commerce at the time of the injury. The parties stipulated that the commissioner or his deputy should take the place of the arbitration committee; and the deputy commissioner, pursuant to the stipulation, heard the matter and filed his decision. Thereupon Elder applied for a review by the commissioner, under the statute, but no action had been taken upon that application by the commissioner at the time the judgment was rendered in the Minnesota court. Under the Iowa statute, therefore, the decision had not ripened into an enforceable award, and we are not called upon to determine what, in that event, would have been its effect as an estoppel. The proceeding being still in fieri when the Minnesota case was tried and determined, the doctrine of res judicata is not applicable. There must be a final judgment. Bigelow on Estoppel (6th Ed.) p. 64; Webb v. Buckelew et al..

It follows that the judgment in the Hope Case must be reversed, and that in the Elder Case affirmed.

KEITH
v.
JOHNSON.
Argued Jan. 6, 1926.
 John B. Johnson, a resident of New York, died intestate. Respondent was appointed administratrix and in that year paid to the state $ the transfer tax imposed pursuant to article 10, Tax Law (chapter 60, Consolidated Laws). When respondent made the income tax return for the estate for (Revenue Act (Comp. St. § et seq.)), she claimed that the state transfer tax paid in that year was deductible; but, yielding to the regulations of the Treasury Department, she did not make the deduction, and under protest paid to the United States an income tax calculated on $ amounting to $ If the deduction had been made there would have been no taxable income. This action was brought to recover the amount paid. The District Court gave respondent judgment which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.

Under the Revenue Act of the income of the estate for during administration was subject to a tax to be assessed against the administratrix. She was required to pay the tax and was indemnified against claims of beneficiaries for the amount paid. Section 2(b). It is provided that in computing net income, in the case of a citizen or resident of the United States, for the purpose of the tax there shall be allowed as deductions the taxes imposed by the authority of the United States or of any state and paid within the year. Section 5(a) Third. Administrators and other fiduciaries are subject to all the provisions which apply to individuals. Section 8(c).

3
In United States v. Woodward, it was held that the federal estate taxes imposed by the Revenue Act of are deductible in ascertaining net taxable income received by estates of deceased persons during the period of administration or settlement. Revenue Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. a et seq.). The court said (:
3
4
'It (the estate tax) is made a charge on the estate and is to be paid out of it by the administrator or executor substantially as other taxes and charges are paid. * * * It does not segregate any part of the estate from the rest and keep it from passing to the administrator or executor for purposes of administration, * * * but is made a general charge on the gross estate and is to be paid in money out of any available funds or, if there be none, by converting other property into money for the purpose.'
4
5
The government contends that the state transfer tax is not imposed on the estate and is not deductible in calculating the federal tax on the income of the estate.
5
6
The transfer tax law imposes a tax 'upon the transfer of property' from the deceased (section at rates graduated, according to the amount transferred to each beneficiary and the relationship, or absence of any, between the deceased and beneficiaries. Sections a). Until paid the tax is a lien upon the property of the deceased. The person to whom the property is transferred is made personally liable for the tax. The personal representatives of the deceased are personally liable for the tax until its payment; they are authorized to sell the property of the estate to obtain money to pay the tax in the same manner as they may to pay debts of the deceased. Section They are not entitled to discharge until the tax is paid. Section The law plainly makes it their duty to pay the tax out of the estate. The property remaining passes to the beneficiaries. When property is transferred without the deduction of the tax the beneficiary is required to pay. But, by whomsoever the amount may be handed over to the state, the tax is in effect an appropriation by the state of a part of the property of the deceased at the time of death, and the state's portion is deductible from the legacy and does not pass to the legatee. If money is transferred the tax is withheld; property other than money passes subject to the transfer tax. Cf. Matter of Estate of Swift, L. R. A. 709. In Matter of Marriam, a bequest to the United States was held subject to the tax. The court said (:
6
7
'This tax, in effect, limits the power of testamentary disposition, and legatees and devisees take their bequests and devises subject to this tax imposed upon the succession of property. This view eliminates from the case the point urged by the appellant that to collect this tax would be in violation of the well-established rule that the state cannot tax the property of the United States. Assuming this legacy vested in the United States at the moment of testator's death, yet in contemplation of law the tax was fixed on the succession at the same instant of time. This is not a tax imposed by the state on the property of the United States. The property that vests in the United States under this will is the net amount of its legacy after the succession tax is paid.'
7
8
That case was brought to this court on writ of error. United States v. Perkins, L. Ed. 287. Following the decisions of the New York court it was held that the transfer tax is not imposed on property but on the transfer, and that the property does not pass to the heirs or legatees until, by the enforced contribution to the state, it has suffered diminution to the amount of the tax. And see Prentiss v. Eisner (D. C.) affirmed (C. C. A.) People v. Fraser, affirming .
8
9
The government cites New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, A. L. R. 660. In that case there was involved the amount of the federal estate tax under section of the Revenue Act of (Comp. St. § (Comp. St. § d) provided that there should be deducted from the value of the gross estate funeral expenses, administration expenses, claims against the estate, certain losses, 'and such other charges against the estate as are allowed by the laws of the jurisdiction' where the estate was administered. When that case was before this court the latest decision of the New York Court of Appeals, having a direct bearing upon the matter, was Matter of Gihon, It was there held that the state transfer tax was the same as the federal inheritance tax imposed by the War Revenue Act of June which was considered by this court in Knowlton v. Moore, L. Ed. 969; that the tax was not primarily payable out the estate; that it was a tax not upon property but upon succession, 'that is to say, a tax on the legatee for the privilege of succeeding to property,' and that payment of the tax by the personal representative was for the legatee and not on account of the estate. In harmony with that case this court held that the state transfer tax paid by the executors was not deductible in calculating the amount of the federal estate tax. Since then the courts of New York, notwithstanding the Gihon Case, have construed the statute in harmony with the earlier decisions of the New York courts and United States v. Perkins, supra.
9
10
In Home Trust Co. v. Law, App. Div. the court considered the state law which imposes an income tax on individuals (Tax Law, § as added by Laws N. Y. , and makes that tax applicable to income of estates of deceased persons received during administration. Section as added by Laws N. Y. It is shown that the state income tax and deductions (section as added by Laws N. Y. from gross earnings, authorized to be made to determine the amount of the taxable income of the estate, are patterned after the corresponding federal taxes and deductions; and, following the decision of this court in United States v. Woodward, supra, it was held that, since the federal estate tax paid is deductible to arrive at the income of the estate subject to the federal tax, the state transfer tax should be held to be deductible in ascertaining the income of the estate taxable under the state law. The court said (App. Div. :
10
11
'Aside from authority and theory we think it was the clear legislative intent, as indicated by the various provisions of the Tax Law, that in calculating the net income of the estate of a decedent for income tax purposes, the amount paid by an executor during the year in satisfaction of a transfer tax should be deducted. The income tax payment is made by the executor of the estate from funds of the estate and not from funds belonging to legatees. Kings County Trust Co. v. Law (App. Div. The transfer tax payment is made by the executor from the funds of the estate. 'The transfer tax is imposed upon the estate of the decedent as it exists at the hour of his death, and its value is to be fixed as of that time.' Matter of Hubbard ( Thus the tax is measurable not by the funds received by a legatee, but by the funds the executor receives. As the burden of paying the income tax, as well as the burden of paying the transfer tax is cast upon the executor, and as the taxable income of the estate is under the terms of the Tax Law measurable by gross income received less taxes paid, it would seem clear that the person paying the income tax, namely, the executor, is entitled to deduct the very transfer tax which he himself pays.'
11
12
This decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals without opinion. 
12
13
This court will follow the decisions of the state courts as to the meaning and proper application of the state transfer tax law, any expressions in its earlier decision to the contrary notwithstanding. Green v. Lessee of Neal, L. Ed. Fairfield v. County of Gallatin, Edward Hines Trustees v. Martin, L. Ed. 1050.
13
14
By indicating that the latest decisions of the state courts will be followed here as binding, it is not intended to intimate that a different view is entertained as to the construction properly to be given the state law. In fact we agree with that construction; and feel justified in so saying as the same question arises in another case-No. the opinion in which is announced concurrently with this one-on a substantially similar statute of a state where there has been no authoritative construction by the state courts. Compare Harrigan v. Bergdoll, No. L. Ed. decided this day. And we are of opinion that the transfer tax is deductible. It was primarily payable by the respondent out of moneys and other property of the estate; and it was so paid by her. While this lessens the amount for distribution among the heirs, it cannot be said that they bore any part of that tax. As well might it be claimed that they paid the funeral expenses and debts, if any, of the intestate. No part of the transfer tax so paid could be taken by the heirs as a deduction in claculating their federal income taxes. It follows that the amount of the tranfer tax paid in 1917 by the respondent was deductible in ascertaining the taxable income of the estate received by her in that year.
14
15
Judgment affirmed.

Lien of Tax and Collection by Executors, Administrators and Trustees. Every such tax shall be and remain a lien upon the property transferred until paid and the person to whom the property is so transferred, and the executors, administrators and trustees of every estate so transferred shall be personally liable for such tax until its payment. Every executor, administrator or trustee shall have full power to sell so much of the property of the decedent as will enable him to pay such tax in the same manner as he might be entitled by law to do for the payment of the debts of the testator or intestate. Any such executor, administrator or trustee having in charge or in trust any legacy or property for distribution subject to such tax shall deduct the tax therefrom and shall pay over the same to the state comptroller or county treasurer, as herein provided. If such legacy or property be not in money, he shall collect the tax thereon upon the appraised value thereof from the person entitled thereto. He shall not deliver or be compelled to deliver any specific legacy or property subject to tax under this article to any person until he shall have collected the tax thereon. If any such legacy shall be charged upon or payable out of real property, the heir or devisee shall deduct such tax therefrom and pay it to the executor, administrator or trustee, and the tax shall remain a lien or charge on such real property until paid; and the payment thereof shall be enforced by the executor, administrator or trustee in
the same manner that payment of the legacy might be enforced, or by the district attorney under section two hundred and thirty-five of this chapter. If any such legacy shall be given in money to any such person for a limited period, the executor, administrator or trustee shall retain the tax upon the whole amount, but if it be not in money, he shall make application to the court having jurisdiction of an accounting by him, to make an apportionment, if the case require it, of the sum to be paid into his hands by such legatees, and for such further order relative thereto as the case may require.

UNITED STATES
v.
MITCHELL et al.
Argued March 18, 19, 1926.
1
November Dellora R. Gates, a resident of Texas, died testate, and January 6, the county court of Jefferson county granted letters testamentary to appellees. The federal estate tax accrued one year after her death, and, November 26, the executors made a return showing $due the United States under the Revenue Act of They did not pay any part of the tax in but paid $February and the balance May 27, of that year. Under the Revenue Act of the executors, March 14, 1920, made an income tax return for the estate for showing a balance due of $ If the estate tax had been deducted, there would have been no taxable income for that year. In the executors paid an inheritance tax of $ which was imposed and became due in that year under the laws of Texas.3 If that amount had been deducted, the income tax of the estate for that year would have been reduced by $ When the return was made, the rulings and regulations of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the Secretary of the Treasury did not permit the deduction of the federal estate tax or the state inheritance tax, and for that reason the executors did not claim that either should be deducted, and paid the amount shown by the return. After the decision of this court in United States v. Woodward ( the executors filed a claim for refund which was denied. The Bureau of Internal Revenue offered to allow them to deduct the estate tax paid in 1920 from gross income, in calculating the income tax on the estate, for that year. The executors refused to do so and brought this action in which they seek to recover the full amount of the income tax paid. And, in the event that the estate tax shall be held not deductible, they seek to recover $ the amount by which the income tax would have been lessened if the Texas inheritance tax paid in that year had been deducted. The Court of Claims held the estate tax deductible, and gave judgment for the full amount.
1
2
It is established that, in calculating the income tax on an estate during administration under Revenue Act , federal estate taxes are deductible. United States v. Woodward, supra. But the question presented by this case is whether in calculating the income tax for the executors were entitled to deduct from the gross income actually received in that year the estate tax which was not paid until The executors maintain that under section estate taxes are deductible if paid or if accrued within the taxable year, and that the estate tax, accruing in 1919 and paid in 1920, was deductible from gross income actually received in 1919. When regard is had to other provisions of the act, it is clear that this contention is not admissible. Section (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. § a) declares that 'paid' means 'paid or accrued,' and that the phrase 'paid or accrued' shall be construed according to the method of accounting upon the basis on which the net income is computed under section (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. § f). And section provides that net income shall be computed on the basis of the taxpayer's annual accounting period in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the books of the taxpayer (United States v. Anderson, but if no such method has been employed, or if the method employed does not reflect the income, the computation shall be made upon a basis and in a manner that, in the opinion of the Commissioner, does clearly reflect the income. The return shows that it was made on the basis of income actually received in 1919. This indicates that the accounts were kept on the basis of actual receipts and disbursements, and there is nothing in the record to show that any other method was employed. The burden is on the executors to establish the invalidity of the tax. United States v. Anderson, supra. They have not shown that their books were kept on the accrual basis. Assuming, as we must, that the accounts of the estate were kept on the basis of actual receipts and disbursements, the executors were required to make return on that basis. Notwithstanding the option given taxpayers, it is the purpose of the Act to require returns that clearly reflect taxable income. That purpose will not be accomplished unless income received and deductible disbursements made are treated consistently. It was not the purpose of the Act to permit gross income actually received to be diminished by taxes or other deductible items disbursed in a later year, even if accrued in the taxable year. It is a reasonable construction of the law that the same method be applied to both sides of the account.
2
3
Appellees contend that United States v. Woodward, supra, governs this case. The provisions of the Revenue Act of and of the Revenue Act of which are here involved were considered in that case. The cases are much alike. Woodward died December 15, 1917, and the estate tax became due one year later, but it was not paid until February 8, 1919. It may be assumed that the return for included only the income actually received in that year. The rules and regulations then in force did not permit the deduction of the estate tax. If that deduction had been made there would have been no taxable income. The executors paid the tax under duress, and brought suit for the amount paid. The Court of Claims held them entitled to recover, and this court affirmed the judgment. The question considered and decided was whether in ascertaining net taxable income the estate tax was deductible. The opinion referred to the provision which imposes the tax upon incomes of estates and that part of section which authorizes the deduction of 'taxes paid or accrued within the taxable year imposed (a) by the authority of the United States, except income, war profits and excess profits taxes,' and, in discussing the clause defining the deductions permitted to be made, the court said (page ):
3
4
'The words of its major clause are comprehensive and include every tax which is charged against the estate by the authority of the United States. The excepting clause specifially enumerates what is to be excepted. The implication from the latter is that the taxes which it enumerates would be within the major clause were they not expressly excepted, and also that there was no purpose to except any others. Estate taxes were as well known at the time the provision was framed as the ones particularly excepted. * * * Thus their omission from the excepting clause means that Congress did not intend to except them. The act of calls the estate tax a 'tax' and particularly denominates it an 'estate tax.' This court recently has recognized that it is a duty or excise and is imposed in the exertion of the taxing power of the United States. New York Trust Co. v. Eisner (A. L. R. 660).'
4
5
The question decided concerned the character of the exaction; that is, whether the so-called federal 'estate taxes' were 'taxes' within the meaning of that word as used in the clause of section quoted. The government did not contend that, if deductible at all, the estate taxes could not be deducted in that case because the return was made on the basis of income actually received in 1918, whereas the estate tax, accruing in that year, was not paid until That question was not presented to the court for decision, and no such question was considered or decided. It is not to be thought that a question not raised by counsel or discussed in the opinion of the court has been decided merely because it existed in the record and might have been raised and considered. Webster v. Fall, L. Ed. 411. The Woodward Case does not support the contention that, where the estate income tax return is made on the basis of income actually received in the taxable year, there may be deducted the estate tax accruing in that year but paid in the following year.
5
6
It remains to be considered whether, in calculating the tax on the income of the estate, the inheritance tax imposed by the law of Texas and paid by appellees in 1919 is deductible from the gross income received in that year. That law provides that all property, which shall pass by will or by the laws of descent, shall upon passing to or for the use of any person (with certain exceptions) be subject to a tax for the benefit of the state. We are of opinion that, in respect of the matter under consideration, the Texas inheritance tax law cannot be distinguished from the New York transfer tax law; and that under Keith v. Johnson, decided this day, the executors are entitled to have the inheritance tax paid in 1919 deducted from the income of the estate received in that year.

MOTTRAM
v.
UNITED STATES.
Argued Jan. 15, 1926.
1
Plaintiff filed his petition claiming . damages because of failure of the United States to deliver him certain steam packing for which he bid at an auction sale of surplus war materials held at Slough, England. The Court of Claims made findings of fact and gave judgment for the United States dismissing the petition.
1
2
By an Act of Congress approved May (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. ), the President was authorized to sell property acquired in connection with the prosecution of the war. Pursuant to that act, an agreement was made by an army contracting officer, acting for the United States, with J. G. White & Co., Limited, of London, by which the latter agreed to sell at auction engineers' stores and equipment enumerated and described in an inventory compiled by such officer. The selling agents agreed to employ the auctioneer and other persons required to prepare and distribute catalogues and to conduct the sale. They employed an auctioneer to sell the stores and equipment at the United States Engineers' Depot at Slough, and advertised an auction sale to be held at that place on June 24, 1919, and days following. They issued a catalogue purporting to contain a list giving descriptions and quantities of the things to be sold. It showed that the United State was vendor, and specified that:
2
3
'The whole shall be sold, with all faults, imperfections, errors of description, in the lots of the catalogue * * * and without any warranty whatever, the buyers being held to have satisfied themselves as to the condition, quality, and description of the lots before bidding. * * *'
3
4
There were listed 22 lots of steam packing, and 11 of these were described as Garlock packing. Due to an error in transcribing a list furnished by the officer in command at the depot, the quantity of each lot of Garlock packing was expressed in hundredweights instead of pounds, and so indicated one hundred times the quantities intended. Plaintiff received notice of the sale through the press and from the catalogue which was furnished to him at his request by the auctioneer. He made many visits to the depot before the sale, and had full opportunity to ascertain the character and quantities of the property to be sold. At his request the Garlock packing was shown to him by one of the employees at the depot on the day before the sale. It was all housed together, and he had full opportunity to determine its quantity. He then had the catalogue which listed pounds for sale. It would have required cases to hold that amount and cubic feet of space to house it. Such a quantity would have supplied the needs of Great Britain for that article for 20 years. June 25, 1919, the plaintiff attended the sale as a bidder. And when the Garlock packing was offered, and after the question of the quantity of such packing had been raised and the auctioneer had stated that he would not guarantee any quantity, the plaintiff bid three and onefourth pence per pound for the lots of Garlock packing shown by the catalogue to amount in all to pounds, and these lots were knocked down to him at that price.
4
5
The auctioneer did not know that a mistake had been made in the catalogue, and sent plaintiff a bill which included the amount bid for the packing. June 30, 1919, plaintiff sent a check for the amount of the bill to the sales agents. The same day he gave to one Davies an option to buy from 50 to 90 tons of the packing. The option contained the following clause: 'Subject to the quantity being in stock as sold by the U. S. A.' When the sales agents received the check, they knew that there was no such quantity of steam packing at the depot. July 4, 1919, plaintiff was notified that a mistake had been made and that no such quantity had ever been at the depot. He then wrote the sales agents that he expected delivery of the quantity for which he had paid. They answered explaining the mistake, and stated that they considered the explanation sufficient to close the incident with the return of the money. Plaintiff replied that he would hold them to the contract, and afterwards he made demands for delivery of the quantity erroneously stated in the catalogue. Delivery was refused on the ground that the quantity demanded had never been in existence. Under an arrangement that it was done without prejudice to either party, there was returned to the plaintiff the amount paid by him according to his bid for the packing.
5
6
It was not the purpose of the United States to sell any property other than that belonging to it and then at its depot at Slough; and the facts found show that plaintiff so understood when he made his bid. The authority to sell conferred by Congress was limited to property acquired for the prosecution of the war. More than seven months had elapsed after the Armistice; a large part of the American Expeditionary Forces had been withdrawn from Europe, and the United States was disposing of its surplus war supplies there. Plaintiff was warned by the statement in the catalogue that the sales were to be held subject to errors of description and were to be made without any warranty He went to see the packing and had opportunity to determine quantities. It was obvious that the amount stated in the catalogue was erroneous and enormously in excess of that on hand. Plaintiff made his bid after the auctioneer had stated that he would not guarantee any quantity of Garlock packing. And the clause in the option to Davies shows that he was not relying on the statement of quantity in the catalogue.
6
7
It is clear that the facts are sufficient to show that when plaintiff made his bid he was charged with knowledge that the United States was not offering for sale any such quantity of Garlock packing as stated in the catalogue. He was not entitled to a greater amount than the United States had in the depot at Slough. There was no finding that delivery of that quantity was refused or that he was willing to accept it. He cannot recover. Lipshitz & Cohen v. United States, Brawley v. United States, Cf. Hummel, Trustee, v. United States.

EVANSVILLE & BOWLING GREEN PACKET CO.
v.
CHERO COLA BOTTLING Co. et al.
Argued Jan. 13, 1926.
1
Appellant owned a wharfboat in the Ohio river at Evansville, Ind. May 14, 1922, it sank, causing damage to appellee's merchandise thereon. Appellant filed a petition in admiralty for limitation of liability. Appellees answered, and after a trial, at which much evidence as to the character of the structure was given, the District Court found that it was not a vessel within the meaning of the statutes sought to be invoked, held that the court was without jurisdiction, and dismissed the cause. The appeal is under section Judicial Code (Comp. St. § , and the question of jurisdiction alone is certified.
1
Section 4283, Revised Statutes (Comp. St. § , provides:
2
3
'The liability of the owner of any vessel, for any embezzlement, loss, or destruction, by any person, of any property, goods, or merchandise, shipped or put on board of such vessel, or for any loss, damage, or injury by collision, or for any act, matter, or thing, lost (loss), damage, or forfeiture, done, occasioned, or incurred, without the privity, or knowledge of such owner or owners, shall in no case exceed the amount or value of the interest of such owner in such vessel, and her freight then pending.'
3
4
Section 3, Revised Statutes (Comp. St. § 3), provides:
4
5
'The word 'vessel' includes every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water.'
5
6
The Act of June (Comp. St. § , makes the provisions relating to limitation of liability apply to 'all vessels used on lakes or rivers or in inland navigation, including canal boats, barges, and lighters.'
6
7
Appellant was engaged in operating steamboats between Evansville and places on the Green river in Kentucky. The wharfboat in question was built in 1884 and was used at Hopefield, Ark., on the Mississippi river. In it was towed to Madison, Ind., where it was overhauled, and then to Louisville, Ky., where it was used. In after more repairs at Madison, it was taken to Evansville. Appellant acquired it in 1915. Each winter it was towed to Green river harbor to protect it from ice. While in use at Evansville it was secured to the shore by four or five cables, and remained at the same point, except when moved to conform to the stage of the river. The lower part of the structure was rectangular, feet long, 48 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. It was built of wood, and, to strengthen it and keep the water out, was lined around the sides and ends, extending 18 or 20 inches from the bottom, with concrete eight inches thick. It had no machinery or power for propulsion, and was not subject to government inspection, as are vessels operated on navigable waters. There was plumbing in the structure, and it was connected with the city water system; it obtained current for electric light from the city plant, and had telephone connections. Appellant's office and quarters for the men in charge were located in one end of the structure. There were floats and an apron making a driveway between the land and a door near each end. The wharfboat was used to transfer freight between steamboats and land and from one steamboat to another. Some shippers paid fixed monthly charges for storage of their goods on the structure and for services in transferring them to and from steamboats. Charges made for services performed by its use were for storage and handling, and not for transportation.
7
8
The rule of limited liability of owners of vessels is an ancient one. It has been administered in the courts of admiralty in Europe from time immemorial, and by statute applied in England for nearly two centuries. See Providence & New York S. S. Co. v. Hill Mfg. Co., L. Ed. 1038; The Main v. Williams, L. Ed. 381. Our statutes establishing the rule were enacted to promote the building of ships, to encourage the business of navigation, and in that respect to put this country on the same footing with other countries. See Moore v. American Transportation Co., Norwich Co. v. Wright, L. Ed. 585. The rule should be applied having regard to the purposes it is intended to subserve and the reasons on which it rests.
8

The only question presented is whether appellant's wharfboat was a 'vessel' at the time it sank. It was an aid to river traffic, but it was not used to carry freight from one place to another. It was not practically capable of being used as a means of transportation. It served at Evansville as an office, warehouse, and wharf, and was not taken from place to place. The connections with the water, electric light, and telephone systems of the city evidence a permanent location. It performed no function that might not have been performed as well by an appropriate structure on the land and by a floating stage or platform permanently attached to the land. It did not encounter perils of navigation to which craft used for transportation are exposed. There appears to be no reason for the application of the rule of limited liability. Many cases, involving a determination of what constitutes a vessel within the purview of the statute have been before the courts; but no decision has been cited, and we have found none, that supports the contention that this wharfboat was a vessel. Cf. Cope v. Valette Dry Dock Co., L. Ed. 501; The Robert W. Parsons, L. Ed. 73; Ruddiman v. A Scow Platform (D. C.) Patton-Tully Transportation Co. v. Turner (C. C. A.) .

271 U.S. 23
BOARD OF PUBLIC UTILITY COM'RS et al.
v.
NEW YORK TELEPHONE CO.
Argued Jan. 18, 19, 1926.
1
The is an appeal from a decree of the District Court-three judges sitting; section Judicial Code (Comp. St. § -which granted a temporary injunction restraining the enforcement of certain telephone rates.
1
2
The company owns and opinions a telephone system in New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut. In the territory served in New Jersey there are a number of local areas. Service between telephones in the same area is exchange service, and that between telephones in different areas is toll service. The latter includes both intrastate and interstate business. The system is used to give exchange and toll service to all subscribers. For about 10 years prior to the commencement of this suit the rates in New Jersey remained at substantially the same level. March 6, 1924, the company filed with the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, to take effect April 1, 1924, a schedule providing for an increase of rates for exchange service in New Jersey. The board suspended the proposed rates pending an investigation as to their reasonableness. December 31, 1924, the increase was disallowed, and the company was required to continue to serve at the existing rates. The board found that the value of the company's property in New Jersey, as of June that a rate of return of per cent., producing from $ would be a fair return for that year; that the amount charged by the company in 1924 for depreciation, $was excessive, and that $was sufficient. And the board found that net earnings in 1924 would be $ less than the fair return by at least $.
2
3
The company's accounts are kept according to the uniform system of accounts for telephone companies prescribed by the Inter-state Commerce Commission. Charges are made to cover the depreciation in the elements of the plant which for one cause or another will go out of use. These charges are made month by month against depreciation in the operating expense accounts and corresponding credits are entered in the depreciation reserve account. When a unit or element of the property is retired, there is no charge to operating expense, but its original cost, less salvage, is charged to the reserve account. December 31, 1923, the company's books showed a credit balance in depreciation reserve accounts of $ This was not set aside or kept in a separate fund, but was invested in the company's telephone plant. The board prescribed a rule for the determination of depreciation expenses to be charged by the company in 1925 and subsequent years. It declared that the credit balance was more than required for the maintenance of the property, and directed that $of that amount be used by the company to make up deficits in any year when earnings are less than a reasonable return as found by the board. And it said:
3
4
'But, having made such charges in the past, future charges, beginning January 1, 1925, may be deducted from the normal charge, until such time as at least $of the excess is absorbed as hereinafter provided.'
4
5
The effect of the order is to require that, if total operating expenses deducted from revenues leaves less than a reasonable return in 1925 or a subsequent year, there shall be deducted from the expense of depreciation in that year, and added to the net earnings, a sum sufficient to make up the deficiency; then, by appropriate book entries, the resulting shortage in depreciation expense is to be made good out of the balance in the reserve account built up in prior years.
5
6
On the application for a temporary injunction, the company attacked the findings of the board as to rate of return, property value, and expense of depreciation, and it contended that the charges on account of depreciation in earlier years were not excessive, and that in any event the company could not be compelled to make up deficits in future net earnings out of the depreciation reserves accumulated in the past.
6
7
The record shows that the rates in effect prior to the temporary injunction were not sufficient to produce revenue enough to pay necessary operating expenses and a just rate of return on the value of the property. There is printed in the margin1 a statement made by the board and included in its decision, giving a comparison of results of operation in 1924 under these rates as found by the board and as estimated by the company. And, in opposition to the motion for the temporary injunction, the board submitted an affidavit containing a statement2 which set forth in detail the estimated results for based on the same rates. The affidavit shows net additions to the company's property in New Jersey in 1924, amounting to more than $ and the board calculates the return on $as the reasonable value of the property. The calculation is made on three bases: (1) Depreciation taken at the company's figure, $ depreciation as found by the board, $ depreciation allowed by the board's order, $ The effect of the order is to deduct $from operating expenses found by the board properly chargeable for depreciation in 1925. This deduction is made at the expense of the property of the company paid for out of depreciation reserves built up in prior years, and it has the same effect on net earnings as would the addition of the same amount of revenue received for service. On the basis of the company's estimate of depreciation expense, the return is per cent.; on the board's estimate it is per cent.; and by increasing net earnings $ as directed by the order, it is made per cent. It is conceded that, unless, as directed by the board, depreciation expense is reduced below what the board itsel found necessary and net earnings are correspondingly increased, the rates cannot be sustained against attack on the ground that they are unreasonably low and confiscatory. Appellants do not contend that the rate of return from the intrastate business is or will be higher than that resulting from the company's business as a whole in New Jersey; and the record supports the claim of the company that the intrastate business or that covered by the exchange rates complained of is not relatively more profitable than the other business of the company.
7
8
It may be assumed, as found by the board, that in prior years the company charged excessive amounts to depreciation expense and so created in the reserve account balances greater than required adequately to maintain the property. It remains to be considered whether the company may be compelled to apply any part of the property or money represented by such balances to overcome deficits in present or future earnings and to sustain rates which otherwise could not be sustained.
8
9
The just compensation safeguarded to the utility by the Fourteenth Amendment is a reasonable return on the value of the property used at the time that it is being used for the public service, and rates not sufficient to yield that return are confiscatory. Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., L. Ed. Ann. Cas. Bluefield Co. v. Public Service Commission, L. Ed. 1176. Constitutional protection against confiscation does not depend on the source of the money used to purchase the property. It is enough that it is used to render the service. San Joaquin Co. v. Stanislaus County, L. Ed. 1041; Gaslight Co. v. Cedar Rapids, L. R. A. (N. S.) Am. St. Rep. affirmed Consolidated Gas Co. v. New York (C. C.) affirmed L. Ed. Ann.Cas. Ames v. Union Pacific Railway Co. (C. C.) The customers are entitled to demand service and the company must comply. The company is entitled to just compensation and, to have the service, the customers must pay for it. The relation between the company and its customers is not that of partners, agent and principal, or trustee and beneficiary. Cf. Fall River Gas Works v. Gas & Electric Light Com'rs, The revenue paid by the customers for service belongs to the company. The amount, if any, remaining after paying taxes and operating expenses including the expense of depreciation is the company's compensation for the use of its property. If there is no return, or if the amount is less than a reasonable return, the company must bear the loss. Past losses cannot be used to enhance the value of the property or to support a claim that rates for the future are confiscatory. Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, L. Ed. 678; Georgia Ry. v. R. R. Comm., L. Ed. 1144. And the law does not require the company to give up for the benefit of future subscribers any part of its accumulations from past operations. Profits of the past cannot be used to sustain confiscatory rates for the future. Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., L. Ed. 538; Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, supra; Monroe Gaslight & Fuel Co. v. Michigan Public Utilities Commission (D. C.) City of Minneapolis v. Rand (C. C. A.) Georgia Ry. & Power Co. v. Railroad Commission (D. C.) affirmed Chicago Rys. Co. v. Illinois Commerce Commission (D. C.) Garden City v. Telephone Co.. 
9
10
Customers pay for service, not for the property used to render it. Their payments are not contributions to depreciation or other operating expenses or to capital of the company. By paying bills for service they do not acquire any interest, legal or equitable, in the property used for their convenience or in the funds of the company. Property paid for out of moneys received for service belongs to the company just as does that purchased out of proceeds of its bonds and stock. It is conceded that the exchange rates complained of are not sufficient to yield a just return after paying taxes and operating expenses, including a proper allowance for current depreciation. The property or money of the company represented by the credit balance in the reserve for depreciation cannot be used to make up the deficiency.

STATE OF MISSOURI ex rel. HURWITZ
v.
NORTH et al., Board of Health of State of Missouri.
Submitted March 12, 1926.
1
Plaintiff in error was a physician licensed to practice by the state board of health of Missouri. On complaint made to the board, and after notice and hearing, his license to practice was revoked on the ground that he had unlawfully produced an abortion. The proceedings before the board were reviewed on certiorari by the state circuit court and the determination of the board sustained. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Missouri, the judgment was affirmed. The case comes here on writ of error. Judicial Code, § (Comp. St. Supp. 
1
2
By section of the Missouri Revised Statutes, the state board of health is authorized to grant licenses for the practice of medicine within the state, and, after hearing, to revoke licenses 'for producing criminal abortions,' and for other specified causes. Hearings are required to be upon 20 days' written notice, personally served upon the physician against whom charges are made, containing 'an exact statement of the charges and the date and place set for hearing.' The statute provides:
2
3
'Testimony may be taken by deposition, to be used in evidence on the trial of such charges before the board in the same manner and under the same rules and practice as is now provided for the taking of depositions in civil cases.'
3
4
It is also provided that proceedings before the board may be reviewed by the state circuit court on certiorari and, as was done here, an appeal may be taken from the judgment of the circuit court to the Supreme Court of the state.
4
5
Plaintiff's assignments of error assail the correctness of various rulings of the state court as to the meaning and effect of the statute drawn in question. These assignments must be disregarded here, as upon writ of error to a state court we are bound by its construction of the state law. See West v. Louisiana, Gatewood v. North Carolina, L. Ed. 305; Watson v. Maryland, Schneider Granite Co. v. Gast Realty Co., L. Ed. 292. The Supreme Court of Missouri held that, in the proceedings for the revocation of the plaintiff's license, he was entitled to take testimony on deposition, as provided by the statute, but not to subpoena witnesses to appear before the board, and that his application for such subpoenas was properly denied. It is assigned as error that these rulings and the revocation of plaintiff's license by the state board of health were a denial of due process of law and of the equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment.
5
6
It has been so often pointed out in the opinions of this court that the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned with the substance and not with the forms of procedure as to make unnecessary any extended discussion of the question here presented. The due process clause does not guarantee to a citizen of a state any particular form or method of state procedure. Its requirements are satisfied if he has reasonable notice, and reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present his claim or defense; due regard being had to the nature of the proceedings and the character of the rights which may be affected by it. Hurtado v. California, L. Ed. 232; Maxwell v. Dow, L. Ed. 597; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Schmidt, West v. Louisiana, supra; Twining v. New Jersey, Oregon R. R. & N. Co. v. Fairchild. 
6
7
The procedure authorized by the Missouri statute, as it was applied by the board, satisfied these requirements. The notice prescribed was reasonable. The testimony of all witnesses who appeared before the board was taken and recorded, including that of the plaintiff in error. Although the statute did not authorize the board to issue subpoenas, the plaintiff in error was authorized, as the state court held, to take the depositions of witnesses who did not voluntarily appear. See State ex rel. Farber v. Shot, Officers who take depositions are authorized to compel witnesses to attend and give testimony. Rev. Stat. Mo. The depositions, when taken, may be read at the hearing before the board. State ex rel. Farber v. Shot, supra. The procedure prescribed and followed here gave ample opportunity to plaintiff to make a defense to the charges preferred, and there was no denial of due process. Nor did the statute deny to the plaintiff in error the equal protection of the laws. A statute which places all physicians in a single class, and prescribes a uniform standard of professional attainment and conduct, as a condition of the practice of their profession, and a reasonable procedure applicable to them as a class to insure conformity to that standard, does not deny the equal protection of the laws within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. Dent v. West Virginia, L. Ed. 623; Reetz v. Michigan, Watson v. Maryland, supra.

The judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri is affirmed.

271 U.S. 65
COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
v.
STATE OF NEW YORK et al.
Argued March 4, 1926.
1
This is an original suit in equity brought by the commonwealth of Massachusetts against the state of New York, the city of Rochester in New York, and certain corporations and individuals, to quiet title to land located in the city of Rochester, and to enjoin the city from taking it by eminent domain, or in the alternative, to have the amount of compensation for the taking determined by this court. The case was heard upon bill and answer and the report of a special master appointed to take proofs and to make an advisory report upon the questions of fact raised by the pleadings, except as to the amount of damages to be paid for the property if taken by eminent domain.
1
2
The land in dispute is a narrow strip of about 25 acres fronting upon Lake Ontario within the city limits of Rochester. By the Treaty of Hartford, entered into between New York and Massachusetts December 16, 1786, land within the territorial limits of New York was granted to Massachusetts in private ownership. The title to the land in controversy depends upon the meaning and effect of this treaty, and upon the construction of a subsequent conveyance by Massachusetts of a part of the land thus acquired, through which conveyance the several defendants other than the state of New York derive their title.
2
Massachusetts and New York claimed, under conflicting royal grants, both sovereignty and title of a large area of what is now western New York. The controversy was settled by the Treaty of Hartford by which Massachusetts gave up all its claim to sovereignty over the territory, and its claim to private ownership in part of it, and New York ceded to Massachusetts—
3
4
'the Right of pre-emption of the Soil from the native Indians and all other the Estate, Right, Title and Property (the Right and Title of Government Sovereignty and Jurisdiction excepted) which the State of New York hath * * * in or to all the Lands and Territories within the following Limits and Bounds that is to say, BEGINNING in the north boundary Line of the State of Pennsylvania in the parallel of forty-two degrees of north Latitude at a point distant eighty-two miles west from the north east Corner of the state of Pennsylvania on Delaware River as the said boundary Line hath been run and marked by the Commissioners appointed by the States of Pennsylvania and New York respectively and from the said Point or Place of beginning running on a due meridian north to the boundary Line between the United States of America and the king of Great Britain thence westerly and southerly along the said boundary Line to a meridian which will pass one mile due East from the northern Termination of the Streight or waters between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie thence South along the said Meridian to the South Shore of Lake Ontario thence on the eastern side of the said Streight by a Line always one mile distant from and parallel to the said Streight to Lake Erie thence due west to the boundary Line between the United States and the king of Great Britain thence along the said boundary Line until it meets with the Line of Cession from the State of New York to the United States thence along the said Line of Cession to the northwest corner of the State of Pennsylvama and thence East along the northern boundary Line of the State of Pennsylvania to the said place of beginning.'
4
5
Article 10 of the Treaty provided that Massachusetts might grant the right of pre-emption in the lands thus acquired, 'to any person or persons who by virtue of such Grant shall have good right to extinguish by purchase the claims of the native Indians,' by compliance with certain conditions not now important.
5
6
By act of the Massachusetts Legislature, approved April 1, 1788 (Laws and Res. , it was provided that 'this Commonwealth doth hereby agree, to grant, sell & convey' to Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham, for a purchase price stated in the act, 'all the Right, Title & Demand, which the said Commonwealth has in & to the said Western Territory' ceded to it by the Treaty of Hartford. On July 8, 1788, the Five Indian Nations (Mohawks, Oneidas, Onandagas, Cayugas, and Senecas) executed a deed or treaty extinguishing the Indian claim to the territory described in it and conveying that territory to Phelps and Gorham. The description embraces approximately the east one-third of the territory ceded to Massachusetts by the Treaty of Hartford, and begins at a point 'in the north boundary line of the State of Pennsylvania in the parallel of forty-two degrees north latitude at a point distant eighty-two miles west from the northeast corner of Pennsylvania on Delaware river.' The description proceeds by various metes and bounds to a point on the Genesee river from which, so far as now material, it reads as follows:
6
7
'* * * Thence running in a direction due west twelve miles, thence running in a direction northwardly, so as to be twelve miles distant from the most westward bends of said Genesee River to the shore of the Ontario Lake thence eastwardly along the shores of said Lake to a meridian which will pass through the first point or place of beginning. * * *'
7
8
By legislative act (Laws and Res. , approved November 21, 1788, the commonwealth of Massachusetts granted to Phelps and Gorham the land which had been conveyed by the deed or treaty with the Five Tribes, the description of the land conveyed being, so far as it is now material, identical with that in the conveyance from the Five Tribes, which we have quoted. By treaty between the Six Nations and the United States, executed November 11, 1794, known as the Pickering Treaty (7 Stat. 44), the Indians formally disclaimed any rights in the land lying east of the west line of the Phelps and Gorham tract.
8
9
The several corporate and individual defendants who are in possession of or claim an interest in land now in controversy, derive their title, through mesne conveyances, from Phelps and Gorham, who took under the grants last described, from the Five Tribes and from the commonwealth of Massachusetts, and Massachusetts is not entitled to relief in this suit unless title in the locus quo was acquired by it by the Treaty of Hartford and remained in it after its grant to Phelps and Gorham.
9
10
After the Act approved November 21, 1788, Phelps and Gorham having failed to pay the purchase price stipulated in the Resolve of April 1, 1788, a settlement of the contract or agreement between them and the commonwealth of Massachusetts was effected. By this they retained the easterly one-third of the lands which had been released and confirmed to them by the Five Tribes and later conveyed to them by the commonwealth of Massachusetts, and they released and quitclaimed to the commonwealth all their right and title in the remainder of the land.
10
11
It is established that since the grant to Phelps and Gorham, there has been a shifting of the shore line of Lake Ontario, and that the land now in dispute, which certainly in 1803 and probably at the time of the Phelps and Gorham grant, was under water, north of the shore line of Lake Ontario, is now above water and south of the high-water mark of the lake. Whether the change in the shore line and in the physical condition of the land in question was due wholly to accretion, or partly to accretion and partly to filling, does not clearly appear, and in the view we take of the case is not material.
11
12
The argument of the commonwealth of Massachusetts is that the legal effect of the Hartford Treaty was to release and convey to Massachusetts within the limits of the description in the grant, the bed of Lake Ontario as it then existed, and that by the treaty it acquired title to the land now in dispute; that its grant to Phelps and Gorham, bounding the land conveyed by a line running 'to the Shore of the Ontario Lake; thence eastwardly along the Shores of the said Lake,' carried only to high-water mark; and that title to all the land below high-water mark as it then existed remained in Massachusetts. Even though this contention that the bed of the lake vested in Massachusetts be decided against it, Massachusetts nevertheless takes the position that the land in dispute was due to accretion, and that all the benefits of the accretion accrued to Massachusetts, because it did acquire title to the shore of the lake by the Treaty of Hartford, and did not part with the title to the shore by its grant to Phelps and Gorham.
12
13
The first question which must receive our consideration is whether Massachusetts acquired any title to the bed of Lake Ontario by the Treaty of Hartford. That treaty contained three principal clauses of cession. One granted to New York 'all the claim right and Title which the Commonwealth of Massachusetts hath to the Government Sovereignty and Jurisdiction' in all the lands in controversy between the two states. The second granted to Massachusetts 'the right of preemption of the soil from the native Indians all other the estate, right, title and property (the right and title of government, sovereignty and jurisdiction excepted)' of the state of New York in that part of the land the description of which has already been set forth in detail, and which included that part of the bed of the lake lying within the east and west boundaries of the tract ceded, and south of the international boundary. By the third, with which we are not now concerned, Massachusetts gave up and ceded to New York its claim to private ownership in the remainder of the land in controversy.
13
14
The English possessions in America were claimed by right of discovery. The rights of property and dominion in the lands discovered by those acting under royal authority were held to vest in the crown, which under the principles of the British Constitution was deemed to hold them as a part of the public domain for the benefit of the nation. Upon these principles rest the various English royal charters and grants of territory on the continent of North America. Johnson v. M'Intosh, et seq., As a result of the Revolution, the people of each state became sovereign, and in that capacity acquired the rights of the crown in the public domain (Martin v. Waddell, and it was by the exercise of their sovereign power as states that New York and Massachusetts undertook to make disposition of a portion of their public domain by the grants contained in the Treaty of Hartford.
14
15
The effect of the grant made to Massachusetts in the treaty, so far as concerns the question now presented, depends upon the interpretation of the restrictive language excepting from the operation of the grant the 'right and Title of Government Sovereignty and Jurisdiction' of New York, and of the cotemporaneous grant by Mssachusetts to New York of 'all the claim right and Title which the Commonwealth of Massachusetts hath to the Government Sovereignty and Jurisdiction' over all the lands in controversy. We have to decide whether the grant and reservation to New York of sovereign rights vested or reserved in New York the title to the bed of the navigable waters lying within the exterior limits of the grant made by it to Massachusetts in the same instrument.
15
16
The question is not the vexed one argued at the bar whether there was power in New York to grant the soil beneath its navigable waters in private ownership. Compare Martin v. Waddell, supra, page We need not consider here whether, in such circumstances, there is a limitation on the power of a sovereign state to grant its public domain, nor the nature and extent of the limitation if it exists, for in our view the meaning of the grant itself determines the principal question which we have to decide. In ascertaining that meaning, not only must regard be had to the technical significance of the words used in the grants, but they must be interpreted 'with a view to public convenience, and the avoidance of controversy,' and 'the great object, where it can be distinctly perceived, ought not to be defeated by those technical perplexities which may sometimes influence contracts between individuals'. Marshall, C. J., in Handly's Lessee v. Anthony, L. Ed. 113. The applicable principles of English law then well understood, the object of the grant, contemporaneous construction of it and usage under it for more than a century, all are to be given consideration and weight. Martin v. Waddell, supra.
16
17
The grant made by New York to Massachusetts embraced a vast domain extending more than miles from east to west, and from the northern boundary of Pennsylvania to the Canadian line, comprising about acres of land, largely an unsettled wilderness inhabited by Indians, to which the navigable waters of Lake Ontario were the principal means of access. The purpose of it was, while reserving and securing to New York its rights as a sovereign state in the granted territory, to confer upon Massachusetts the right of pre-emption of the soil from the Indians, and to enable it to make sale of the lands to settlers by conferring on it the power to grant this right of pre-emption.
17
18
It does not appear that the Indians ever had or claimed any rights to the soil under the lake, or that any attempt was made by Massachusetts or those claiming under it to exercise the granted right of pre-emption with respect to the bed of the lake. Nor is there anything to indicate that either party to the treaty contemplated grants of the soil under the water, or intended any such limitation upon the sovereign rights of New York over navigable waters within its territory, as necessarily would have resulted from the grant in private ownership of lands under water.
18
19
It would be difficult to suggest any purpose which the high contracting parties could have had in mind which would have been furthered by a grant to Massachusetts of a fee in the bed of the lake. The right of Massachusetts and her grantees to use the waters of the lake was amply secured and protected by a clause of the treaty, which provided that:
19
20
'Citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts shall * * * at all times hereafter have and enjoy the same and equal Rights respecting the navigation and fishery on and in Lake Ontario and Lake Erie and the Waters communicating from, one to the other * * * as shall from time to time be had and enjoyed by the Citizens of the State of New York. * * *'
20
21
On the other hand, a grant of the soil under water in private ownership would have set material limits on the free exercise of the sovereign control of New York over the navigable waters of the state and on the free use of the principal waterway of the newly settled territory. All these considerations lead to the conclusion that the grants in the Treaty of Hartford did not convey to Massachusetts, which took in private ownership, any title in the bed of the lake, unless the technical language employed in the grants compels us to take an opposite view.
21
22
The fact that the northern limit of the grant to Massachusetts was described as the international boundary, and not the edge of the lake, is not inconsistent with our view of the general purpose of the grant with respect to the lands under water. A map in evidence antedating the treaty shows numerous islands in Lake Ontario within the described area. It was unquestionably the purpose to grant the right of pre-emption of all the islands and, in order to include them, it was necessary to extend the description to the international boundary line. Moreover, it was the avowed purpose of the treaty to settle all controversies with respect to the area described, and these included conflicting claims of sovereignty as well as disputes with respect to proprietary rights. It was necessary, therefore, to make the international boundary a descriptive term in the grants and reservations whereby sovereignty and jurisdiction over the entire tract were being adjusted.
22
23
It is a principle derived from the English common law and firmly established in this country that the title to the soil under navigable waters is in the sovereign, except so far as private rights in it have been acquired by express grant or prescription. Shively v. Bowlby, The rule is applied both to the territory of the United States (Shively v. Bowlby, supra) and to land within the confines of the states, whether they are original states (Johnson v. M'Intosh, supra; Martin v. Waddell, supra) or states admitted into the Union since the adoption of the Constitution (United States v. Holt State Bank, L. Ed. 465). The dominion over navigable waters and property in the soil under them, are so identified with the exercise of the sovereign powers of government that a presumption against their separation from sovereignty must be indulged, in construing all grants by the sovereign, of lands to be held in private ownership. Martin v. Waddell; Shively v. Bowlby, supra. Such grants are peculiarly subject to the rule, applicable generally, that all grants by or to a sovereign government as distinguished from private grants, must be construed so as to diminish the public rights of the sovereign only so far as is made necessary by an unavoidable construction. Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, Shively v. Bowlby, supra. It follows that wherever there is a grant by a state having plenary power to make it, of the rights and title of government and sovereignty over a specified territory, or where, in a grant of land to be held in private ownership by one state within the limits of another, there is a reservation to the grantor state of these sovereign rights, the grant or reservation carries with it, as an incident, title to lands under navigable waters.
23
24
The precise question now under consideration was before this court in Martin v. Waddell, supra. That case involved the title to lands under tidal waters within the territorial limits of New Jersey, which were embraced within the territory granted by royal charters to the Duke of York. By successive conveyances, these lands had been transferred to 24 individuals, the proprietors of East New Jersey, who were invested with the plenary rights and powers of government and ownership which had been conferred on the Duke of York by the original grants. In by formal instrument, the proprietors surrendered to the crown all their rights and powers of government, retaining their rights of private property in the granted territory.
24
25
It was held, in an opinion by Chief Justice Taney, that the relinquishment by the proprietors to the crown, of the rights and powers of government vested in them, carried with it as an incident the title to land under tidal waters; that that title and ownership had passed to the state of New Jersey as an incident to its sovereignty over the territory embraced in the royal grants, and excluded all claims of title to lands under navigable waters by those claiming under grants by the proprietors. The reasoning of the opinion was addressed wholly to the proper interpretation to be placed upon grants or reservations of rights of sovereignty with respect to their operation to transfer title of lands under navigable waters; and it is decisive of this case. It compels the conclusion, which is supported by every consideration that could throw light upon the purpose and intent of the Treaty of Hartford, that the proper construction of the technical language of the treaty (which both granted and reserved to New York the right and title of sovereignty and jurisdiction over the area described) gave to New York, as incident to its sovereignty, title to all lands under navigable waters. See Pollard's Lessees v. Hagan, Coxe v. State. 
25
26
We pass now to the contention of Massachusetts that, even if it did not acquire title to the bed of the lake, it did acquire title to the shore of the lake by the Treaty of Hartford, and that it is entitled to the benefit of all accretion to the shore because it has never parted with its title. This contention depends upon the interpretation of the language of its grant to Phelps and Gorham, of lands bounded by a line described as extending 'to the Shore of the Ontario Lake; thence eastwardly along the Shores of the said Lake'; and it can be sustained only if we conclude that notwithstanding the nature of the grant and the circumstances under which it was made, Massachusetts, after its execution, retained a narrow and undefined ribbon of land extending some 40 miles along the lake front, north of the Phelps and Gorham grant, and separating the latter from the lake.
26
27
That grant embraced more than acres of unsettled land, for the development of which access to the lake was essential. It was made pursuant to the agreement of between Massachusetts and Phelps and Gorham to convey to them all of the property which Massachusetts had acquired under the Treaty of Hartford and pursuant to the Treaty of the Five Nations with Phelps and Gorham of July 8, 1788, purporting to extinguish the Indian claims to 'All that territory or Country of land lying within the State of New York contained within & being parcel of the lands and territory, the right of preemption of the soil whereof from the native Indians was ceded by the State of New York' to Massachusetts by the Treaty of Hartford. There is no conceivable purpose for which it could be supposed that Massachusetts intended to retain such a proprietary interest in the shore as is now claimed, or to deny to its grantees and to settlers in the granted territory access to the great natural waterway upon its northern boundary. We are not dealing here with the disposition of the jus publicum, but with land held by Massachusetts in private ownership and granted by it to private persons. See Georgia v. Chattanooga, It would require clear and unequivocal language so to limit the obvious general purpose and effect of the grant.
27
28
In order thus to restrict its operation, Massachusetts relies on the use of the words 'to the Shore' and 'along the Shores,' instead of 'to the lake' and 'along the lake,' which concededly would have carried to the water's edge; and it is argued that the same effect must be given to these words as when they are used in conveyances granting land bounded by the shore of tidal waters. In this connection, it should be observed that in the Treaty of Hartford the words 'shore' and 'lake' were used synonymously, their choice being determined by convenience of expression. For example, the western boundary in the treaty was described as running from the international boundary line in the middle of Lake Ontario 'to the South Shore of Lake Ontario' and thence continuing south 'to Lake Erie.' In each instance it is clear that the margin of the lake was intended, and it was not meant by the particular use of these phrases to exclude 'the shore' from the grant.
28
29
The 'seashore' is that well-defined area, lying between high-water mark and the low-water mark, of waters in which the tide daily ebbs and flows. The fact that by the English common law, and by the law of those states bounded by tidal waters, the public has rights in the seashore, and that grants extending only to the high-water mark of such waters nevertheless give access to the sea, accounts for the rule, generally recognized and followed, that a grant whose boundaries extend to the 'shore' or 'along the shore' of the sea, carries only to highwater mark. Howard v. Ingersoll, Storer v. Freeman, Am. Dec. Shively v. Bowlby, supra; Kean v. Stetson, 5 Pick, (Mass.) Cortelyou v. Van Brundt, Johns. (N. Y.) But the word 'shore,' even in its application to tidal waters, is subject to construction by the terms of the deed and surrounding circumstances, and may mean the water's edge at low-water mark. Storer v. Freeman, supra; Hathaway v. Wilson, Haskell v. Friend. 
29
30
The application of that rule to conveyances of land bordering upon non-tidal waters is supported by neither reason nor authority. The lack of clear definition, by natural landmarks, of the shore of non-tidal waters, woudl make its application impracticable. It would deny to grantees all access to such waters except on the irregular and infrequent occasions of flood, since there are no public rights in the shores of non-tidal waters, and the abutting owner could not cross the shore to the water without trespass. Such a result would contravene public policy waters, would make its application impracticable. conveyances are normally made. New York has consistently refused to apply the rule to non-tidal waters, holding that a conveyance 'to the shore' or 'along the shore' of such waters carries to the water's edge at low water (Child v. Starr, Halsey v. McCormick, Yates v. Van De Bogert, Stewart v. Turney, A. L. R. , and the local rules for interpreting conveyances should be applied by this court in the absence of an expression of a different purpose (Hardin v. Jordan, Oklahoma v. Texas, L. Ed. 771; Brewer-Elliott Oil Co. v. United States. The same rule is, however, generally followed elsewhere. See Castle v. Elder, Lamb v. Rickets, Daniels v. Cheshire R. R., 20 N. H. 85; Kanouse v. Slockbower, Seaman v. Smith, Slauson v. Goodrich Transp. Co., Burke v. Niles, Stover v. Lavoia. 
30
31
Upon neither of the theories advanced, therefore, does the commonwealth of Massachusetts sustain its claim to the land in question.
31
32
It any further support were required for the conclusion which we reach, it is to be found in the practical construction by the two states of the Treaty of Hartford and of the grants made by Massachusetts immediately following it, and in long-continued acquiescence by Massachusetts in that construction. After the relinquishment by Phelps and Gorham to Massachusetts, of all claim to the westerly two-thirds of the land acquired by Massachusetts under the Treaty of Hartford, Massachusetts, by resolution of its Legislature of March 8, 1791 (Laws and Res. , bargained to sell to Samuel Ogden all the title and interest which the commonwealth then had in the land granted to it by the state of New York, except such parts of the land as then belonged to Phelps and Gorham. Robert Morris succeeded to such rights as Ogden had under this contract. Five several conveyances to Morris, embracing the westerly two-thirds of the tract, were made by a committee appointed for that purpose, and the report of the committee, describing these conveyances in detail, was approved by resolution of the Massachusetts Legislature of June 17, 1991 (Laws and Res. This resolution recited that the committee had been appointed with authority 'to sell & convey * * * the right of pre-emption, & other the title & interest of the Commonwealth to that part of the lands lying in the State of New-York, the right of pre-emption whereof the said State of New-York had ceded to this Common-wealth, & which had not been by them before otherwise ceded or granted.' Although the descriptions in the deeds were so drawn as to exclude from their operation any lands lying east of the western bounds of the Phelps and Gorham grant, this resolution was a clear recognition by the Massachusetts Legislature (as were also the recitals in the several deeds by this committee to Morris) that Massachusetts retained no interest in the shore or in the bed of Lake Ontario east of the westerly boundary of the Phelps and Gorham grant. The deed of the most easterly land conveyed to Robert Morris describes it as bounded on the north by the international boundary line and on the east by lands 'confirmed to Nathaniel Gorham and Oliver Phelps,' but makes no mention of and land on the east belonging to Massachusetts, as would have been appropriate if it had retained any interest in the shore line, east of the land granted to Morris.
32
Morris obtained from the Indians a grant of their right to all such part of the lands ceded by New York to Massachusetts 'as is not included in the Indian purchase made by Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham,' and in a resolve of the Massachusetts Legislature passed March 8, 1804 (Laws and Res. , this Treaty of Morris with the Indians is referred to as having been made with the authority of Massachusetts and as having extinguished all the Indian rights in the land referred to.
33
34
There is no evidence of any official act or any expression of the general court or the Legislature of Masachusetts or of any official of the commonwealth from the time of the Phelps and Gorham grant until the commencement of the present suit, which suggests that Massachusetts had reserved or retained any interest whatever in land under Lake Ontario or upon its shores within the boundaries of that grant. So far as appears, the public authorities of New York have continuously treated the property as other property in the state and as not encumbered by any claim or title of the commonwealth of Massachusetts.
34
35
Long acquiescence in the possession of territory and the exercise of dominion and sovereignty over it may have a controlling effect in the determination of a disputed boundary. Indiana v. Kentucky, L. Ed. 329; Michigan v. Wisconsin, Even though the Treaty of Hartford provided 'that no adverse possession of the said lands for any length of time shall be adjudged a disseisin of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,' it does not affect the interpretation by Massachusetts of her own deeds and acts, or her long-continued acquiescence in that interpretation as persuasive, if not conclusive, evidence of the correctness of the construction which we place upon the deeds themselves.
35
36
The complainant has failed to sustain its claim of title to the land in question. The decree will therefore be for the defendants, and since no public boundary or public ownership was involved, costs are awarded against the complainant. The parties, or either of them if so advised, may, within 30 days, submit the form of a decree to carry this opinion into effect; failing which a decree dismissing the bill, with costs to the defendants, will be entered.

It is so ordered.

271 U.S. 50
ROBERTS & SCHAEFER CO.
v.
EMMERSON, Secretary of State of Illinois.
Argued March 12, 1926.
1
The plaintiff in error, a corporation organized under the laws of Illinois, and doing business in that state, filed its bill in the circuit court of Sangamon county, Illinois, for a mandatory injunction to compel the defendant in error, as secretary of state for Illinois, to accept the sum of $in full discharge of its liability for an annual franchise tax for the year imposed by section of the Illinois Corporation Act, and to enjoin the defendant in error from collecting more than that amount.
1
2
The plaintiff corporation was originally organized with an authorized capital stock of $ divided into one thousand shares of the par value of $ the Illinois Corporation Act was amended so as to allow corporations to issue shares of no par value. Rev. Stats. Ill. (Cahill, as amended by Act of June . Shortly after the passage of this act, the corporation, by amendment of its charter, converted its outstanding stock into preferred stock, and authorized and issued forthwith shares of common stock of no par value.
2
3
Section of the Corporation Act then provided:
3
4
'Each corporation for profit * * * organized under the laws of this state or admitted to do business in this state, and required by this act to make an annual report, shall pay an annual license fee or franchise tax to the secretary of state of five cents on each one hundred dollars of the proportion of its capital stock, authoirzed by its charter in the office of the secretary of state, represented by business transacted and property located in this state. * * *'
4
5
The secretary of state demanded of the plaintiff corporation, under this statute, the payment of five cents on each share of no par stock, on the assumption that for the purpose of the tax, no par shares were to be valued at $ The plaintiff took the position that there was no statutory authority for the assessment of the tax on that basis, and that, since its no par value shares had been issued as 'fully paid up and nonassessable upon the payment of five dollars for each share in cash or property,' it was liable to a tax only on the basis of that valuation, and tendered the tax so computed to the secretary of state. In a mandamus proceeding brought by the plaintiff corporation, the Supreme Court of Illinois upheld this contention and ordered the secretary of state to accept the lesser sum in satisfaction of the tax. People ex rel. Roberts & Schaefer Co. v. Emmerson. 
5
6
After this decision, the Legislature of Illinois amended section by adding the sentence:
6
7
'In the event that the corporation has stock of no par value, its shares, for the purpose of fixing such fee, shall be considered to be of the par value of $per share.' The plaintiff's bill in the case before us attacks the validity of the franchise tax imposed on it pursuant to this amendment, on the ground that the amendment is unconstitutional. The circuit court dismissed the bill for want of equity. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed the judgment (, holding that the tax was lawfully assessed. The plaintiff comes here on writ of error. Judicial Code, § .
7
8
It is urged that the selection of authorized capital stock as the basis for the franchise tax or license fee is arbitrary, and has no tendency to procure equality, and results in imposing different rates of taxation on corporations having the same issued capital stock holding the same amount of property and doing the same amount of business, whenever they have different amounts of authorized capital stock; that the mere number of authorized no par value shares regardless of their value or the amount of money or property for which they are or may be issued, is not a reasonable basis for a franchise tax, but is wholly arbitrary; that the provision of section assigning an arbitrary valuation of $per share to no par stock for the purpose of computing the tax in question, results in a discrimination against corporations which issue shares of no par value, and in favor of those which issue them at a par value. Reliance is also placed on the invalidity of the amendment as impairing the obligation of contract (Constitution, art. 1, § 10) in that the shares of the plaintiff were issued before the amendment of section and at a time when, it is alleged, the law of Illinois provided that, for the purpose of this tax, no par stock was to be valued at the amount for which it was actually issued.
8
9
In support of the argument that authorized capital stock is not a permissible basis for a franchise tax, the plaintiff relies on Air-Way Electric Appliance Corp. v. Day, That case dealt with a privilege tax, laid by Ohio on a foreign corporation engaged in interstate and intrastate commerce in that and other states. It was held that a tax on such a corporation for the privilege of doing business in Ohio, where the tax was measured by that proportion of its total authorized capital stock which its business done and property owned in Ohio bore to its total business done and property owned everywhere, was invalid as an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, and a denial of the equal protection of the laws. While one factor in the computation of the tax was properly the proportion of the corporation's business done and property owned within the state, the other factor was the amount of its authorized capital stock, only a part of which had actually been issued. The authority to issue its capital stock was a privilege conferred by another state and bore no relation to any franchise granted to it by the state of Ohio or to its business and property within that state. When authorized capital stock is taken as the basis of the tax, variations in the amount of the tax are obtained, according as the corporation has a large or small amount of unissued capital stock. This was held, in the Air-Way Case, to be an unconstitutional discrimination, since it resulted in a tax larger than the tax imposed on other corporations with like privileges and like business and property within the state, but with a smaller capital authorized under the laws of the state of their creation.
9
10
In the present case, the plaintiff corporation is organized and does all its business in Illinois. We cannot say that a state may not impose a franchise tax on a domestic corporation, measured by its authorized capital stock. See Kansas City Ry. v. Kansas, Kansas City v. Stiles, L. Ed. 176.
10
11
But the plaintiff is not in a position to raise this question. As this court has often held, one who challenges the validity of state taxation on the ground that it violates the equal protection clause, cannot rely on theoretical inequalities, or such as do not affect him, but must show that he is himself affected unfavorably by the discrimination of which he complains. See Western Union Tel. Co. v. Massachusetts, L. Ed. 790; Gast Realty Co. v. Schneider Granite Co., L. Ed. 523; Withnell v. Ruecking Const. Co., L. Ed. 479; Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, The plaintiff cannot complain that the tax is measured by authorized, instead of issued, capital stock, because all of its authoirzed capital stock has been issued. Any discrimination that exists operates, therefore, in plaintiff's favor.
11
12
It is argued that the tax imposed is a tax at a flat rate per share on no par value stock, regardless of its value, so that different corporations are taxed at different amounts although their no par stock was issued for the same total amount of capital; and that the tax is based upon an unreasonable and discriminatory classification in which no par value stock is placed in one class and taxed at an arbitrary valuation of $per share, while par value stock is placed in another class and taxed at the value at which it is authorized to be issued. Both arguments leave out of account the nature of the tax and the essential differences between the two classes of stock.
12
13
The tax is imposed as a franchise tax upon a domestic corporation doing business only withint the state. It spower to issue shares of both classes is derived from the laws of Illinois. The amount which may be issued; the manner of issue; the liability of holders of these shares and all other incidents of them, are regulated by the law of that state. The tax is not a property tax imposed on shares of stock or on the assets of the corporation. within the state. Its power to issue shares which includes the privilege, whether exercised or not, of issuing and using when issued, a particular kind of stock known as 'no par value stock.' As the stock may, under the statute, be issued for as much as $a share, if the company so chooses, the statute fixes the maximum extent to which the privilege may be exercised as the basis for computing the tax.
13
14
Neither this privilege nor the corresponding privilege of issuing par value stock bears any necessary relation to the value of the stock or the assets of the corporation; and the tax is imposed whether or not the stock is issued and without regard to the value of the stock or of the corporate property. We cannot say that the value of the corporation's franchise may not be measured by the number of no par shares which may be issued rather than their value when issued. The only question with which we need be concerned is whether there are such differences between the two privileges to issue the two classes of stock, as to constitute a proper basis for classification for purposes of taxation, so that the amount of the tax in the one case may be based on the issue price of the stock, and in the other upon the maximum price at which it may be issued regardless of the price at which it actually is issued.
14
15
That there are differences of practical importance between the two classes of stock and the privileges of issuing and using them is sufficiently evidenced by the very general adoption of legislation authorizing the issue of no par value stock, and by the widespread practice of issuing that type of corporate shares.
15
16
The nature of the more important of these differences sufficiently appears from the provisions of the Illinois statute as interpreted and applied in the opinion below in the Supreme Court of Illinois. Par value stock may be issued only for money or property equivalent to the par value. No par value stock may be issued for money or property of any amount or value, provided it is not less than $5 nor more than $per share. From this it follows that all the par value stock of an authorized class must be issued, if issued at all, at a uniform value or price, while no par value stock may be issued from time to time at different prices or values, although the holders of all these shares are entitled to share equally in the distribution of profits of the corporation. The liability of stockholders of the two classes of stock for the debts of the corporation may be different, and greater facility is permitted in the issuance and marketing of no par value shares than in the case of stock having a par value.
16
17
These differences, both in the legal incidents and in the practical uses of the two classes of stock, not only are a basis for classification of them for purposes of taxation, but make unavoidable certain differences in the method of assessing this tax. Authorized capital stock cannot well be used as the measure of a tax unless some arbitrary value is assigned to the no par shares; for they may be issued from time to time at varying prices, and, until issued, they cannot have any value. To require the stock to be issued at a value fixed in advance of its issue, and to make that value the basis of the tax, would in effect abolish no par stock. Because of the essential differences between the two kinds of stock, it is difficult to conceive of any other method of assessing the tax which would save the character of no par value stock and not result in similar inequalities.
17
18
The inequalities complained of result from a classification which, being founded upon real differences, is not unreasonable, and the discrimination which results from it it not arbitrary or prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment. It is enough that the classification is reasonably founded upon or related to some permissible policy of taxation. Watson v. State Comptroller, L. Ed. 170; Pacific Express Co. v. Seibert, American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, Clement National Bank v. Vermont, L. Ed. 147. Only brief consideration need be given to the contention that the amendment of section of the Illinois Corporation Act impairs the obligation of contract. That plaintiff's stock when issued was not subject to the tax computed at the rate of $per share, which was later authorized by section as amended, was decided in Roberts & Schaefer Co. v. Emmerson, The fact that the corporation issued its stock under statutes which were later so interpreted can give rise to no inference that the state contracted not to increase or otherwise modify the tax. See Home Ins. Co. v. City Council, Memphis Gas Co. v. Shelby County, L. Ed. 976; Wisconsin & Michigan R. Co. v. Powers, Seton Hall College v. South Orange, L. Ed. 170.
18
19
Even if the taxing statute be deemed to be a part of its corporate charter, it was nevertheless subject to the provisions of section of the Illinois General Corporation Act reserving to the Legislature the power 'to amend, repeal or modify this act at pleasure.'
19
20
Judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is affirmed.

BOYD
v.
UNITED STATES.
Argued Dec. 1, 1925.
1
This was a prosecution under Harrison Anti-Narcotic Act, c. as amended by chapter (Comp. St. Comp. St. Ann. Supp. et seq.). The indictment contained thirteen counts. The defendant was acquitted on seven and convicted on six, and the conviction was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. The case is here on writ of certiorari.
1
2
In each of the six counts the defendant was described as a physician, registered as such under the act, and credited with paying the special tax required of physicians, and was charged with unlawfully dispensing-through his written prescription-a stated quantity of morphine sulphate to a particular person, in the absence of a written order from the recipient on an authorized form, and not in the course of professional practice only, but to enable the recipient to obtain, as actually wad done, possession of that quantity of the drug contrary to law. The prescriptions as set forth were: To Annie Davis, an addict to the use of the drug for 21 years, 48 grains on August 2, 48 grains on August 9, and 40 grains on August 13, all in 1923; and to Frank O'Hara, an addict for 18 years, 30 grains on August 18, 30 grains on August 24, and 30 grains on August 30, all in 1923.
2
3
On the trial the government proved and the defendant admitted that he was a physician, was registered under the act, and had paid the special tax required of a physician; that he issued the prescriptions without written orders from the recipients on an authorized form; that he intended the recipients should obtain the during in the quantities specified from a local dealer; that they did so obtain it under the prescriptions; that they had been coming to the defendant for long periods, and he knew they were confirmed addicts, whose will had come to be subservient to their acquired craving for the drug; that they were in a position after the prescriptions were filled where they could administer the drug to themselves according to their own inclinations, or dispose of it to others; and that each prescription was for a quantity greatly in excess of what would be appropriate for immediate administration.
3
4
The disputed question was whether the defendant issued the prescriptions in good faith, in the course of his professional practice. On this point the evidence was conflicting. That for the government tended strongly to show that the prescriptions were for quantities many times in excess of what, according to any fair medical standard, reasonably could be put into the possession of confirmed addicts, even when treating them for the addiction, or endeavoring to relieve them from suffering incident to it, and that the prescriptions could only have been issued to enable the recipients to indulge their acquired longing for the drug and its effects. Much of that for the defendant tended to show that he issued the prescriptions in good faith, in the course of professionally treating the recipients for their addiction, and endeavoring to relieve them from its incidents. But some of the evidence in his behalf was pronouncedly corroborative of that for the government. Thus the testimony of other physicians whom he called as witnesses, while tending to approve his asserted method of treatment, also tended to show that the prescriptions in question were grossly excessive and unreasonable, according to any fair medical standard; and his personal testimony contained contradictions and admissions tending materially to detract from his claim of good faith. Among other things, his testimony showed that he was both distributing and prescribing most unusual quantities of the drug; that he purchased and distributed over grains from May 1 to September 30, 1923; and that he issued prescriptions on much the same scale during that period. There was much testimony that his professional and private character were good and widely respected.
4
5
In its charge to the jury the court said that the determinative question was whether the defendant issued the prescriptions in good faith 'as a physician to his patients in the course of his professional practice only'; that, if they were issued in good faith, 'for the purpose of curing disease or relieving suffering,' he should be acquitted; and that if, on the evidence, that question was left in reasonable doubt, he should be given the benefit of the doubt and acquitted. There was more along this line, in the course of which the court said that it was admissible for the defendant in his professional practice to prescribe the drug either for 'the curing of morphinism,' or for 'the relief of suffering from morphinism,' if he did so in good faith, and that in determining the question of his good faith the jury should consider the quantity prescribed-whether it conformed to medical standards, and, if it was in excess of such standards, whether there was reason or occasion for the excess. Thus far the charge was in accord with what this court said in Linder v. United States, A. L. R. 229, where prior decisions were reviewed and explained.
5
6
Further on in the charge the court indicated that it was not admissible for the defendant to issue prescriptions to a known addict 'for amounts of morphine for a great number of doses, more than was sufficient for the necessity of any one particular administration of it.' Complaint is now made of this. It appears ambiguous, and, if not taken with the rest of the charge, might be regarded as meaning that it never is admissible for a physician, in treating an addict, to give him a prescription for a greater quantity than is reasonably appropriate for a single dose or administration. So understood, the statement would be plainly in conflict with what this court said in the Linder Case. But we think it could not well have been so understood in this instance. It did not stand alone, but was to be taken in connection with what preceded it, and also with what followed. At the conclusion of the charge counsel for the defendant made no objection and took no exception to it, but simply asked the court to add the following, which was done:
6
7
'I am requested to say to you, gentlemen, that in determining whether or not the defendant in prescribing morphine to his patients was honestly seeking to cure them of the morphine habit, while applying his curative remedies, it is not necessary for the jury to believe that defendant's treatment would cure the morphine habit, but it is sufficient if defendant honestly believed his remedy was a cure for this disease.'
7
8
'I instruct you that, if this is true, regardless of whether the course of treatment given by this defendant is a cure, the question is: Was he honestly and in good faith in the course of his professional practice and in an effort to cure disease issuing these prescriptions?'
8
9
With that addition the charge elicited no criticism or objection from the defendant, although there was full opportunity therefor. It evidently was regarded as consistent and satisfactory. Besides, in view of what was said in other parts of the charge, we are justified in assuming that, had the court's attention been particularly drawn at the time to the part complained of now, it would have been put in better form. Certainly, after permitting it to pass as satisfactory then, the defendant is not now in a position to object to it. McDermott v. Severe, L. Ed. 1162; United States v. U. S. Fidelity Co., L. Ed. 696; Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. v. Earnest, Ann. Cas.

This disposes of the only contention made by the defendant in this court.

NEW YORK LIFE INS. CO.
v.
EDWARDS, Collector of Internal Revenue. EDWARDS, Collector of internal Revenue, v. NEW YORK LIFE INS. CO.
Argued March 23, 1926.
1
The Insurance Company brought suit in the District Court at New York to recover of Edwards, collector, the alleged excessive sum demanded of it as income tax for the year and obtained judgment for a part. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this, except as to one item. Both parties are here by certiorari, and five questions require consideration. All involve the construction or application of the Revenue Act of October Section 2 G(a) imposed an annual tax of one per centum upon the net income of 'every insurance company organized in the United States,' and (b) directed—
1
2
'Such net income shall be ascertained by deducting from the gross amount of the income of such * * * insurance company, received within the year from all sources, (first) all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid within the year in the maintenance and operation of its business and properties, including rentals or other payments required to be made as a condition to the continued use or possession of property; (second) all losses actually sustained within the year and not compensated by insurance or otherwise, including a reasonable allowance for depreciation by use, wear and tear of property, if any; * * * and in case of insurance companies the net addition, if any, required by law to be made within the year to reserve funds and the sums other than dividends paid within the year on policy and annuity contracts: Provided, that * * * life insurance companies shall not include as income in any year such portion of any actual premium received from any individual policyholder as shall have been paid back or credited to such individual policyholder, or treated as an abatement of premium of such individual policyholder, within such year. * * *'

1. The company, a New York corporation without capital stock, does business on the mutual level premium plan and issues both 'annual dividend' and 'deferred dividend' policies. Under this plan each policy holder pays annually in advance a fixed sum which, when added to like payments by others, probably will create a fund larger than necessary to meet all the maturing policies and estimated expenses. At the end of each year the actual insurance costs and expenses incurred are ascertained. The difference between their sum and the total of advance payments and other income, then becomes the 'overpayment' or surplus fund for immediate pro rata distribution among policy holders as dividends or for such future disposition as the contracts provide. An 'annual dividend' policy holder receives his proportionate part of this fund each year in cash or as a credit upon or abatement of his next premium. 'Deferred dividend,' or, as sometimes called, 'distribution,' policies provide—

'That no dividend or surplus shall be allowed or paid upon this policy, unless the insured shall survive until completion of its distribution period, and unless this policy shall then be in force. That surplus or profits derived from such policies on the distribution policy plan as shall not be in force at the date of the completion of their respective distribution periods, shall be apportioned among such policies as shall complete the distribution periods.' Accordingly all overpayments by deferred dividend policy holders must await apportionment until the prescribed period ends, and no one of them will receive anything therefrom if his policy lapses or if he dies before that time. The whole of this fund goes to the survivors.
4
5
Overpayments by deferred dividend policy holders for amounted to $ The collector refused to deduct this sum from the total receipts, and demanded the prescribed tax of 1 per centum thereon. We think he acted properly. Both courts below so held.

6
The applicable doctrine was much considered in Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Lederer, We there pointed out the probable reason for the permitted noninclusion in the net income of a life insurance company of 'such portion of any actual premium received from any individual policy holder as shall have been paid back or credited to such individual policy holder, or treated as an abatement of premium of such individual policy holder, within such year.' Here it is insisted that within the meaning of the quoted provision each deferred dividend policy holder's overpayment was actually credited to him during the year; but we cannot accept this theory. The aggregate of all such payments was held for distribution among policy holders alive at the end of the period. The receipts for the year were not really diminished.

2. The company owned many bonds, etc., payable at future dates, purchased at prices above their par values, and to amortize these premiums a fund was set up. It claimed that an addition to this fund should be deducted from gross receipts. The District Court thought the claim well founded, but the Circuit Court of Appeals took another view. Unless the addition amounted to a loss 'actually sustained within the year' no deduction could be made therefor. Obviously, no actual ascertainable loss had occurred. All of the securities might have been sold thereafter above cost. The result of the venture could not be known until they were either sold or paid off. the company introduced a clause into some policies by which it agreed to waive payments of premiums after proof of total and permanent disability. The estimated value on December 31, 1913, of future premiums so waived amounted to $ It claimed this should be added to the reserve fund and deducted from gross income. Insurance companies may deduct 'the net addition, if any, required by law to be made within the year to reserve funds.'
7
8
The pertinent portion of the agreed statement of facts follows:
8
the plaintiff introduced into some of its contracts of insurance a clause under which it agreed that upon receipt, before default in the payment of premium, of due proof that the insured had become totally and permanently disabled, the plaintiff would waive payment of any premium thereafter falling due. In taking its account at the end of the calendar year the plaintiff had then received due proof that the insured under a number of these policies were totally and permanently disabled in accordance with the terms of said contracts providing for the waiver of the payment of future premiums. The value at December 31, of the futute premiums waived on account of total and permanent disability was the sum of $ The value at December 31, 1912, of the future premiums so waived was the sum of $.
9
10
In the calculation of the general reserve fund at the end of any calendar year, the company and the insurance department of the state of New York make the computation by deducting from the value of the contractual benefits under each policy the then value of all future premiums under the policy. The general reserve fund of the plaintiff stated in its annual statement is thus the reserve computed by deducting the value of all future premiums from the valuation of all policy obligations. But, under the policies on the lives of those who had become totally and permanently disabled and whose contracts provided for the waiver of the payment of future premiums, no future premiums will be received by the plaintiff, and therefore the net reserve reported for these policies in understated to the extent of the value of these future premiums.
10
11
In the official blank for the plaintiff's annual statement to be used at December 31, 1913, there was an item of liabilities, No. 9-a, entitled 'Present Value of Future Premiums Waived on Account of Total and Permanent Disability,' and in the plaintiff's annual statement the sum reported under this item was $at December 31, 1913. The sum of $reported under item No. 9-a was not included in the plaintiff's general reserve. In the official blank for use at December 31, 1912, ther was no such item as No. 9-a, and the plaintiff included the value at December 31, 1912, of future premiums waived on account of total and permanent disability (viz. $ as a part of the general reserve at that date.
11
12
If said sum of $had not been included as a part of the general reserve at December 31, 1912, the net addition to the value of future premiums waived on account of total and permanent disability would have been the excess of $ Since, however, owing to the change in the form of the official blank, the said $was deducted as a part of the plaintiff's general reserve in obtaining the net addition to the general reserve, the sum to use in obtaining the net addition to the value of future premiums waived on account of total and permanent disability in the sum of $.
12
13
The Circuit Court of Appeals held the deduction should have been allowed, but we think otherwise.
13
14
The superintendent of insurance of New York required this item to be reported as a liability and did not treat it as part of the general reserve. Upon the agreed facts we cannot say that it was part of any reserve required by the laws of the New York. There is nothing to show how 'the value of the contractual benefits' under these policies was arrived at and, considering the evidence presented, we must accept the superintendent's conclusion. The company has not shown enough to establish its right to the exemption.
14
 A number of policy holders died during the calendar year, but their deaths were not reported before it terminated. The superintendent of insurance required the company to set aside a special fund to meet these unreported losses, and it claimed that this was an addition to the reserve fund required by law. We think this claim was properly rejected by the commissioner, although the courts below held otherwise. McCoach v. Insurance Co. of North America, and United States v. Boston Insurance Co., L. Ed. 232 (November , pointed out that the net addition, if any, required by law to be made within the year to reserve funds,' does not necessarily include whatever a state official may so designate; that 'reserve funds' has a technical meaning. It is unnecessary now to amplify what was there said. The item under consideration represented a liability and not something reserved from premiums to meet policy obligations at maturity.
15
 The company also claimed deduction for additions to a fund set aside to provide for payment of annuities to former soliciting agents as provided by their contracts of employment. The Commissioner properly rejected this item, although both courts below held a different view. The agreed statement of facts shows:
16
17
The plaintiff has a form of contract of employment with many of its soliciting agents under which, if such agents for a period of 20 years continuously devote their entire time, talents and energies in soliciting applications for insurance, and if they shall for the 20 years accomplish certain prescribed minimum results, then at the end of twenty years of such service each such agent becomes entitled to an income for life payable monthly, the amount of the payment being based upon the results obtained by each such agent during the twenty year period. The laws of New York require the superintendent of insurance, in making a valuation of the obligations of the plaintiff to value annuities on the standard of McClintock's 'Table of Mortality among Annuitants,' with interest not exceeding four per centum per annum. Said superintendent of insurance after making an examination of the plaintiff and valuing its liabilities, required the plaintiff to carry, and it does carry, a fund to meet its said liabilities on said contracts with its soliciting agents, and this fund it increased during the year The net addition to said fund for said year was the sum of $ which the plaintiff, in making its said return deducted from gross income under that clause of the law which authorizes a life insurance corporation to deduct the net addition required by law to be made within the year to reserve funds. But in amending said return the Commissioner refused to allow said deduction, and thereby made the plaintiff's net income for the year appear to be $more than it would have been if said deduction had been allowed, and he assessed and collected an additional tax on account thereof accordingly in the sum of $ which forms a part of the tax in controversy in this suit.
17
18
As pointed out above, the term 'reserve funds,' in the taxing act, has a technical meaning. The compensation which an insurance company agrees to pay soliciting agents has no relation to the reserve held to meet maturing policies, and when it sets aside a fund to provide payments to such agents this cannot be regarded as a reserve within intendment of the statute.
18
19
The judgment below must be reversed. The cause will be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in harmony with this opinion.

PATTERSON et al.
v.
MOBILE GAS CO.
Argued March 19, 1926.
1
The record in this cause has been made up with such disregard of the rules that we cannot undertake to examine the evidence or to discuss seriatim the 34 jumbled assignments of error. It would be permissible to dismiss the appeal, Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., L. Ed. 538; but, considering the public interest and with purpose to prevent any serious miscarriage of justice, we have examined the pleadings, the master's report, the opinions and the decrees. In the circumstances we think the proper course is to modify and then to affirm the decree of the court below.
1
2
By an original bill of August 14, 1922, the gas company asked that members of the Alabama Public Service Commission be restrained from attempting to enforce a rate schedule which it alleged was confiscatory.
2
3
A supplemental bill, filed April 18, 1923, after referring to the original bill and proceedings thereunder, among other things, alleged: That, as provided by the Act of the Alabama Legislature approved October (Sp. Sess.) p. 38) the commission ascertained and declared the value of the company's property for rate-making purposes as of December 31, 1921, at the latter's request and expense. That this valuation was made under a valid contract with the state and she was obligated to accept it for rate-making purposes. That by an unconstitutional act approved February (Gen. Acts 1923, p. 62), the Legislature undertook to authorize, and the commission intended to make, another valuation. That so to do would violate the contract which the state deliberately entered into and greatly injure the company. In addition to the relief originally asked the prayer was for a decree declaring the commission's valuation final for all rate-making purposes and the challenged act invalid. Also for an injunction restraining the commission from attempting to establish any new valuation for rate-making purposes.
3
4
Upon application for an injunction under the supplemental bill the District Court-composed of two Circuit Judges and one District Judge-held (June that no continuing contract between the state and the company resulted from the commission's action in respect of the first valuation and refused to enjoin the proposed revaluation. District Judge Clayton expressed another view.
4
5
Later-October the District Court, Judge Clayton only presiding, entered the following final decree:
5
6
(1) That the value of the properties of the Mobile Gas Company as of December 31, 1921, has been definitely fixed for the future rate-making purpose by contract entered into by the state of Alabama, acting by and through the Alabama Public Service Commission, on the one part, and the Mobile Gas Company, on the other part, and that the defendants in this case and their successors in office are hereby forever enjoined from attempting to impair the obligations of this contract by failing or refusing to accept the said valuation as a permanent basic valuation as of December 31, 1921, for all future rate-making purposes.
6
7
(2) Also that the tariff of rates established by the Alabama Public Service Commission, by its order of July 24, 1922, is confiscatory and void, and further that the Mobile Gas Company is entitled to earn a net profit of 8 per cent. per annum upon $ consisting of $ which was established as the permanent basic valuation of the plaintiff's property as of December which covers additions to property from December 31, 1921, to December 31, 1922, and that in ascertaining said net profit the plaintiff must be allowed a depreciation reserve of 2 1/2 per cent. upon the value of the property, and a further credit of $ amortized over a period of five years, on account of the expenses incurred in resisting the enforcement of said confiscatory tariff of rates, and also to a further credit of $ amortized over a period of five years, being losses imposed upon the plaintiff between August 12, 1920, and November 1, 1920, by reason of the refusal of the Alabama Public Service Commission to permit the operation of a schedule of rates filed by the plaintiff on August 12, 1920.
7
8
(3) That defendants Andrew G. Patterson, Fitzhugh Lee, and Frank P. Morgan, and their successors in office, as members of the Alabama Public Service Commission, be and and they are hereby forever enjoined from enforcing or attempting to enforce the said tariff of rates promulgated by the order of the Alabama Public Service Commission on July 24, 1922, or from establishing or attempting to enforce any other tariff of rates which is insufficient to produce a return of 8 per cent. per annum upon the then value of the plaintiff's properties used and useful in the public service, assuming as a basic valuation of said company's property on the 31st day of December, 1922, the sum of $ The court reserves the power to modify said injunction at any time, when by reason of changed conditions any tariff of rates, the establishment and enforcement of which is hereby forbidden, may become compensatory.
8
9
(4) Also that the defendants, and their successors in office, are hereby forever enjoined from compelling or attempting to compel the plaintiff to submit its properties, books, documents, accounts, and vouchers to examination by the Alabama Public Service Commission, or its representatives, for the purpose of repudiating or in any wise impairing the valuation of the plaintiff's properties as of the 31st day of December, 1921, as a basic valuation for future rate-making purposes.
9
10
(5) Also that a writ of permanent injunction issue from this court in accordance with this decree.
10
11
(6) The exceptions to the report of the special master are hereby overruled, and the said report is hereby approved and confirmed.
11
12
To that portion of this decree which adjudged the rate schedule, prescribed by the commission's order of July 24, 1922, confiscatory, and enjoined any attempt to enforce it, we find no reason to object, and to that extent it is affirmed.
12
13
The remaining portions of the decree must be eliminated. We think they were improvident and go materially beyond what the circumstances require. But whether or not they announce correct conclusions of law we do not decide. The matters to which they relate are left open and subject to further and future original consideration by any proper tribunal. While within his powers as the law then stood, the District Judge went very far when he entirely disregarded the views of the Circuit Judges who sat on the specifically constituted court. The statute was materially changed by the Act of February (Comp. St. Supp. , and now causes like this must be finally adjudicated by a court composed of three judges. To such a court we think the questions to which those portions of the decree relate ought to go before we undertake finally to pass upon them.
13
14
The approved portion of the decree will protect the company against immediate danger of serious injury, and if hereafter its rights are threatened by further unlawful interference, application for relief may be made to the proper specially constituted District Court.
14
15
With the indicated modifications the decree below is affirmed. All costs will be charged against the appellants.

Mr. Justice SANFORD concurs in the result.

ISELIN et al.
v.
UNITED STATES.
Argued April 29, 1926.
1
The appellants, partners as William Iselin & Co., sued the United States for $for breach of a warranty of quality in a sale to them by the United States of airplane linen. On January 15, 1920, the United States, through the Materials Disposal and Salvage Division of the office of the Director of Air Service, advertised for bids for yards of aircraft linen, to be submitted February 2, 1920. The bidders were to be notified February 5th of the yardage awarded, and were then to forward a check for 10 per cent. of the purchase price, remainder within 30 days. The advertisement also stated that the materials would be sold 'as is' at points of storage, that inspection was invited, that specifications and quantities on hand were based upon best information available, but that no guaranty on behalf of the government was given.
1
2
The representative of the appellants at New York on February 2, 1920, after seeing the advertisement, sent the following letter to the Salvage Division, office of the Director of Air Service, Washington:
2
3
'I herewith submit my firm offer for approximately yards of 38-inch grade A natural brown Irish airplane linen. Specifications: Minimum threads, warp and filling, 90. Maximum threads, warp and filled, Minimum weight, 4.5 oz. per square yard. Average length of pieces from 60 to 80 yards, at 93 cents per yard, f. o. b. cars at present location. Said linen as per sample submitted; goods to be firsts. This offer is for immediate acceptance on usual government terms.'
3
4
Under date of February 10th, there was sent to the plaintiff's representative the following communication from the New York office of the Salvage Division:
4
5
'This is to advise you that Washington has awarded you yards of 38-inch grade A airplane linen at 93 cents per yard. This linen is listed on sheet No. yards, and sheet No. yards.
5
6
'2. Inasmuch as we have your check for $per cent. of the sale, it is requested that you send this office certified check for $to cover the balance due, together with your shipping directions.
6
7
'3. This check should be drawn in favor of 'Disbursing Officer, Air Service,' marking envelope for the attention of the Materials Disposal and Salvage Division, Madison Ave., N. Y. C.
7
8
'4. Attention is invited to the following rule of the Air Service, which requires that payment be made promptly and material removed within 30 days of award.'
8
9
It does not appear, and it is not claimed, that there was any acceptance of appellant's bid February 2d otherwise than as embodied in the communication last above quoted.
9
10
Upon resale of the linen, and appellants found that it was not of the quality of 'firsts' and brought this suit. The linen delivered was of grade A, which term describes a particular texture. The terms 'firsts' and 'seconds' are terms of quality.
10
11
The only question in this case is whether the expression, 'Said linen as per sample submitted; goods to be firsts,' contained in the letter of February 2d was accepted so as to bind the government to a warranty that the linen sold was to be of first quality.
11
12
We do not think that the letter of February 10th was an acceptance of the offer of February 2d. It does not acknowledge its receipt. It does not purport to be an answer to it. It differs from it in the yardage of the linen mentioned by yards. It contains no reference to the quality of the linen. It refers to a check for 10 per cent. of the price bid on yards of linen, which could not have been sent in the letter of February 2d, for it was for a less amount. This shows, as indeed the counsel for the appellants himself points out, that there must have been some negotiations, or inquiries or communications between the appellants and the government after the letter of February 2d before the exact amounts of the linen and the deposit check could be fixed. The contract is not found in the letter of February 2d. It is evidenced by the tender of the deposit check, by the letter of February 10th only, and by the payment of the balance due on the contract price. It is reasonable to infer that the letter of February 10th was a belated award under the advertisement rather than an acceptance of the letter of February 2d.
12
13
It is well settled that a proposal to accept, or an acceptance upon terms varying from those offered, is a rejection of the offer, and puts an end to the negotiation, unless the party who made the original offer renews it, or assents to the modification suggested. Beaumont v. Prieto, L. Ed. Minneapolis Railway v. Columbus Rolling Mill, L. Ed. National Bank v. Hall, Carr v. Duval, Eliason v. Henshaw, L. Ed. 556.
13
14
We must conclude that the government never entered into a warranty of the quality of the linen and so, that no obligation arose from a breach. The judgment of the Court of Claims is affirmed.

271 U.S. 142
UNITED STATES ex rel. HUGHES
v.
GAULT, U. S. Marshal.
Argued April 22, 1926.
1
The relator was indicted for violation of the Anti-Trust Act of July , in the Eastern Division of the Northern District of Ohio. He appeared, upon notice, before a commissioner of Ottumwa, Iowa, and after a hearing he was ordered to be held for removal. Rev. Stat. § . The relator thereupon applied to the judges of the District Court for a writ of habeas corpus on the grounds that the indictment was band and that the Commissioner rejected evidence that the relator was innocent and that therefore there was no probable cause to believe him guilty of a crime in Ohio. He also prayed for a writ of certiorari to bring the proceedings below before the Court. The writs were issued and after a hearing the District Court denied the relator his discharge and directed an order of removal to be prepared. The relator appeals under section of the Judicial Code, Act March (Comp. St. § , before the Act of February, went into effect. The grounds alleged are that by the refusal to hold that the indictment did not show probable cause to believe the relator guilty and that by the exclusion of the evidence the relator was deprived of his right to be tried in the District wherein the crime was committed, Constitution, art. 3, § 2, and Amendment 6, and that he was detained without due process of law. Amendment 5.
1
2
The Constitution does not require any preliminary hearing before a person charged with a crime against the United States is brought into the Court having jurisdiction of the charge. There he may deny the jurisdiction of the Court as he may deny his guilt, and the Constitution is satisfied by his right to contest it there. With immaterial exceptions any one in the United States is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and may be required to stand trial wherever he is alleged to have committed the crime. In Tinsley v. Treat, L. Ed. the conclusion is not that the appellant by being denied the right to present any evidence was deprived of his rights under the Constitution, but that he was denied 'a right secured by statute under the Constitution.'
2
3
As that instrument does not provide for bringing the accused into the power of the Court authorized to try him, a statute was necessary and is found in Rev. Stat. § This might have been interpreted as contemplating a summary order without other hearing than was necessary, when there was an indictment, to show that fact and that the person present was the person charged. The hardship of removal, however, has grown with the growth of the United States, and there is a natural desire to prevent it when possible, if a preliminary sifting will show that there is no probable cause for the charge. Accordingly it is held that the District Judge on application to remove acts judicially and that probable cause must be shown. Beavers v. Henkel, L. Ed. Tinsley v. Treat, L. Ed. It is to be noticed however that 'where any offender * * * is committed in any district other than that where the offense is to be tried. it shall be the duty of the judge of the district where such offender * * * is imprisoned, seasonably to issue, and of the marshal to execute, a warrant for his removal,' etc. But the commitment, supposed by these words already to have taken place, is entrusted not only to judges and commissioners of the United States, and judges of state courts, but to any 'mayor of a city, justice of the peace, or other magistrate, of any State where he may be found.' Obviously, in order to make it the duty of the judge to issue the warrant a mayor or a magistrate not a lawyer cannot be expected to do more than to decide in a summary way that the indictment is intended to charge an offense against the laws of the United States, that the person before him is the person charged and that there is probable cause to believe him guilty, without the magistrate's being held to more than avoiding palpable injustice. He is not intended to hold a preliminary trial and if probable cause is shown on the government side, he is not to set it aside because on the other evidence he believes the defendant innocent. The rule that would apply to a mayor applies to a commissioner of the United States.
3
4
The relator testified before the Commissioner both in general terms and in detail that he and his company were innocent. The Commissioner excluded further details from him confirmatory of what he had sworn and evidence of customers that they were acquired in the way of competitive trade, seemingly on the ground that they would not or at least might not know that they were held as customers because of an agreement among the defendants, and also on the ground that he was not called on to listen to merely defensive proof: an opinion that he expressed. On a summary proceeding like this even if the exclusion was wrong it would not be enough to invalidate the order of removal, as the Commissioner indicated by his finding that he thought there were substantial grounds for the charge of guilt and that it was not for him to decide whether they were met by the denials of the defendant even if they seemed convincing. Collins v. Loisel, L. Ed. 
4
5
We do not regard the attack upon the indictment as needing discussion. It has been upheld by a number of District Courts and by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit as sufficient for removal purposes. It alleges that the Iowa Malleable Iron Company under the charge of the relator was party to an agreement to eliminate competition in interstate trade and to fix excessive and noncompetitive prices and that the company and the relator are engaged in a conspiracy in restraint of trade among the States. The relator is not left in doubt of the effort of the grand jury to present him as criminal under the Sherman Act.
5
6
It is pointed out in Beavers v. Henkel, L. Ed. that there are much stronger reasons for caution in surrendering an alleged criminal to a foreign nation than are required before removing a citizen from one place to another within the jurisdiction, yet in the latest case on extradition it is said that 'habeas corpus is available only to inquire whether the magistrate had jurisdiction, whether the offense charged is within the treaty and, by a somewhat liberal extension, whether there was any evidence warranting the finding that there was reasonable ground to believe the accused guilty.' Fernadez v. Phillips. So far as the attack upon the order of removal is by habeas corpus this would seem to apply. Price v. Henkel, L. Ed. 
6
7
But to recur to what we intimated at the beginning, the requirements of the statute, be they greater or less, are not requirements of the Constitution but only in aid of the Constitution, made, in rather a remote sense, 'in order that any one accused shall not be deprived of this constitutional right' to be tried in the District wherein the crime shall have been committed. A statement in Harlan v. McGourin, Ann. Cas. that Tinsley v. Treat held the exclusion of evidence to be a denial of a right secured under the Federal Constitution is inaccurate as we have shown. The relator's contention that he has been deprived of constitutional rights fails.
7
8
If follows that the order of the District Court must be affirmed.

9
Order affirmed.

Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND concurs in the result.

11
Mr. Justice BRANDEIS is of the opinion that, by refusing to hear and to consider evidence introduced or offered which bore upon the existence of probable cause, the commissioner did not merely commit error, but deprived the petitioner of his liberty without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment, because he was denied a fair hearing.

271 U.S. 170
BOWERS, Collector of Internal Revenue,
v.
KERBAUGH-EMPIRE CO.
Argued Jan. 25, 1926.
1
Defendant in error, a New York corporation, sued to recover $paid under protest on account of income taxes for Revenue Act et seq. (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. a et seq.).
1
2
It owned all the capital stock of H. S. Kerbaugh, Incorporated, engaged in the performance of large construction contracts, and applied to the Deutsche Bank of Germany, through its New York representative, for loans to finance the work being done by its subsidiary. The bank agreed that it would make the loans by cabling to the credit of its New York representative German marks equivalent in dollars to the requirements of defendant in error, upon condition that the loans would be evidenced by notes payable as to principal and interest in marks or their equivalent in United States gold coin at prime bankers' rate in New York for cable transfers to Berlin. June 8, 1911, defendant in error advised the New York representative of the amount in dollars then needed; he notified his principal and it put to his credit in a New York bank marks equivalent to the amount of money of the United States applied for. Then he drew his check payable in dollars against the credit and gave it to defendant in error, and in exchange received the promissory note of the latter payable in marks or their equivalent in gold coin of the United States. Prior to July 2, 1913, 24 loans were made in this manner, amounting in all to $ The equivalent in marks was September 1, 1913, there remained unpaid marks. The notes of defendant in error then outstanding were surrendered and its new note for that amount was given. And when that note became due it was renewed. Partial payments were made and, by March 31, 1915, the principal was reduced to marks.
2
3
The several amounts from time to time borrowed by defendant in error were contemporaneously advanced to its subsidiary and were expended and lost in and about the performance of the construction contracts. These losses were sustained in and were allowed as deductions in the subsidiary's income tax returns for those years. The excess of its losses over income was more than the amount here claimed by plaintiff in error to be income of defendant in error in 1921.
3
4
After the United States entered the War the Deutsche Bank was an alien enemy. In on the demand of the Alien Property Custodian, defendant in error paid him $in full settlement of principal and interest owing on the note belonging to the bank. Of that amount $represented principal. The settlement was on the basis of 2 1/2 cents per mark. Measured by United States gold coin the difference between the value of the marks borrowed at the time the loans were made and the amount paid to the Custodian was $ The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, notwithstanding the claim of defendant in error that the amount borrowed had been lost in construction operations carried on by it and its subsidiary, and that no income resulted from the transaction, held the amount to be income and chargeable to defendant in error for Excluding that item, the tax return for shows a deficit of $.
4
5
The defendant in error by its complaint set forth the facts above stated and asserted-as it still insists-that the diminution in value of the marks was not income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment, that the item in controversy is not within the Revenue Act, and that, if construed to include it, the act would be unconstitutional. Plaintiff in error moved to dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court denied the motion and gave judgment for defendant in error. Kerbaugh-Empire Co. v. Bowers (D. C.) This writ of error was taken under section Judicial Code (Comp. St. § , before the amendment of February .
5
6
The question for decision is whether the difference between the value of marks measured by dollars at the time of payment to the Custodian and the value when the loans were made was income.
6
7
The Sixteenth Amendment declares that Congress shall have power to levy and collect taxes on income, 'from whatever source derived' without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration. It was not the purpose or effect of that amendment to bring any new subject within the taxing power. Congress already had power to tax all incomes. But taxes on incomes from some sources had been held to be 'direct taxes' within the meaning of the constitutional requirement as to apportionment. Art. 1, § 2, cl. 3, § 9, cl. 4; Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., L. Ed. The Amendment relieved from that requirement and obliterated the distinction in that respect between taxes on income that are direct taxes and those that are not, and so put on the same basis all incomes 'from whatever source derived.' Brushaber v. Union Pac. R. R., L. Ed. Ann. Cas. 'Income' has been taken to mean the same thing as used in the Corporation Excise Tax Act of , in the Sixteenth Amendment, and in the various revenue acts subsequently passed. Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, L. Ed. Merchants' L. & T. Co. v. Smietanka, L. Ed. After full consideration, this court declared that income may be defined as gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined, including profit gained through sale or conversion of capital. Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, L. Ed. Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers Co., L. Ed. Eisner v. Macomber, L. Ed. And that definition has been adhered to and applied repeatedly. See, e. g., Merchants' L. & T. Co. v. Smietanka, supra; Goodrich v. Edwards, L. Ed. United States v. Phellis, Miles v. Safe Deposit Co., L. Ed. United States v. Supplee-Biddle Co., L. Ed. Irwin v. Gavit, L. Ed. Edwards v. Cuba Railroad, L. Ed. In determining what constitutes income substance rather than form is to be given controlling weight. Eisner v. Macomber, supra. The transaction here in question did not result in gain from capital and labor, or from either of them, or in profit gained through the sale or conversion of capital. The essential facts set forth in the complaint are the loans in the loss in of the moneys borrowed, the excess of such losses over income by more than the item here in controversy, and payment in the equivalent of marks greatly depreciated in value. The result of the whole transaction was a loss.
7
8
Plaintiff in error insists that in substance and effect the transaction was a 'short sale' of marks resulting in gain to defendant in error. But there is no similarity between what was done and such a venture. A short seller borrows what he sells, and the purchase price goes to the lender and is retained as security for repayment. The seller receives nothing until he repays the loan. Such a transaction would not meet the requirements of defendant in error. It needed the money for use and received the amount borrowed and expended it.
8
9
The contention that the item in question is cash gain disregards the fact that the borrowed money was lost, and that the excess of such loss over income was more than the amount borrowed. When the loans were made and notes given, the assets and liabilities of defendant in error were increased alike. The loss of the money borrowed wiped out the increase of assets, but the liability remained. The assets were further diminished by payment of the debt. The loss was less than it would have been if marks had not declined in value; but the mere diminution of loss is not gain, profit, or income.

Judgment affirmed.

R. H. HASSLER, Inc.,
v.
SHAW.
Argued April 27, 1926.
1
This is a writ of error upon a judgment in personam against the plaintiff in error on the ground that there never was any valid service of process against it and that therefore there was no jurisdiction in the Court. The writ was transferred from the Circuit Court of Appeals to this Court, the case being one in which the jurisdiction of the District Court and that alone was in issue within the meaning of section of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. § , under the decisions in Shepard v. Adams, L. Ed. Remington v. Central Pacific R. R. Co., L. Ed. and Board of Trade v. Hammond Elevator Co., L. Ed. and therefore not open to review in the Circuit Court of Appeals. The Carlo Poma, L. Ed. 
1
2
The suit is for an alleged breach of contract and was brought in a Court of the State of South Carolina against a corporation of Indiana. The only personal service was by delivery of copies of the summons and complaint in Indiana, on May 12, 1919, as the record shows. An attachment was levied on property alleged to belong to the defendant and within the State. The record further shows that in the same month the defendant moved to set aside the service, and that the motion was refused, without prejudice to the defendant's right to set up the special defense in its answer, this being a right clearly given by the statutes of South Carolina. The case then was removed to the District Court of the United States and subsequently in September of the same year an answer was filed alleging the above-mentioned motion and order, and setting up that the Court had no jurisdiction, because the defendant was an indiana corporation doing no business and having no property within the State upon which attachment could be levied so as to give the Court jurisdiction, and also, reserving its right to object to the jurisdiction, pleading to the merits. In March, 1921, an amended complaint was filed alleging that the defendant had property in the State and setting forth the cause of action. The defendant answered denying the jurisdiction as before and denying that it had property within the State, and saving its right to object to the jurisdiction, again answering to the merits. With regard to the attachment it is enough to say that a third party intervened, claimed the goods and finally got judgment for them. But before that happened there was a trial on the merits between the plaintiff and defendant and a verdict for the plaintiff in 1921. The motion for judgment was delayed until May 1924. In the same month the defendant moved to set aside the verdict and to dismiss the complaint for want of jurisdiction. The judge then sitting thought that the question of jurisdiction should be left to the decision of the Appellate Court and ordered judgment. A motion to vacate the judgment was overruled on the same ground.
2
3
Thus it is manifest that the record shows a judgment against a defendant never served with process and without any attachment of property-a judgment void upon its face unless the record discloses that the defendant came in and submitted to the jurisdiction, although not served. The record discloses no general appearance in terms, but on the contrary a continuous insistence by the defendant that it had not been brought within the power of the Court. But acts and omissions are relied upon as having the effect of a general appearance. First in order of time it is said that the petition to remove had that effect. This if true would be unjust, but the contrary is established. General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Ry. Co., L. Ed. Wabash Western Ry. Co. v. Brow, L. Ed. Then it is said that pleading to the merits was an appearance, notwithstanding the effort of the defendant to subordinate its denial of the cause of action to its protest against the jurisdiction and notwithstanding the statute of South Carolina, and the order in the cast purporting to save its rights. This again would be unjust but such is not the law. Harkness v. Hyde, Southern Pacific Co. v. Denton, It is said that going to trial on the merits without saving an exception submitted to the jurisdiction. The plaintiff (the defendant in error) objects to out seeking any explanation in a bill of exceptions that he says was allowed too late, but the record shows that at the time of the trial the attachment was outstanding, not having been vacated until later, and that it no doubt may have been, as the bill of exceptions shows that it was, the expectation of the trial judge that the verdict would be satisfied out of the attached goods. The record showed the defendant's denial of the right to proceed, and the grounds for it. It was not necessary to reiterate the denial in a bill of exceptions, in order to get it on the record. It already was there.
3
4
There was some suggestion that the emphasis, at least, of the answer denying jurisdiction was on the absence of the defendant from the State and its having no property there. But the answer and the amended answer elaborately set out the motion to set aside the service and the reservation of the defendant's rights by the State judge. It seems to us impossible to doubt that this was meant to save the question and that it would be hypertechnical to require a more explicit statement that the grounds of the motion as well as the other matters mentioned were still the basis on which jurisdiction was denied. The other matters were added simply to give further force to the failure to serve within the State. We are of opinion that the record does not disclose an appearance by the defendant, or any submission to the jurisdiction that it sought and had a right to avoid.

UNITED STATES
v.
NOVECK.
Argued Jan. 25, 1926.
1
Defendant in error was indicted November 5, 1923. The first count alleges the commission of perjury on March 13, 1920-more than three years before indictment. The District Court quashed that count on the ground that the prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations. The case is here under the Criminal Appeals Act of (Comp. St. § .
1
2
The count charges 'the crime of perjury as defined by section of the United States Criminal Code.' That section provides:
2
3
'Whoever, having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true, shall willfully and contrary to such oath state or subscribe any material matter which he does not believe to be true, is guilty of perjury. * * *' (Comp. St. § .
3
4
The substance of the charge is that defendant in error on oath stated that the income tax due from S. Noveck & Co., Inc., for on an income of $ whereas in fact the tax due was $on an income of $ And it is alleged that the perjury was committed 'for the purpose of defrauding the United States.'
4
Section 1044 of the Revised Statutes, as amended by the Act of November (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. , provides:
5
6
'No person shall be prosecuted, * * * for any offense, not capital, except as provided in section unless the indictment is found, * * * within three years next after such offense shall have been committed: Provided, however, that in offenses involving the defrauding or attempts to defraud the United States * * * the period of limitation shall be six years.'
6
7
The amendatory act added the proviso. Section Revised Statutes (Comp. St. § , declares that no person shall be prosecuted for any crime arising under the revenue laws unless the indictment is found within five years after the committing of such crime. Act July as amended by Revenue Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. , fixes a three-year period of limitation for offenses arising under the internal revenue laws of the United States. Section of the Criminal Code, under which the indictment was found, is not a part of and does not refer to the revenue laws. The limitations fixed in respect of offenses arising under those laws do not apply. See United States v. Hirsch, United States v. Rabinowich, L. Ed. 
7
8
Plaintiff in error contends that, as the perjury in this case is charged to have been committed in the making of an income tax return, and is specially alleged to have been committed for the purpose of defrauding the United States, the offense is brought within the proviso to section and that the six-year period of limitation applies. But the alleged purpose to defraud the United States is not an element of the crime defined in section on which the indictment is based. That allegation does not affect the charge; it need not be proved and may be rejected as mere surplusage. In re Lane, L. Ed. The construction of sections contended for by the government divides perjury into two classes. It makes one include offenses having the elements specified in section and the other to include those containing the further element of purpose to defraud the United States. And that would apply similarly to every offense to which the three-year period fixed by section was applicable before the proviso was added. The effect is to create offenses separate and distinct from those defined by specific enactments. Obviously that was not intended. The Act of November 17, 1921, merely added a proviso to a statute of limitations. Statutes will not be read to create crimes, or new degrees or classes of crime, unless the purpose so to do is plain. The language in question does not require the construction contended for. Indeed it is not all appropriate for the making of such classifications or the creation of offenses. Its purpose is to apply the six-year period to every case in which defrauding or an attempt to defraud the United States is an ingredient under the statute defining the offense. There are several such offenses. Section affords an illustration. But perjury as defined by section does not contain any such element.

BOOTH FISHERIES CO. et al.
v.
INDUSTRIAL COMMISSION OF WISCONSIN et al.
Argued May 5, 1926.
1
This was a suit begun in the circuit court of Dane County, Wis., to review and set aside findings and award under the Wisconsin Workmen's Compensation Act of a death benefit in favor of Mary McLaughlin, as widow of William McLaughlin, against his employer, the Booth Fisheries Company, and that company's surety, the Zurich General Accident & Liability Company.
1
2
The petition avers that the Industrial Commission, in making the award, acted without and in excess of its powers in finding that the personal injuries and death of William McLaughlin were proximately caused by accident, and not intentionally self-inflicted, and that this finding was contrary to the evidence and contrary to the law. The circuit court and the Supreme Court of the state held that the findings of fact by the commission were supported by evidence, and so were conclusive.
2
3
The only question raised on the appeal to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin was the constitutionality under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Workmen's Compensation Act of Wisconsin in its limitation of the judicial review of the findings of fact of the Industrial Commission to cases in which 'the findings of fact by the commission do not support the order or award.' Wisconsin Statutes This limitation has been held by the state Supreme Court to mean that the findings of fact made by the Industrial Commission are conclusive, if there is any evidence to support them. Northwestern Iron Co. v. Industrial Commission, L. R. A. Ann. Cas. Milwaukee v. Industrial Commission, Milwaukee C. & G. Co. v. Industrial Commission, William Rahr Sons Co. v. Industrial Commission, Booth Fisheries Co. v. Industrial Commission, It follows that the court may not in its review weigh the evidence or set aside the finding on the ground that it is against the preponderance of the testimony.
3
4
It is argued that the employer in a suit for compensation under the act is entitled under the Fourteenth Amendment to his day in court, and that he does not secure it unless he may submit to a court the question of the preponderance of the evidence on the issues raised
4
5
A complete answer to this claim is found in the elective or voluntary character of the Wisconsin Compensation Act. That act provides that every employer who has elected to do so shall become subject to the act, that such election shall be made by filing a written statement with the commission, which shall subject him to the terms of the law for a year until July 1st following and to successive terms of one year unless he withdraws. Wisconsin Stat. §§ It is conceded by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error that the act is elective, and that it is so is shown by the decisions of the Wisconsin court in Borgnis v. Falk Co., L. R. A. (N. S.) and in the present case. If the employer elects not to accept the provisions of the Compensation Act, he is not bound to respond in a proceeding before the Industrial Commission under the act, but may await a suit for damages for injuries or wrongful death by the person claiming recovery therefor, and make his defense at law before a court in which the issues of fact and law are to be tried by jury. In view of such an opportunity for choice, the employer who elects to accept the law may not complain that in the plan for assessing the employer's compensation for injury sustained, there is no particular form of judicial review. This is clearly settled by the decision of this court in Hawkins v. Bleakly, L. Ed. 
5
6
More than this, the employer in this case having elected to accept the provisions of the law, and such benefits and immunities as it gives, may not escape its burdens by asserting that it is unconstitutional. The election is a waiver and estops such complaint. Daniels v. Tearney, Grand Rapids & I. R. Co. v. Osborn, L. Ed. 
6
7
The counsel for the plaintiff in error relies chiefly on the case of Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, L. Ed. That case does not apply. An order of a public service commission in fixing maximum rates for a water company was there attacked on the ground that the rates fixed were confiscatory. It was held that the law creating the commission, which had operated to withhold opportunity for appeal to the courts to determine the question, as a matter of fact and law, whether the rates were confiscatory, could not be sustained, and was in conflict with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. But in that case, the water company was denied opportunity to resort to a court to test the question of the confiscatory character of its rates and of its right to earn an adequate income. Here the employer was given an election to defend against a full court proceeding but accepted the alternative of the Compensation Act.

The judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin is affirmed.

CHESAPEAKE & O. RY. CO.
v.
NIXON.
Argued May 3, 1926.
1
This is a suit to recover damages for the death of the plaintiff's husband, the interstate, from the Railroad Company upon whose tracks the death occurred. The plaintiff (the respondent here) obtained a verdict and judgment in the trial Court and upon a writ of error the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia. As the recovery was based upon the Employers' Liability Act of April (Comp. St. § , the death having occurred in interstate commerce, a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court to review certain questions of law that arose in the case. L. Ed. 
1
2
The deceased was an experienced section foreman upon the defendant's road. One of his duties was to go over and examine the track and to keep it in proper repair. When inspecting the track he used a three wheeled velocipede that fitted the rails and was propelled by the feet of the user. He had obtained from his immediate superior, the Supervisor of Track, leave to use the machine also in going to his work from his house, about a mile distant, over a part of the track that was in his charge. His work began at 7 in the morning and at half past 6 on the day of his death he started as usual. Five minutes later he was overtaken by a train and killed. For reasons that the jury found insufficient to excuse the omission the engineer and fireman of the train were not on the lookout, and the question raised is whether as toward the deceased the defendant owed a duty to keep a lookout, or whether on the other hand the deceased took the risk.
2
3
If the accident had happened an hour later when the deceased was inspecting the track, we think that there is no doubt that he would be held to have assumed the risk, and to have understood, as he instructed his men, that he must rely upon his own watchfulness and keep out of the way. The Railroad Company was entitled to expect that self-protection from its employees. Aerkfetz v. Humphreys, L. Ed. Boldt v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., L. Ed. Connelley v. Pennsylvania R. Co., L. R. A. (N. S.) Davis v. Philadelphia & R. Ry. Co. (D. C.) Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Wachter, Elliott on Railroads ( The duty of the railroad company toward this class of employees was not affected by that which it might owe to others.
3
4
The permission to use the velocipede in going to his work did not make the defendant's obligation to the deceased greater than it would have been after he got there. We assume that it was as effective to make the use of the car lawful as would have been a stockholder's vote spread upon the records of the company. But the implications are not necessarily the same. It was a trifling incident of daily life by which a subordinate officer of the company allowed one lower in grade to enlarge his customary use of the machine by an hour for his own convenience, although even then, in the opinion of the Court of Appeals of Virginia, already engaged in his duties. It seems to us to have been no more than an extension of his ordinary rights and his usual risks.

VIRGINIAN RY. CO.
v.
MULLENS.
Argued Jan. 21, 22, 1926.
1
This was an action in a state court in West Virginia to recover for injuries to the plaintiff's land resulting from a nuisance alleged to have been created and maintained by the defendant. The action was begun June 14, 1921. The case stated in the complaint was to the effect that the defendant constructed in 1904, and operated up to the time of suit, a railroad through West Virginia, a short section of which was located on a right of way acquired for the purpose and extending laterally into a natural stream bounding the plaintiff's land; that this section was constructed by filling in and building up the outer part of the bed of the stream opposite his land and placing the track on the embankment so made; that the embankment and track narrowed the former channel, crowded the current against the bank on the plaintiff's side and exposed his land to overflow and injury; and that on divers occasions thereafter, particularly in the years this obstruction caused the waters to wash away portions of the bank and to overflow and injure his land.
1
2
The defendant interposed a plea putting in issue the allegations in the complaint, and by a further plea insisted that the road was under federal control from December 28, 1917, to March 1, 1920, and that no liability attached to the defendant for such of the injuries as occurred during that control.
2
3
The trial resulted in a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, and the Supreme Court of Appeals of the state, although petitioned by the defendant to review the judgment, declined so to do, thus making the trial court the highest court of the state in which a decision could be had. American Ry. Express Co. v. Levee, The case is here on writ of certiorari, and the question presented is whether there was error in holding the defendant liable for injuries done during federal control.
3
4
The case shown by the evidence differed from that stated in the complaint. Affirmatively and without dispute the proofs disclosed that the railroad was not constructed by the defendant, but by another railway company, and was purchased by the defendant in 1907, after it was completed and in full operation; that after the purchase the defendant used the embankment and track in the bed of the stream as an integral part of the road, just as it was used before; that the plaintiff, although familiar with the situation, made no complaint of this use or of the presence of the embankment and track in that place; that on December 28, 1917, the United States took possession of the railroad and its appurtenances, and from that time to March 1, 1920, operated and controlled the same to the exclusion of the defendant; that during such operation and control the United States exercised the usual rights of an owner by altering parts of the roadbed, widening tunnels, laying double tracks along parts of the road and using the property as best suited the government's purposes. As respects the section in the bed of the stream the evidence showed that the United States made no change therein, but continued the use theretofore made of it as part of the road; and as respects the injuries done to the plaintiff's land the evidence, taken most favorably to him, disclosed that, while there was some cutting of the bank on his side soon after the road was constructed and also during the defendant's possession and operation, the chief injuries occurred in February, 1918, and July, 1919, during federal control, when in the course of two unusual freshets portions of the bank were washed away and his land was overflowed and materially injured.
4
5
At the conclusion of the evidence the defendant, relying on acts of Congress and proclamations of the President bearing on the federal control, requested the court to charge the jury that the defendant was not liable for the injuries occurring during such control and that as to them the finding and verdict must be for the defendant. But the request was refused and the defendant excepted. If the request was well grounded in law, its refusal was plainly prejudicial.
5
6
While the evidence may have admitted of a finding that the embankment and track in the bed of the stream tended to obstruct and divert the current in such way as to constitute a nuisance, it affirmatively and indubitably precluded a finding that the defendant constructed them or did more than use them as an integral part of a completed road which it had purchased as a going concern from a prior owner. Thus there was no basis no which the defendant could be charged with liability as the creator of the nuisance. If liable at all, it was liable only because it continued the use to which the embankment and track were put by its grantor. There has been much contrariety of decision in the courts of the several states as to whether a purchaser who merely continues a prior use of such a structure may be charged, at the instance of one who has made no complaint or objection, with liability for maintaining a nuisance. The question ordinarily is one of local law to be resolved according to local decisions, and out of deference to the action of the court below we assume that in West Virginia a complaint or objection is not deemed essential, although no decision on the point by the Supreme Court of Appeals has been brought to our attention. But here it was insisted and the proofs conclusively established that the defendant's use ceased when federal control began, and that the chief injuries occurred during the period of that control. The questions of the defendant's legal relation to the road and the operation thereof while under federal control and of its liability for injuries occurring during that period involved a consideration of the nature of that control and of the operation and effect of federal statutes and proclamations bearing on the subject. In short, they are federal questions.

By the Act of August Congress empowered the President, in time of war, to take possession and assume control of transportation systems and to utilize the same in the transportation of troops, war material and equipment, and for other needful or desirable purposes incident to such an emergency. War with Germany was declared April 6, 1917, and with Austria-Hungary December 7, 1917, and in both instances Congress pledged all of the resources of the country to bring the conflict to a successful termination. Under a proclamation declaring his purpose so to do ((Comp. St. Comp. St. Ann. Supp. )), the President took possession and assumed control, at noon on December 28, 1917, of various systems of transportation, including the defendant's railroad and the appurtenances thereof, to the end that they might be operated and utilized in transporting troops, war material and equipment, and in performing other service in the national interest; and he committed the possession, control, operation and utilization of such systems to a Director General designated by him for the purpose. By the Act of March (Comp. St. Comp. St. Ann. Supp. a et seq.), Congress confirmed the President's action in thus taking over the transportation systems, made provision for continuing such federal control under the President's direction, and empowered him to exercise his authority in that regard through agencies of his selection. In General Order No. 50, issued October 28, 1918 (U. S. R. R. Administration Bulletin No. , which recited that suits were being brought against railroad companies, the roads of which were under federal control, on causes of action arising during such control for which the companies were not responsible, it was directed that actions and suits based on claims for injuries to persons, damage to property, etc., growing out of the possession, use, control or operation of any railroad by the Director General be brought against that officer, and not otherwise.
7
8
We heretofore have considered the legislation, proclamation and order just recited and have held that they provided for a complete possession by the United States and contemplated a single and effective control by federal authority to the exclusion of the private owners (Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. North Dakota, L. Ed. ; and that during federal control 'no liability arising out of the operation of these systems was imposed by the common law upon the owner companies as their interest in and control over the systems were completely suspended' (Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. Ault, L. Ed. ). In the latter case the contention was made that the act of should be construed as subjecting the companies to liability for acts or omissions of the agency exercising federal control, notwithstanding they were deprived of all power over the properties, because the just compensation to be paid to them would include any loss resulting to them from such liability. But this court disposed of the contention by saying (:
8
9
'Such a radical departure from the established concepts of legal liability would at least approach the verge of constitutional power.
9
10
It should not be made in the absence of compelling language. * * * There is none such here.'
10
11
And, turning to a provision in the act of declaring 'carriers while under federal control' liable and suable, the court said (:
11
12
'Here the term 'carriers' was used as it is understood in common speech; meaning the transportation systems as distinguished from the corporations owning or operating them.'
12
13
'This means, as a matter of law, that the government or its agency for operation could be sued, for under the existing law the legal person in control of the carrier was responsible for its acts. * * * All doubt as to how suit should be brought was cleared away by General Order No. 50, which required that it be against the Director General by name.'
13
14
In Wabash Ry. Co. v. Elliott, L. Ed. the decision was to the same effect. In North Carolina R. R. Co. v. Lee, L. Ed. it was held that the government operated the railroads during federal control 'not as lessee, but under a right in the nature of eminent domain'; and in Dupont de Nemours & Co. v. Davis, it was added that:
14
15
'In taking over and operating the railroad systems of the country the United States did so in its sovereign capacity, as a war measure.'
15
16
In principle these decisions are determinative of the question here presented. They show that federal control did not rest on a conventional arrangement with the owner companies, but on an exertion of supreme governmental power, and that the legislation, proclamation and order before recited contemplated a complete separation of the companies from the roads while under such control, and an absence of responsibility by the companies for losses and injuries resulting from the use, operation, and maintenance of the roads during that period.
16
17
When the United States took over this road the embankment and track in the bed of the stream were taken over as part of it, and the defendant was deprived of all power over them while they remained under federal control. Their maintenance and use during that period were exclusively in the hands of federal agents. If a duty rested on any one to make any change in them, it rested on the federal agents; and if maintaining and using them without change was a wrong against the plaintiff, it was a wrong committed by those agents, for which no liability attached to the defendant.
17
18
The plaintiff relies on cases holding the creator of a nuisance liable for injuries resulting therefrom after he had transferred the premises to another by need or lease; but they are not in point. They proceed on the theory that by such a transfer the creator expressly or impliedly affirms the right of the transferee to continue the prior situation or use, and also voluntarily disables himself from correcting or abating the same. Here the defendant had neither created the nuisance nor made a voluntary transfer of the premises. The United States, as we have seen, came into possession, not as a conventional transferee, but by an exercise of governmental power in which the defendant had no voice.
18
19
The plaintiff also seeks to support the judgment on the theory that the defendant company was under a contract obligation to protect his land from injury, and to make out that obligation he refers to a clause in the deed whereby the defendant's grantor acquired the right of way and to a clause in the deed whereby the defendant afterwards acquired the completed road. But he is not in a position to urge this contention here. The case stated in the complaint was distinctly in tort. There was no mention of a contract obligation; nor any reference to either of the two deeds. And when the court came to charge the jury the plaintiff tendered and the court included in its charge various instructions wherein the case was treated, in keeping with the complaint, as one to recover damages for an alleged tortious creation and continuance of a nuisance. After bringing and trying the case on that theory the plaintiff cannot be permitted on this review to change to another which the defendant was not required to meet below. Other objections to the contract theory are suggested buy they need not be considered.
19
20
We conclude that the court should have instructed the jury, as it was requested to do, that the defendant was not liable for the injuries occurring during federal control.
20
21
Judgment reversed.

SPERRY GYROSCOPE CO.
v.
ARMA ENGINEERING CO.
Argued April 15, 1926.

Mr. Justice Mc,REYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.
4
5
Appellant brought suit against the Engineering Company, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, for damages, profits, etc., on account of the manufacture by it of gyroscopic compasses, covered by patents, for the United States; also for an injunction against further infringements. The allegation which demands special consideration follows:
5
6
'That the defendant, well knowing the premises, but with intent to injure the plaintiff, to interfere with its business, and to deprive it of the profits derived and to be derived from making, using, and selling said inventions, has, within the Eastern District of New York, and without the license or consent of plaintiff, but against its positive protest, made a number of gyroscopic compasses for and sold them to the United States Navy Department under contract with the said Navy Department, subsequent to the dates of said patents and within six years next preceding the filing of this complaint, to wit, during the years all in infringement of the aforesaid letters patent, and that defendant is preparing and threatening to infringe said patents more extensively by the manufacture of said infringing apparatus for and its sale to the United States Navy Department under contract with the said Department and thus to inflict further injury, damage, and loss upon the plaintiff; but to what extent the defendant has profited by reason of the aforesaid infringement plaintiff is ignorant and cannot set forth, and prays an account thereof.'
6
7
The contract with the United States is not set forth. Whether it undertook to protect them against claims arising under appellant's patents, or whether the compasses were delivered before or after July 1, 1918, or whether the arrangement necessarily involved an infringement of the patents, does not appear.
7
8
The trial court dismissed the bill for lack of jurisdiction, and granted this direct appeal December 30, 1924. Such appeals were permitted by section Judicial Code (Comp. St. § , 'in any case in which the jurisdiction of the court is in issue, in which case the question of jurisdiction alone shall be certified to the Supreme Court from the court below for decision.' We are now concerned only with the power of the trial court to decide the controversy revealed by the record.
8
9
Under section 24, Judicial Code (Comp. St. § , District Courts have original jurisdiction:
9
10
'Seventh. Of all suits at law or in equity arising under the patent, the copyright, and the trade-mark laws.'
10
11
Appellant charged that the Engineering Company had infringed its patents by making and selling compasses to the United States, under contract, during the years and intended further to infringe by continuing so to do. It asked for damages and an injunction. But for the allegation that the inventions were made and sold under such a contract, this would be but the ordinary patent suit. And so the real question presented is whether that allegation was enough to deprive the District Court of the jurisdiction plainly conferred by section 24.
11
12
Act of June (Comp. St. § , 'to provide additional protection for owners of patents,' directed:
12
13
'That whenever an invention described in and covered by a patent of the United States shall hereafter be used by the United States without license of the owner thereof or lawful right to use the same, such owner may recover reasonable compensation for such use by suit in the Court of Claims.'
13
14
The Act of July (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. , amended the act of to read:
14
15
'That whenever an invention described in and covered by a patent of the United States shall hereafter be used or manufactured by or for the United States without license of the owner thereof or lawful right to use or manufacture the same, such owner's remedy shall be by suit against the United States in the Court of Claims for the recovery of his reasonable and entire compensation for such use and manufacture: Provided, however, that said Court of Claims shall not entertain a suit or award compensation under the provisions of this act where the claim for compensation is based on the use or manufacture by or for the United States of any article heretofore owned, leased, used by, or in the possession of the United States: Provided further, that in any such suit the United States may avail itself of any and all defenses, general or special, that might be pleaded by a defendant in an action for infringement, as set forth in title sixty of the Revised Statutes, or otherwise: And provided further, that the benefits of this act shall not inure to any patentee who, when he makes such claim, is in the employment or service of the government of the United States, or the assignee of any such patentee; nor shall this act apply to any device discovered or invented by such employee during the time of his employment or service.'
15
16
The argument is that the act of deprived the District Court of jurisdiction over the controversy between the present parties, because it limited the patent owner's remedy, under circumstances like those here disclosed, to a suit against the United States in the Court of Claims. But we think this contention goes to the merits of the matter, and not merely to the question of jurisdiction. The true intent and meaning of the statute is not free from doubt; but certainly there is nothing therein which shows any clear purpose to take away the power to decide. It became the duty of the court below to consider and determine whether, in the circumstances stated, appellee was relieved of liability and permitted by the statute to do what otherwise would have constituted a violation of appellant's rights. There was jurisdiction. The judgment below must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. See The Pesaro, L. Ed. Smith v. Apple, L. Ed. Smyth v. Asphalt Belt Ry., L. Ed.

This appeal is without merit, and the interlocutory decree below must be affirmed.

By an Act approved August 20, 1906, the Legislature of Georgia declared unlawful certain agreements for the purchase or sale, for future delivery, of designated commodities, and made participation therein a misdemeanor. It also prohibited maintenance of an office where such agreements are offered, and specified what should constitute prima facie evidence of guilty connection therewith. Laws .

Subsequent to the passage of the act of appellants, citizens of states other than Georgia, established in Fulton county a branch office, with the ordinary quotation board, where they solicited and received orders, accompanied by margins, to purchase or sell cotton for future delivery on the New York and New Orleans Exchanges. They were threatened with arrest and prosecution for violating the act of By a bill in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia they challenged the validity of that statute upon the ground that it interfered with the free flow of commerce merce between the states. They alleged that the threatened action would deprive them of rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution, and asked that appellees be enjoined from proceeding therewith.

5
The District Court, three judges sitting, having heard the matter, concluded that the statute condemned gambling transactions only, did not affect interstate commerce, and that the proposed proceedings against appellants would not deprive them of any right. The request for preliminary injunction was accordingly refused, and this appeal followed.

The trial court discovered no necessity for the relief asked. The record discloses no adequate reason for a different conclusion here. There was no abuse of discretion.

Ex parte Young, L. Ed. Ann. Cas. and following cases have established the doctrine that, when absolutely necessary for protection of constitutional rights, courts of the United States have power to enjoin state officers from instituting criminal actions. But this may not be done, except under extraordinary circumstances, where the danger of irreparable loss is both great and immediate. Ordinarily, there should be no interference with such officers; primarily, they are charged with the duty of prosecuting offenders against the laws of the state, and must decide when and how this is to be done. The accused should first set up and rely upon his defense in the state courts, even though this involves a challenge of the validity of some statute, unless it plainly appears that this course would not afford adequate protection. The Judicial Code provides ample opportunity for ultimate review here in respect of federal questions. An intolerable condition would arise, if, whenever about to be charged with violating a state law, one were permitted freely to contest its validity by an original proceeding in some federal court.

HENKELS
v.
SUTHERLAND, Alien Property Custodian, et al.
Argued May 5, 6, 1926.
1
This is a suit in equity, under section 9(a) of the Trading with the Enemy Act, c. as amended by c. Stat. (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. e), brought by Henkels, a citizen of the United States, in the federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, to recover the proceeds of the sale of shares of common stock of International Textile, Inc., a Connecticut corporation, theretofore seized by the Alien Property Custodian upon the claim that it was the property of an alien enemy. A decree was rendered in Henkels' favor, adjudging him to be the sole owner of the stock, and the Treasurer of the United States was directed to account for, and pay over to Henkels, the proceeds of the sale 'together with the income or interest, if any, earned thereon.' There was realized from the sale of the stock, made on March 26, 1919, after deducting expenses, a balance of $ This amount the Treasurer paid to Henkels. Subsequently Henkels applied to the District Court to name a master to take and state the account of interest or income earned upon the fund prior to its payment. The application was denied and a final decree of dismissal entered upon the ground that the principal sum had been paid in Henkels, who had executed a release and satisfaction in full which the court refused to set aside on the claim of duress. Henkels v. Miller, Upon appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals, without passing upon this ground, held that the United States was not liable for income resulting from an investment of the funds in its own securities. Henkels v. Miller. 
1
2
The proceeds arising from the sale of the stock were deposited with the Treasurer in conformity with law, and by that officer they were commingled with the proceeds of other sales of alien property and invested in interest-bearing securities of the United States. The government admits Henkels' right to recover income earned on the corporate shares prior to their sale, but denies his right to recover for interest actually paid on government securities in which the proceeds had been invested. This presents the only question for our determination, the government having expressly waived the point upon which the District Court decided the case.
2
3
No question is made in respect of the right of the Custodian to seize property supposed to belong to an enemy, although it may subsequently turn out to have been a mistake, adequate provision having been made for a return in that case. Central Trust Co. v. Garvan, L. Ed. Stoehr v. Wallace, L. Ed. 
3
4
By Executive Order No. of February 26, 1918, made pursuant to law, moneys deposited with the Treasurer by the Custodian are to be held by the Secretary of the Treasury 'for account of the Alien Property Custodian,' and may be invested and reinvested from time to time in bonds or United States certificates of indebtedness. All moneys so deposited, together with interest or income received from the investment thereof, are made subject to withdrawal by the Secretary of the Treasury for the purpose of making payments pursuant to the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act, which would include, of course, payments under section 9(a).
4
5
Section 9(a) authorizes a suit in equity by any person not an enemy, etc., to determine a claim to any interest, right or title in the property seized. If, in the meantime, the seized property has been sold, the same remedy, by section 7(c), as amended, c. (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. d), becomes available 'against the net proceeds received therefrom and held by the Alien Property Custodian or by the Treasurer of the United States.' No distinction in this respect is made between the property and its proceeds. It cannot be doubted that, if the seized property had been securities of the United States and these, thereafter, had been held in their original form, maturing coupons for interest would have belonged to the American claimant equally with the body of the bonds. In principle, there can be no difference between such a case and the one here, where claimant's property had been converted into securities of the United States. Such securities constitute the statutory 'net proceeds,' and, by the clear import of the statute, claimant's rights in respect of such proceeds are not inferior to his rights in respect of the original property. And no distinction fairly can be made between the accumulated interest upon securities constituting the proceeds, in the one case, and like securities constituting the property, in the other.
5
6
The government cannot be sued without its consent, and accordingly it cannot be sued for interest unless it consents to be liable therefor. But the claim here is not for interest to be paid by the United States in the sense of the rule. It is for income, derived from an investment of Henkels' money in obligations of the United States, which income has been actually received by the Treasury and is in its possession, to be held, as the proceeds themselves are to be held, for the account of the Alien Property Custodian.
6
7
With enemy-owned property seized by the Custodian, it has been held, the United States may deal as it sees fit, White v. Mechanics' Securities Corporation, L. Ed. (decided December 14, 1925); but it has no such latitude in respect of the property of an American citizen. Whether the government shall pay interest upon its obligations depends upon congressional assent; but it cannot confiscate the actual increment of property belonging to a citizen, or the increment of the proceeds into which such property has been converted, any more than it can confiscate the property or its proceeds, without coming into conflict with the Constitution.
7
8
The government contends that Angarica v. Bayard, is to the contrary, and the court below so held. In that case, the suit was for interest or income realized upon the amount of an award in favor of Angarica paid by the Spanish government to the United States. This court, in denying the right of recovery, applied the general rule of immunity from interest, saying (pages ) that the claim 'is not different in character from what it would have been if, instead of being a claim for increment or income actually received by the United States, it were a claim for interest generally, or for increment or income which the United States would or might have received by the exercise of proper care in the investment of the money.' Without challenging the correctness of this view as applied to the precise facts of that case, it cannot be accepted as a rule of general application. Especially, it cannot be accepted as applicable here, where the property of a citizen has been mistakenly seized, and, by executive authority, after conversion into money, has been invested in government securities. We cannot bring ourselves to agree that a direction to invest such money in securities of the United States, rather than in other securities, may be utilized to enable the government unjustly to enrich itself at the expense of its citizens, by appropriating income actually earned and received, which morally and equitably belongs to them as plainly as though they had themselves made the investment.
8
9
Since the proceeds resulting from the sale of Henkels' property have been commingled with the proceeds of other sales and thus invested, an account must be taken to ascertain the average rate of interest received by the Treasury upon all the proceeds invested and thereupon, after deducting proper charges and expenses and taking into consideration the average amount of such proceeds which remained uninvested in the Treasury, a proportionate allocation made in respect of the proceeds belonging to Henkels for the period of their investment.

MISSOURI, K. & T. RY. CO. et al.
v.
STATE OF OKLAHOMA et al.
Submitted March 5, 1926.
1
The railroad of plaintiff in error runs through the city of McAlester, Okl. At Comanche avenue the main line is on a fill, and at least one industrial or side track is on a lower level. In September, 1921, the city applied to the state Corporation Commission for an order requiring the railway company to provide at that place a pass under its tracks and a highway across its right of way. The commission ordered that the company prepare a plan and an estimate of quantities and cost for a reinforced concrete subway, having two openings of specified dimensions; that the plan show the location of industrial tracks, and that these tracks conform to the street grade; that the plan and estimate be filed with the mayor of the city and the Corporation Commission; and that, if the company and the city failed to agree on an apportionment of cost of the underpass, the commission would hear evidence on that subject. The company was ordered to have the underpass constructed and open for traffic within 90 days after arrangement by the city to pay its portion of the cost. The company filed its petition in the Supreme Court to have the order set aside on the grounds, among others, that it is repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and impairs the obligation of a contract, in violation of section 10 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States. The court affirmed the order (, and the case is here on writ of error. Section Judicial Code (Comp. St. § .
1
2
The line was built about on land granted by Congress to the company-then known as the Union Pacific Railroad Company, southern branch-for the construction of its railroad. Act July The city of South McAlester and the town site of McAlester were laid out subsequently, pursuant to the Act of Congress of June In platting these town sites, streets were laid out to the boundary line on each side of the land constituting the company's right of way. November 8, 1901, the city passed Ordinance No. 74. At that time there were a number of unauthorized crossings in use by the public, but the city had not acquired by purchase or condemnation the right of way for the extension of any street across the railroad. The ordinance was accepted by the company and is in form a contract. It provided for the immediate extension of certain platted streets across the right of way, tracks, and station grounds of the company in lieu of the unauthorized crossings then in use. Some of the new crossings were to be constructed by the company at its own expense, and the cost of others was to be borne equally by the parties. Terms and conditions for the construction of other crossings were set forth in the ordinance. It was declared that thereafter the city would open no other street across the right of way and tracks of the company, except upon payment of amounts specified in the ordinance as stipulated damages for a right of way across the railroad, any determination in condemnation proceedings instituted by the city, whether more or less than the agreed sum, to the contrary notwithstanding. It was stated that nothing contained in the ordinance should constitute a waiver of the company's right to contest the opening of additional streets. But there is no provision purporting to limit power or authority of the city to establish or regulate street crossings over, under or upon the tracks and other property of the company. And it was specifically agreed that, if at any time the city should desire to extend and open Comanche avenue across the company's right of way and station grounds, the crossing should be constructed under the tracks located upon the fill and at grade across tracks laid at the street level, according to plans and specifications approved by the company and at the sole cost and expense of the city. The company, for this and other considerations mentioned in the ordinance, agreed to waive all claims for damages caused by the opening and establishing of this crossing.
2
3
Pursuant to the Act of Congress of March the city of McAlester was created by the consolidation of the city of South McAlester and the town of McAlester. In performance of the agreements contained in the ordinance, the city of McAlester in 1909 and again in 1912 assumed and paid portions of the cost of construction of some of the crossing covered by the ordinance; and ever since the consolidation it has been recognized and treated as the successor of the city of South McAlester and as a party to the contract. The present city is bound to the same extent as was its predecessor that passed the ordinance.
3
4
The court held that the state laws gave the commission full jurisdiction over all highways where they cross railways; that the commission had authority to order the crossing in question and to assess the cost of it against the city and the railway company, but not more than 50 per cent. against the city; that the company was the owner in fee of its right of way lands; that they could not be appropriated or damaged for public use without just compensation; and that the commission could not enforce obedience to its order to construct the grade crossing until the question of damage to the fee had been determined either by amicable settlement or by condemnation proceedings.
4
5
The order, as interpreted and affirmed, directly contravenes the provisions of the ordinance in respect of the Comanche avenue crossing. It sets at naught the undertaking of the city to bear the cost of construction and the agreement of the company to give the city the right of way for the street crossing and to waive all claims for damages. The effect is to require the company forthwith to prepare the plan and estimate, and to direct the company-upon the determination of its just compensation and the consummation of arrangements by the city to pay the portion of the cost, if any, that may be imposed upon it-to proceed to construct the underpass and to have it open for traffic within the time specified. If a contract exists between the parties in respect of this crossing, it is manifest that it would be impaired by the enforcement of the commission's order.
5
6
But defendants in error contend that the ordinance is void because it attempts to surrender police power; and therefore that there is no such contract.
6
7
It is elementary that for the safety and convenience of the public, the state, either directly or through its municipalities, may reasonably regulate the construction and use of highways where they cross railroads. The legitimate exertion of police power to that end does not violate the constitutional rights of railroad companies. They may be required at their own expense to construct bridges or viaducts whenever the elimination of grade crossings reasonably may be required, whether constructed before or after the building of the railroads. Northern Pacific Railway v. Duluth, L. Ed. Chi., Mil. & St. P. Ry. v. Minneapolis, L. Ed. Mo. Pac. Ry. v. Omaha, Erie R. R. Co. v. Public Utilities Com'rs, L. Ed. And such costs are not included in the just compensation which the railroad companies are entitled to receive. Cincinnati, I. & W. Ry. v. Connersville, Ann. Cas. Chi., Mil. & St. P. Ry. v. Minneapolis, supra. If the enforcement of its provisions operates to hamper the state's power reasonably to regulate the construction and use of the Comanche avenue crossing, then undoubtedly the ordinance is void. Chicago & Alton R. R. v. Tranbarger, L. Ed. Atlantic Coast Line v. Goldsboro, L. Ed. Denver & R. G. R. R. Co. v. Denver, L. Ed. 
7
8
The precise question is whether the agreement of the city to bear the cost of construction is inconsistent with the proper exertion of the police power.
8
9
When the ordinance was passed, it was the purpose of the parties to get rid of unauthorized crossings then in use and to arrange for the extension of platted streets across the tracks and station grounds. It was necessary for the city to obtain rights of way for that purpose, and it was empowered to acquire them by contract, purchase or condemnation. Sections Mansfield's Digest of the Statutes of Arkansas ( It could not take them without making just compensation to the owner. The company owned its right of way lands and station grounds in fee. Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Roberts, L. Ed. It was entitled to compensation for any of its property that might be taken or damaged by the construction and use of the crossings. Chieago, Burlington, etc., R. R. Co. v. Chicago, L. Ed. Cincinnati, I. & W. Ry. v. Connersville, supra.
9
10
The ordinance did not purport to limit the number of crossings that might be opened. Retention by the company of the right to resort to litigation to determine whether the opening of additional streets across the railroad is reasonably necessary does not at all impinge upon police power. Quite independently of the ordinance the opening and regulation of such crossings is subject to judicial scrutiny, and action that is arbitrary or capricious will be held invalid. Denver & R. G. R. R. Co. v. Denver, supra. Indeed the reservation contemplates the exertion of the police power and plainly implies that the parties did not intend to restrict the authority of the city to open crossings.
10
11
The agreement of the city to pay the amounts stipulated for the opening of certain crossings does not involve or contemplate any surrender of the power of eminent domain. It was authorized to contract, purchase, or condemn as it saw fit. The opinion of the state court rightly approves amicable settlement of the compensation to be given the owner. The parties were not bound to resort to litigation. It was competent for them in advance to settle the form and amount of compensation. The company's agreement to grand a right of way for the crossing was a valid consideration for the city's undertaking to bear the cost of construction.
11
12
This case is not like Northern Pacific Railroad v. Duluth, supra, cited by defendants in error. There the city had the right of way for the street, and a grade crossing existed for many years. The elimination of that crossing became necessary. The company refused to comply with the city's demands in that respect. Then a contract was made. The city agreed to build a bridge to carry the street over the railroad tracks and the company agreed to contribute $to its cost. The city undertook to maintain the bridge over the tracks for 15 years and to maintain the approaches perputually. The city built the bridge at a cost of $in addition to the amount paid by the company. Years later, when repairs were needed, the company refused to make them. This court, following the decision of the Minnesota Supreme Court (, held that the contract was without consideration, against public policy, and void. The Northern Pacific Company gave up nothing. The city already had the right of way. The company might have been required to build the bridge. The contract relieved it of a part of the cost, and attempted for all time to suspend the proper exertion of the police power in respect of maintenance. The ordinance now before us is very different from the situation and contract considered in that case.
12
13
There is nothing in the ordinance that involves any attempt to interfere with or hinder the proper exertion of police power. Evidently it was the intention of the parties to make a permanent settlement in respect of the crossings covered by the ordinance. The city was empowered to open the Comanche avenue crossing at any time without condemnation or other proceedings. Neither party could terminate the contract without the consent of the other. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Pennsyvania Co., L. R. A. The city's agreement to bear the cost of construction of the Comanche avenue crossing does not infringe the police power. The enforcement of the commission's order would deprive plaintiff in error of its property without due process of law and would impair the obligation of the contract in violation of the Constitution of the United States.

Judgment reversed.

CULVER
v.
UNITED STATES.
271 U.S. 318
HAY
v.
MAY DEPARTMENT STORES CO. et al.
Submitted April 29, 1926.
1
This case presents a question as to the jurisdiction of the District Court arising under the provision of section 28 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. § that: When there is pending in a State court any civil suit of which the District Courts of the United States are given original jurisdiction, in which 'there shall be a controversy which is wholly between citizens of different States, and which can be fully determined as between them, then either one or more of the defendants actually interested in such controversy may remove said suit into the District Court of the United States for the proper district.'
1
2
The suit was brought by Hay, a citizen of Missouri, in the Circuit Court of St. Louis, against the Stores Company, a New York corporation, and McCormick, a citizen of Missouri, to recover damages for personal injuries.
2
3
The petition alleged that the plaintiff and McCormick were employed by the Stores Company in its place of business in Missouri, in moving loaded trucks along a tunnel or passageway on its premises; that the company negligently permitted this passageway to become strewn with de bris, and negligently required its employees to push heavily loaded trucks along the passageway, unassisted, rapidly, and at short and unsafe intervals; that McCormick, who was not a reasonably safe co-employee, habitually pushed his truck at an unsafe speed, in dangerous proximity to the preceding truck, and without exercising reasonable care to avoid a collision; that, although the company knew or by the exercise of ordinary care could have known of these dangerous and negligent habits, it negligently caused and permitted him to continue to perform his duties in this negligent and unsafe manner; that on the day of the accident, while the plaintiff was engaged in pushing a loaded truck along the passageway, it was suddenly stopped by de bris obstructing the passageway, and he was struck by a loaded truck which McCormick was negligently pushing, close behind him, at a rapid rate of speed, and which 'the defendants' negligently failed to stop or divert so as to avoid the collision; and 'that the negligence of both defendants as aforesaid concurred and jointly cooperated to cause, and did directly and proximately cause, the aforesaid collision,' from which the plaintiff sustained serious and permanent injuries, to his damage in the sum of $.
3
4
The Stores Company in due time presented to the Circuit Court its petition for the removal of the cause to the District Court. The sole ground alleged for the removal was that the plaintiff's petition showed 'upon its face' that there was 'a separable controversy' in the cause between the plaintiff and the Stores Company, citizens of different States, in that, under its allegations, whatever the previous negligence of the Stores Company, the negligent failure of McCormick to stop or divert his truck so as to avoid the collision, was 'the sole proximate cause' of the collision and of the plaintiff's injuries, and that 'hence' no joint cause of action was stated against the defendants. The Circuit Court on this petition ordered the removal.
4
5
After the record had been filed in the District Court the plaintiff filed a motion to remand the cause to the Circuit Court, on the ground that it appeared upon the face of the record that the petition for removal was insufficient and the District Court had not acquired jurisdiction of the cause. This motion was overruled; to which the plaintiff excepted. Thereafter, on motion of the Stores Company, the court ordered the plaintiff to furnish security for costs within a specified time; and upon his failure to comply with this rule, the suit was dismissed, at his costs.
5
6
To obtain a review of the ruling on the jurisdictional question presented by the motion to remanded, the plaintiff applied for a direct writ of error from this court. This was allowed by the District Judge in February, 1925, under section of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. § ; and in that connection he duly certified for decision the single question whether, upon the record, the District Court acquired jurisdiction of the cause by the removal based upon a separable controversy. This question is now properly before us for review. Wilson v. Republic Iron Co.. 
6
7
It is well settled by the decisions of this court, that an action brought in a State court against two defendants jointly, in which the plaintiff states a case of joint liability arising out of the concurrent negligence of the defendants, does not present a separable controversy authorizing the removal of the cause to a Federal court, even though the plaintiff might have sued the defendants separately; the allegations of the complaint being decisive as to the nature of the controversy in the absence of a showing that one of the defendants was fraudulently joined for the purpose of preventing the removal. Louisville & Nashville Railroad v. Wangelin, L. Ed. Powers v. Chesapeake & Ohio Railway, L. Ed. Alabama Southern Railway v. Thompson, S. Ct. Ann. Cas. Chicago, R. I. & Pac. Railway v. Dowell, L. Ed. McAllister v. Chesapeake & Ohio Railway, L. Ed. Chicago & Alton Railroad v. McWhirt, L. Ed. 
7

This rule was applied in the Dowell Case, supra, where a railroad laborer, who had been run down by an engine, brought suit against the railroad company and the engineer jointly, alleging in his petition that the defective character of the engine, the unfitness and incompetency of the engineer, and his negligence and carelessness in needlessly running the engine over the plaintiff, 'concurrently and jointly contributed' to the injuries. So, in the present case, the plaintiff's petition alleged in substance that the negligence of the Stores Company in permitting the passageway to become obstructed, in requiring the employees to operate their trucks in an unsafe manner, and, specifically, in permitting McCormick, an unsafe co-employee, to handle his truck in a negligent and dangerous manner, directly concurred and jointly cooperated with McCormick's negligence in causing the plaintiff's injuries. It is clear that this petition stated on its face a case of joint liability arising from concurrent acts of negligence on the part of the defendants, cooperating to cause the injuries, and that it presented no separable controversy with the Stores Company within the established rule applicable in such cases.

271 U.S. 332
UNITED STATES
v.
ZERBEY et al.
Argued March 3, 1926.
1
This case comes before us on a certificate from the Circuit Court of Appeals. Judicial Code, § .
1
2
It appears from the certificate that Zerbey on January 23, 1920, applied to the Commission of Internal Revenue, under the provisions of the National Prohibition Act,1 for a permit to sell distilled spirits and wines for other than beverage purposes, and filed with his application a bond in the sum of $ with the National Surety Company as surety. This bond was on Form previously prescribed by the regulations, and recited, in accordance therewith that 'the conditions of this obligation is such that if the said principal shall fully and faithfully comply with all the requirements of the laws of the United States now or hereafter enacted and regulations issues pursuant thereto, respecting the sale or use of distilled spirits and wines for other than beverage purposes, then this obligation to be void; otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.' On January 26, the Commissioner issued to Zerbey a permit 'under the conditions that the provisions of the National Prohibition Act, and regulations issued thereunder, will be strictly observed.'
2
3
Thereafter the United States brought an action against Zerbey and the Surety Company in a Federal District Court, in which it was alleged that Zerbey had violated the condition of the bond in (a) failing and neglecting to keep records of his sales of distilled spirits, as required by the Prohibition Act and regulations, (b) selling and disposing of distilled spirits for beverage purposes, (c) diverting distilled spirits to other than beverage purposes, and (d) having in his possession whisky which had been withdrawn, for nonbeverage purposes only, from a bonded warehouse, of which he kept no record as required by the Prohibition Act and regulations; and that the full penal sum of the bond had been forfeited and was due by the defendants to the United States by reason of these breaches of the condition of the bond. It was not alleged that any damage or loss had been sustained by the United States as the result of these breaches. The defendants filed statutory demurrers, which were sustained by the District Court on the ground that the United States could not recover the full penal sum of the bond, but only such loss or damage as it had sustained in consequence of the breaches of the bond; and the suit was dismissed. And the case having been taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals by writ of error, it has certified that, for the proper decision of the case, it desires the instruction of this Court as to the following questions of law:
3
4
'(1) Is a bond conditioned upon compliance with the law of the United States and regulations issued pursuant thereto, respecting the sale or use of distilled spirits and wines for other than beverage purposes, given the United States by one to whom a permit to sell intoxicating liquors for other than beverage purposes has been issued under the provisions of section 6 of Title 2 of the National Prohibition Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, forfeitable upon breach of the condition in the full amount of its penal sum? (2) Is recovery upon breach of the condition of such a bond given by one holding such a permit limited to actual damages sustained by the United States?'
4
5
These questions, shortly stated, are, in effect: Whether a permit bond on Form is a forfeiture bond entitling the United States to recover the full amount named on a breach of its condition, or a bond of indemnity for the actual damages sustained by the United States from such breach.
5
6
Section 6, Title 2, of the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. c) provides, with certain exceptions not here material, that:
6
7
'No one shall manufacture, sell, purchase, transport, or prescribe any liquor without first obtaining a permit from the Commissioner so to do. * * * The Commission may prescribe the form of all permits and applications and the facts to be set forth therein. Before any permit is granted the Commissioner may require a bond in such form and amount as he may prescribe to insure compliance with the terms of the permit and the provisions of this title.'
7
8
By Title 2, § 29 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. p), it is further provided that any person violating the provisions of any permit or of this title, shall be punished by either fine or imprisonment, or both; and, by Title 2, § 35 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. v), that a tax shall be assessed against any person responsible for an illegal sale in double the amount provided by the internal revenue law, with an additional penalty.
8
9
By regulations issued by the Commissioner in October and November, 1919,2 every applicant for a permit for the sale or use of distilled spirits or wines, for other than beverage purposes, was required to furnish either a bond with corporate or personal sureties, on Form in a penal sum of from $ computed, at specified rates, on the quantity of spirits and wine which he then had on hand or would receive in the next quarterly period; or his personal bond for the same amount, secured by the deposit of Government bonds as collateral security.
9
prescribed for a surety bond-which was used by Zerbey-was conditioned, as previously stated, that the principal 'shall fully and faithfully comply with all the requirements of the laws of the United States now or hereafter enacted, and regulations issued pursuant thereto respecting the sale or use of distilled spirits and wines for other than beverage purposes.' The corresponding Form prescribed for a collateral bond, recited the pledge of Government bonds 'as security for any obligation arising hereunder,' and contained, after the general condition in Form a specific provision that 'the said principal expressly agrees that the said bonds so deposited may be sold * * * and the proceeds applied to the payment of any internal revenue taxes, interest, and penalties which may be due, and in satisfaction of any liabilities incurred hereunder, and the expenses of such sale, if any; and the residue, if any, paid to the said principal.'
10
11
Thereafter, by Regulations No. which, dated January 16, 1920, were not, it appears, published and put into effect until February 1-after the issuance of the permit of Zerbey-an applicant for a permit to sell or use distilled spirits or wines was required to file either a surety bond on a new Form or a collateral bond on a new Form provided that if the holder of such a permit had already given a bond on Form in a sufficient penal sum, a new bond should not be required until he was called upon to make an application for a new permit.
11
12
The Form thus prescribed for a surety bond,4 recites that:
12
13
'The condition of this obligation is such that if * * * the said principal shall not violate the terms of such permit * * * or * * * any of the provisions of the National Prohibition Act and regulations promulgated thereunder as now or hereafter provided, and all other laws of the United States nor or hereafter enacted respecting distilled spirits, fermented liquors, wines, or other intoxicating liquors, and will pay all taxes, assessments, fines, and penalties incurred or imposed upon him by law, then this obligation to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect.'
13
14
And Form prescribed for a collateral bond likewise provides that upon the sale of the Government's bonds pledged as security, the proceeds, shall 'be applied to the payment of any internal revenue taxes, interest, fines and penalties which may be due, and in satisfaction of any liabilities incurred hereunder and the expenses of such sale, if any, and the residue, if any, paid to said principal.'
14
15
The case now presented is not that of a bond executed to the Government in a specified penal sum prescribed by statute and intended as a fixed penalty imposed for a breach of a statutory duty, which is forfeited in its full amount by a breach of the condition irrespective of the actual damage thereby caused the Government. Clark v. Barnard, L. Ed. United States v. Dieckerhoff, L. Ed. United States v. Montell (Taney, Whether Congress did or could authorize the Commissioner in fixing the form of bond to prescribe a penalty, we need no consider; for here it is plain that he did not intend that the penal sum of a surety bond on Form should be a penalty or liquidated damages-in this case of $the full amount of which the United States might recover for any breach of condition, however slight, as, for example, a failure to make a record of sany sale as required by the regulations; but, on the contrary, intended that such penal sum should be the maximum amount of the obligation incurred by reason of a breach of the bond. Form is unquestionably to be read in connection with Form . These were prescribed by the same regulations as alternative forms of the bond which the applicant might at his election furnish. They had precisely the same object, and were intended to secure the same obligation; the one by personal sureties, the other by the deposit of collateral. Plainly it was not intended that the obligation should be greater in the one case than in the other, merely because the applicant chose to furnish personal instead of collateral security. The effect of Form is that the applicant's obligation shall be discharged by the payment of any internal revenue taxes, interest, penalties and liabilities accruing to the United States by reason of a breach of the condition; and it cannot be doubted that this was intended, in like manner, to be the measure of the obligation incurred under a surety bond on the corresponding Form .
15
16
This view is emphasized by the consideration of the new Forms prescribed by Regulations 60. It is clear that Form is not one for a penalty or forfeiture, but is one for indemnity merely in respect, broadly speaking, of the liabilities enumerated in Form . United States v. Chouteau, And the fact that these new regulations provided that a permit holder who had previously given a surety bond on Form should not be required to give a new bond on Form until called upon to make application for a new permit, is strongly persuasive evidence that the Commissioner regarded Form as of substantially the same character as Form that is, as a bond for indemnity securing the payment of the liabilities enumerated in Form .
16
17
Our answer to the certified questions is that: A permit bond on Form is not a bond for a penalty forfeitable in its entire amount upon a breach of condition, but is a bond for indemnity securing the payment of the internal revenue taxes, interest, penalties, and liabilities accruing to the United States by reason of the breach.

LEDERER
v.
McGARVEY.
Argued March 3, 1926.
1
The Circuit Court of Appeals has certified to us in this case the same questions that were submitted in United States v. Zerbey (No. L. Ed. this day decided, in reference to permit bonds covering the sale and use of distilled spirits and wines for other than beverage purposes.
1
2
It appears from the certificate that on March 20, 1920, after Regulation 60 had been promulgated, prescribing a surety bond on Form a permit was issued to O'Kane on a surety bond in the penal sum of $ executed on Form While this permit was in force O'Kane violated the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. et seq.) and the regulations by selling whisky to a pharmacy having no permit to purchase it, and failing to keep a record of the sales as required by the regulations. He was assessed with a differential tax of $ He paid this, under protest, to Lederer, the Collector of Internal Revenue. and thereafter brought suit against Lederer in a Federal District Court to recover the amount paid. Lederer, while conceding this claim, interposed a counterclaim for $on the surety bond, the full amount of which, he insisted, had become due to the United States by reason of the breach of condition. The District Court, holding that 'the amount named in the bond represents a limit, and not a measure, of liability,' denied the counterclaim, and gave O'Kane judgment for the amount of the tax paid. O'Kane v. Lederer, And the case having been taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals on a writ of error, it has certified to us, in effect, the questions whether a surety bond executed on Form after Form had been prescribed-is a forfeiture bond entitling the United States to recover the full amount named on a breach of its condition, or an indemnity bond merely.
2
3
In the brief filed in this Court in behalf of Lederer, it is now said that the decision in Sage v. United States, L. Ed. 'makes it plain that, in defending an action for the recovery of taxes alleged to have been illegally collected, a collector of internal revenue is not acting for and in behalf of the United States, but is seeking to prevent the entry of a personal judgment against himself,' and that it 'would apparently follow that the collector is without right in such a case to set up as a counterclaim an alleged indebtedness of the plaintiff to the United States.' And it is suggested that, 'as the judgment of the District Court must be affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals without regard to the points presented in the certified questions,' an answer to these questions, which would avail nothing, is not required. United States v. Buzzo, L. Ed. 812; United States v. Britton, L. Ed.

In view of the concession now made by Lederer, this suggestion is not opposed by the counsel for O'Kane's executrix. Accordingly, without answering the question certified, the certificate is dismissed.

ST. LOUIS-SAN FRANCISCO RY. CO.
v.
MILLS.
Argued April 22 and 23, 1926.
1
Respondent's intestate was employed in interstate and intrastate commerce by the petitioner, as a car inspector in its yards in Birmingham, Ala. During the railroad shopmen's strike, on the night of August 3, 1922, decedent, while returning from work to his home, on a street car, was shot to death by strikers who fired upon him, a fellow workman and a duputy sheriff employed by petitioner to guard decedent and his companion. Respondent brought suit in the circuit court of Jefferson county, Alabama, to recover for intestate's death, under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, c. (Comp. St. §§ . The cause was removed to the District Court for Northern Alabama on the gound of diversity of citizenship. Judgment for the plaintiff, the respondent here, was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. This court granted certiorari. L. Ed. 
1
2
The trial judge withdrew from the jury the question whether the guard was negligent in the performance of his duty, but left it to them to say whether upon the evidence, defendant was employed in interstate commerce at the time and place of the shooting; whether there was a duty of due care on the part of the defendant to protect decedent from violence by strikers while going from his place of employment to his home; and whether the failure of respondent to send more than a single guard to protect decedent was negligence causing his death. The instructions so given, and the refusal to direct a verdict for the defendant, are assigned as error.
2
3
Petitioner argues that the evidence did not warrant the submission of any of these questions to the jury, and contends, among other objections, that there is no evidence of a breach of any duty owing by petitioner to respondent. The question of law thus raised goes directly to the right to recover under the act upon which the action was based. See St. Louis Iron M. Ry. v. McWhirter, L. Ed. 
3
4
It is not contended that any duty growing out of the relationship of employer and employee required the employer to guard the employee against violence by strikers. Compare Davis v. Green, L. Ed. Manwell v. Durst, A. L. R. Roebuck v. Railway Co., Lewis v. Taylor Coal Co., Rourke's Case, A. L. R. Matter of Lampert v. Siemons, Nor is there any evidence of such an undertaking in the contract of employment. Hence the duty, if it existed, must be predicated upon the voluntary assumption of it by petitioner.
4
5
Taken in the aspect most favorable to respondent, the evidence shows that decedent was first employed on the Monday preceding his death, which occurred on Thursday. The strike had been in progress for some time, and 6 or 7 employees were on strike in the yard where decedent was employed. The number of strikers elsewhere does not appear. Seven guards were employed by petitioner in the yard where decedent worked, and from 50 to 75 were employed elsewhere in the city. There was some evidence that, during decedent's employment, guards had been provided for employees while at work during the day, and to accompany decedent and some others to and from their homes. There was no evidence that petitioner had ever furnished decedent or any other employee with more than one guard in going to or from work, or any other evidence from which it could be inferred that petitioner had undertaken, or held itself out as undertaking, to furnish more protection to the decedent or its other workmen than it actually did furnish.
5
6
The respondent here asserts that the defendant, having assumed to do something, should have done more. But the bare fact that the employer voluntarily provided some protection against an apprehended danger, by undertaking to do something which involved no special knowledge or skill, can give rise to no inference that it undertook to do more. Respondent therefore relies on the breach of a duty which does not exist at common law, and of whose genesis in fact it offers no evidence.
6
7
There is a similar absence of evidence of negligent failure by petitioners to fulfill this supposed duty of protection. The burden of proving negligence rested on the respondent. Patton v. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co., L. Ed. But whether a supply of guards sufficient to meet the emergency was obtainable, what demands were made upon them, and whether there were other guards available for the particular journey when the decedent was killed, are questions on which the record is silent.
7
8
Nor is there evidence from which the jury might infer that petitioner's failure to provide an additional guard or guards, was the proximate cause of decedent's death. Whether one or more additional guards would have prevented the killing is in the highest degree speculative. The undisputed evidence is that the shooting was done by one or more of three men standing of the rear platform of the car. They had come there after decedent and his companions had seated themselves in the car. Without warning they fired a volley into the car, and fled. Decedent and his guard were armed, but had no opportunity to defend themselves. On such a state of facts the jury should not have been permitted to conjecture what might have happened if an additional guard had been present. See Patton v. Texas & Pacific Ry., supra; Reading Co. v. Boyer (C. C. A.) Midland Valley R. R. v. Fulgham, 1; Laidlaw v. Sage, The evidence must at least point to the essential fact which the jury is required to find in order to sustain the verdict.
8
9
We need not inquire whether decedent was employed in interstate commerce at the time of his death, or whether the rule laid down in Erie R. R. v. Winfield, L. Ed. , can be extended, as the court below held, so as to support the judgment of the District Court.
9
10
Judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

11
Reversed.

271 U.S. 348
BLAIR, Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
v.
UNITED STATES ex rel. BIRKENSTOCK et al.
Argued May 4, 1926.
 Margaret Murphy, testatrix of respondents, paid without protest, to the collector of internal revenue at Philadelphia, the sum of $as income tax for the year a claim was filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for a refund of $as an overpayment of her taxes for the Commissioner signed a 'schedule of overassessment and allowance of abatement, credit and refund,' in the amount claimed, and gave certain instructions to the collector with respect to it. On a statement from the collector that the amount claimed was subject to refund, the Commissioner, on August 12, 1924, signed an authorization to the disbursing clerk of the Treasury to pay to respondents the refund demanded, with interest computed from November 18, 1923 (six months after the filing of the claim for refund, as provided by section of the Revenue Act of (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. j), which he deemed applicable) to May 19, 1924, the date on which the Commissioner signed the schedule of overassessment.
1
2
Respondents protested the amount of interest allowed, and demanded that it be computed on the excess of each quarterly payment from the date when it was made, in 1920, to August 12, 1924, the date upon which the Commissioner signed the authorization to the disbursing clerk. Upon the refusal of the Commissioner to allow this claim, respondents petitioned the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for a writ of mandamus to compel him to compute and allow the interest demanded. The Commissioner, the petitioner here, filed an answer, to which the respondents demurred. The Supreme Court of the District sustained the demurrer and granted the writ; and, upon appeal, the Court of Appeals sustained the judgment, modifying it in only one particular, not important to the decision in this case. This court granted certiorari. L. Ed. —.
2
3
The government having expressly waived the point made below that mandamus will not lie, only two questions are presented for consideration here. One is the date from which, the other is the date to which, interest allowed on the refund should be computed. Since the certiorari was allowed, the second question has been decided by this court in Girard Trust Co. v. United States, L. Ed. In that case we held that the date of allowance of the refund, and therefore the date to which interest should be computed under section of the Revenue Act of (Comp. St. Supp. m), is the date on which the Commissioner signed the authorization to the disbursing clerk of the Treasury, directing him to pay the refund. The court below therefore correctly held that interest should be computed to that date, which was August 12, and that, as this date was subsequent to the enactment of section of the Revenue Act of the allowance of interest must be in accordance with that section, and not section of the Act of which had been repealed. Hence we are not concerned with the ruling of the Commissioner, applying the act, that interest ran only from six months after filing of the claim for refund, because it was based on his erroneous conclusion as to the date when the refund was 'allowed.'
3
4
The question remaining for decision is from what date interest on the refund is to be computed, under section of the Act of which provides:
4
5
'Upon the allowance of a credit or refund of any internal revenue tax erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, * * * interest shall be allowed and paid on the amount of such credit or refund at the rate of 6 per centum per annum from the date such tax * * * was paid to the date of the allowance of the refund, or in case of a credit, to the due date of the amount against which the credit is taken. * * *'
5
6
The respondents contend that, as each of the quarterly installments paid by the taxpayer was in excess of one-fourth of the proper amount of the tax for the year, interest allowed on the refund should have been computed, as the court below held, on the excess of each quarterly payment, from the date on which it was paid. But the government argues that such an excess quarterly payment is not a 'tax erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,' within the meaning of section if, when it is made, any part of the proper tax for the year has not been paid; that such overpayment becomes a 'tax erroneously or illegally assessed or collected' only when the amount paid, added to the previous quarterly payments, exceeds the whole tax due for the year. In support of this position, it relies on sections of the Revenue Act of (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. uu), in force when the tax was paid. Section a) provides (page :
6
7
'That * * * the tax shall be paid in four installments, each consisting of one-fourth of the total amount of the tax. * * *
7
8
'The tax may at the option of the taxpayer be paid in a single payment instead of in installments. * * *'
8
9
Subdivision (b) of section provides (page :
9
10
'As soon as practicable after the return is filed, the Commissioner shall examine it. If it then appears that the correct amount of the tax is greater or less than that shown in the return, the installments shall be recomputed. If the amount already paid exceeds that which should have been paid on the basis of the installments as recomputed, the excess so paid shall be credited against the subsequent installments; and if the amount already paid exceeds the correct amount of the tax, the excess shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of section '
10
11
'That if, upon examination of any return of income made pursuant to this act * * * it appears that an amount of income * * * tax has been paid in excess of that properly due, then, notwithstanding the provisions of section of the Revised Statutes, the amount of the excess shall be credited against any income, war-profits or excess profits taxes, or installment thereof, then due from the taxpayer under any other return, and any balance of such excess shall be immediately refunded to the taxpayer. * * *'
11
12
By section a) the payment of the whole tax in a single payment is expressly made optional with the taxpayer, and any payment in excess of the correct amount of a quarterly installment is by section a) to be treated as a payment on account of the whole tax. It is clear that a taxpayer who, anticipating the required quarterly installments, pays the entire tax in one payment, is not entitled to interest or a discount, on the anticipated installments, as upon a 'tax erroneously or illegally assessed or collected' under section of the Act of .
12
13
We think that under any reasonable interpretation of section the payment of a lesser amount which is in excess of the required quarterly installments must stand on the same footing. Under sections of the Act of there is no provision for a refund to the taxpayer of any excess payment of a quarterly installment, when the whole tax for the year has not been paid. Read together, these sections show that the mere overpayment of an installment is treated as a payment on account of the tax which is assessed for that year, and is not a 'tax erroneously or illegally assessed or collected' within the meaning of the refund provisions of section of the Act of and so is not subject to its provisions regulating the allowance of interest. Payments in excess of the total amount of the tax, then and subsequently made, are subject to refund or credit under the provisions of section and interest must be allowed on them at the rate of 6 per cent. from the date of payment.
13
14
The provision of section that 'in case of a credit' interest is to be allowed 'to the due date of the amount against which the credit is taken,' relates to a credit properly allowed of a 'tax erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,' and has no application to excess payments of quarterly installments which the government was entitled to treat as an advance payment of later installments, under the provisions of section .
14
15
The judgment below was erroneous, in so far as it allowed interest on payments made prior to September 27, 1920, on which date the total amount of the installments paid first exceeded the total amount of tax due, by the sum of $ Interest should have been allowed on that amount from that date, and on the full amount of the fourth installment from December 13, 1920, when it was paid.
15
16
Judgment reversed with costs to the respondent.

271 U.S. 354
UNITED STATES
v.
KATZ et al. UNITED STATES v. FEUERSTEIN et al.
Argued March 11, 1926.
1
The two defendants in error in each of these cases were indicted in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for a conspiracy to sell intoxicating liquors without making a permanent record of the sale, in violation of section 10, title 2 of the National Prohibition Act of October (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. e).
1
2
The indictment in No. charged that the defendant Katz conspired with the defendant Senn to sell for the Stewart Distilling Company to Senn a quantity of whisky, without making a record of the sale. A similar offense was charged against the defendants named in the indictment in No. 
2
3
Demurrers and motions to quash were interposed to both indictments, on the ground that they failed to charge any crime. In support of this contention it was argued that section 10, which requires a permanent record to be made of sales of intoxicating liquors, applies only to persons authorized by the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. et seq.) to sell alcoholic liquor, and that the indictment failed to allege that either of the defendants charged with making the sales, or the Stewart Distilling Company, held a permit, or was otherwise authorized to sell. The indictments were quashed by the District Court. The cases come here on writ of error to the District Court, under the provisions of the Criminal Appeals Act of March (Comp. St. § .
3
4
The overt act charged in each indictment was the sale of whisky by one defendant to the other. This is an offense under the National Prohibition Act; but as the defendants in each case were only one buyer and one seller, and as the agreement of the parties was an essential element in the sale, an indictment of the buyer and seller for a conspiracy to make the sale would have been of doubtful validity. Compare United States v. N. Y. C. & H. R. R. (C. C.) United States v. Dietrich (C. C.) Vannata v. United States (C. C. A.) This embarrassment could be avoided in an indictment for a criminal conspiracy only if the buyer and seller were charged with conspiring to commit a substantive offense having an ingredient in addition to the sale, not requiring the agreement of two persons for its completion. See Chadwick v. United States. 
4
5
Hence the government takes the position that the seller of intoxicating liquor is required by the statute to keep a permanent record of his sales, whether lawful or unlawful, and that failure to do so is itself a crime, from which it would follow that a conspiracy to effect a sale without such a record is an indictable offense. No question is made but that persons authorized to deal in alcoholic liquors under the Prohibition Act are required to make permanent records of their transactions. But the government, to support a charge of conspiracy applicable to buyer and seller, relies on the literal application of title 2, § 10:
5
6
'No person shall manufacture, purchase for sale, sell, or transport any liquor without making at the time a permanent record thereof showing in detail the amount and kind of liquor manufactured, purchased, sold, or transported. together with the names and addresses of the persons to whom sold, in case of sale, and the consignor and consignee in case of transportation, and the time and place of such manufacture, sale, or transportation. The Commissioner may prescribe the form of such record, which shall at all times be open to inspection as in this act provided.'
6
7
Title 2, § 34 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. u), provides:
7
8
'All records and reports kept or filed under the provisions of this act shall be subject to inspection at any reasonable hour by the Commissioner or any of his agents or by any public prosecutor or by any person designated by him, or by any peace officer in the state where the record is kept, and copies of such records and reports duly certified by the person with whom kept or filed may be introduced in evidence with like effect as the originals thereof, and verified copies of such records shall be furnished to the Commissioner when called for.'
8
9
To uphold the contention of the government, therefore, the language of section 10 must be taken to apply not only to those who hold government permits authorizing them to deal in intoxicating liquors under a familiar system of regulation, to whom it admittedly is applicable, but to every criminal violator of the National Prohibition Act, even though making only a single, isolated sale. It must be taken also to extend the provisions of section 34, clearly applicable to such permittees, in such a way as to present the incongruity of a system of records to be kept by criminal violators of the act who are not permittees, in a form which the Commissioner may prescribe, which may be introduced in evidence on the certification of the person 'with whom kept,' and verified copies of which are to be furnished on demand, presumably by the criminal keeping the record.
9
10
We are not now concerned with any question of legislative power to establish such a system but only with the question whether it was the intention of Congress to do so.

All laws are to be given a sensible construction; and a literal application of a statute, which would lead to absurd consequences, should be avoided whenever a reasonable application can be given to it, consistent with the legislative purpose. See Hawaii v. Mankichi, L. Ed. and cases there cited. In ascertaining that purpose, we may examine the title of the act (United States v. Fisher, L. Ed. 304; United States v. Palmer, L. Ed. 471; Holy Trinity Church v. United States, States v. Saunders, the source in previous legislation of the particular provision in question (United Seates v. Saunders, Viterbo v. Friedlander, L. Ed. United States v. Morrow, L. Ed. , and the legislative scheme or plan by which the general purpose of the act is to be carried out. See Platt v. Union Pacific R. R., Bernier v. Bernier, L. Ed. 
11
12
One purpose of the National Prohibition Act was to suppress the entire traffic in intoxicating liquor as a beverage. Grogan v. Walker & Sons, L. Ed. But the Eighteenth Amendment did not prohibit the use of intoxicating liquor for other than beverage purposes, and an important purpose of the act, as its title1 and contents show, was to regulate the manufacture, tansportation, and use of intoxicating liquor for other than beverage purposes.
12
13
Section 3, title 2 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. aa) which prohibits the manufacture, sale, and possession of intoxicating liquor, expressly provides that:
13
14
'Liquor for nonbeverage purposes and wine for sacramental purposes may be manufactured, purchased, sold bartered, transported, imported, exported, delivered, furnished and possessed, but only as herein provided, and the commissioner may, upon application, issue permits therefor. * * *'
14
15
To make the prohibitions of the act effective, and to provide for the production and use of liquor for nonbeverage purposes, it became necessary for the government to regulate and supervise those uses of intoxicating liquor which were not prohibited. Congress had before it the provisions of the Revenue Law (Comp. Stat. governing distillers, rectifiers, and brewers, requiring detailed records of all transactions, and laying down other regulations designed to promote the effective collection of liquor taxes; it also had before it the regulatory system devised by the Internal Revenue Bureau for carrying into effect the prohibitory legislation contained in the Food Control Act of August (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. r), and subsequent war legislation. See .
15
16
The business affected by this legislation was lawful business, subject to governmental regulation; records of transactions were required to be kept, as a condition of receiving government permission to operate, and such records were a convenient and necessary means for protecting the interests of the government with respect to its revenues. When Congress came to enact the National Prohibition Act, a similar method of permit or license and a similar system of records afforded a convenient means for the regulation and control of those dealing with alcoholic liquors for the nonbeverage purposes as authorized by the statute.
16
17
The reports of the committees of the Senate and House having the bill in charge, as well as the statute as adopted, indicate clearly that the purpose of Congress was to take over an established and well-known system of granting permits and requiring reports and records, for the purpose of regulating and controlling such portion of the liquor traffic as had not been prohibited by the Eighteenth Amendment and the National Prohibition Act.2 The report of the Senate Committee is also persuasive that the provisions of title 2, § 34, already quoted, relating to 'all records and reports kept or filed under the provisions of this act,' refer to records and reports required of permittees.3 Nowhere in the reports of the committees does it appear that any such novel legislation was being proposed as is here contended for by the government. On the contrary, it is stated in the report of the House Judiciary Committee, page 7, that:
17
18
'Title 2 for the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment has in it no new or experimental features. Every provision in it has precedents in state or federal legislation.'
18
19
The government does not suggest that there is in fact any precedent in legislation, state or national, for the interpretation which it urges here.
19
20
Of the 39 sections in title 2 of the act, which deals with national prohibition, more than half, including the 7 sections which precede section 10, contain provisions authorizing or regulating the manufacture, sale, transportation, or use of intoxicating liquor for nonbeverage purposes.4 These provisions, read together, clearly indicate a statutory plan or scheme to regulate the disposition of alcoholic liquor not prohibited by the Eighteenth Amendment, in such manner as to minimize the danger of its diversion from authorized or permitted uses to beverage purposes. These provisions plainly relate to those persons who are authorized to sell, transport, use or possess intoxicating liquors under the Eighteenth Amendment and the provision of section 3 of the act, already quoted.
20
21
No section of the act requiring records to be made of dealings in alcoholic liquors relates to any but dealings authorized or permitted under the statute, unless it be section 10. The question is thus presented, whether the requirement of section 10 that 'no person shall * * * sell * * * liquor without making at the time a permanent record thereof' is a regulatory measure applicable to persons authorized to deal in nonbeverage liquors, or whether it was intended to add to the crime of manufacturing, selling or transporting, a second offense, whenever the person committing the crime should fail to make a record of his own wrongdoing. When the statute is read as a whole, and the implications of the latter interpretation are taken into account, we think that it is not a reasonable or a fairly admissible interpretation.
21
22
General terms descriptive of a class of persons made subject to a criminal statute may and should be limited, where the literal application of the statute would lead to extreme or absurd results, and where the legislative purpose gathered from the whole act would be satisfied by a more limited interpretation. United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, L. Ed. , Holy Trinity Church v. United States, supra; United States v. Kirby, L. Ed. 278; United States v. Palmer, supra.
22
23
In United States v. Palmer, the defendants, not citizens of the United States, were indicted for a robbery committed on a foreign vessel on the high seas, under a statute which provided that, 'if any person or persons shall commit, upon the high seas, * * * out of the jurisdiction of any particular state, murder or robbery, * * *' such offender should be guilty of piracy and punishable with death. Chief Justice Marshall pointed out that Congress, under its constitutional power to define and punish piracy, had authority to make a statute applicable to the defendants; but, applying the principle of statutory construction to which we have referred, he held that the words 'any person or persons,' although broad enough to comprehend every human being, could not, in view of the exceptional consequences of a literal application, and the intent of the Legislature, as derived from the title of the act and a reading of the whole statute, be construed to apply to persons, not citizens, who committed offenses on foreign vessels on the high seas.
23
24
In United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, supra, the defendant was indicted for a conspiracy 'to have in * * * possession' of another person, not registered, a quantity of opium, in violation of the Opium Registration Act of ), which declared it unlawful for 'any person,' who had not registered and paid the prescribed tax, to have in his possession or control any of the drug in question. This court held that the words 'any person not registered' could not be taken to apply to any person in the United States, but must be read, in harmony with the purpose of the act, to refer to persons required by law to register.
24
25
We think the reasoning of these cases applicable here, and that the words 'no person' in section 10 refer to persons authorized under other provisions of the act to carry on traffic in alcoholic liquors. It is not without significance that the Commissioner has never made any regulation with respect to records of bootlegging transactions, and that the published regulations contain no suggestion that section 10 has any application, except to persons who hold permits, or are otherwise authorized by law to traffic in intoxicating liquor. See National Lead Co. v. United States, L. Ed.

Report No. of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Aug. to accompany H. R. which became the National Prohibition Act, contains the following statement on page 20:
'The provisions requiring those who sell or manufacture liquor for nonbeverage purposes to secure a permit is a continuation of the system now enforced by the federal authorities. It is the most effective means to insure obedience to the law and prevents the diversion of liquor for illegal purposes. It is a slight burden on the law-abiding citizens who are dealing in liquor for legal purposes.'
Report No. 91, part 1, of the House Judiciary Committee, June 30, 1919, to accompany H. R. contains the following statement on page 2:
'Title 2, to enforce prohibition under the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, contains substantially the same features at title 1 and in addition a system of permits such as is now in force under regulations of the Revenue Department, Treasury Decision and in the various prohibition codes. These permits are designed to prevent diversion of liquor from legal to illegitimate uses. This system greatly lessens prosecution by making it difficult for persons to obtain liquor except for legitimate purposes. In addition to the permit system, which is also provided for in title 3 (the industrial alcohol section) the act carries a number of the more essential penal provisions of the ordinary prohibition codes, such as those against advertising liquor.'

The Senate Report, pages 7, 8, contains the following statement with reference to the provisions of the present section 34 of the National Prohibition Act:
'The requirement of section 35 (now 34)-that the Commissioner file all the reports, statements, and information required by title II as a part of the files of his office, in a permanent record, alphabetically arranged, with an indorsement showing the date when filed, etc., and to furnish certified copies of such reports, statements, and information to any person requesting the same-is deemed by the committee an unnecessary requirement, and one which will result in cumbering the office of the commissioner with reports, information, and data which would serve no useful purpose; that for all practical purposes it will be sufficient if all records and reports kept on file under the provisions of the act shall be subject to inspection by the Commissioner or any of his agents, or by any public prosecutor or any person designated by him, and that copies of such records and reports, duly certified, may be introduced in evidence with like effect as the originals thereof. The committee has amended section 35 (now 34) accordingly. Section 10, it will be observed, authorizes the Commissioner to prescribe the form of the permanent record to be made by the manufacturer, purchaser, seller, or transporter of any liquor, and requires that such permanent record be at all times open to inspection by the Commissioner or his agents.'

3

4
The following examples may be noted:
Section 4 exempts from the operation of the act denatured alcohol, medicinal and toilet preparations, etc. It authorizes the manufacture of these articles and the purchase and possession of alcoholic liquors for that purpose under government permit, and requires the manufacturer to 'keep the records, and make the reports specified in this act and as directed by the Commissioner.'
Section 5 provides for the revocation of permits, if the product manufactured does not comply with the requirements of section 4.
Section 6 prohibits the sale, purchase, transportation, or prescription of liquor without a permit from the Commissioner, issued as prescribed in the section, except the purchase and use for medicinal purposes and for the treatment of alcoholism. This section also exempts sacramental wines from the provisions of the act, except as to the requirements of section 6 for permits (save for purchase) and to the requirements of section 10 for the keeping of records.
Section 7 authorizes physicians to prescribe liquor under government permit and requires a record of such prescriptions.
Section 9 authorizes proceedings for the revocation of permits for the violation of the act, and section 27 provides that seized liquor may, under order of the court, be ordered sold to persons holding permits to purchase.
Section 11 requires manufacturers and wholesale or retail druggists, to keep, as part of the records required of them a copy of all permits to purchase on which sales are made, and prohibits them from selling except to persons having permits to purchase.
Section 12 requires manufacturers of liquor for sale to attach to every package a label describing its contents.
Section 13 makes it the duty of every carrier to make a record at the place of shipment of the receipt of any liquor transported, and section 14 requires the packages carried to be labeled in a specified way.

271 U.S. 426
OLD COLONY TRUST CO.
v.
CITY OF SEATTLE et al.
271 U.S. 432
UNITED STATES
v.
CANDELARIA et al.
Argued Nov. 18, 19, 1925.
the United States brought a suit in the federal District Court for New Mexico against Jose Candelaria and others to quiet in the Indian pueblo of Laguma the title to certain lands alleged to belong to the pueblo in virtue of a grant from Spain, its recognition by Mexico, and a confirmation and patent by the United States. The suit was brought on the theory that these Indians are wards of the United States, and that it therefore has authority and is under a duty to protect them in the ownership and enjoyment of their lands. The defendants were alleged to be asserting a false claim to the lands, and to be occupying and fencing the same to the exclusion of the Indians. In their answer the defendants denied the wardship of the United States, and also set up in bar two decrees rendered in prior suits brought against them by the pueblo to quiet the title to the same lands. One suit was described as begun in 1910 in the territorial court, and transferred when New Mexico became a state to the succeeding state court, where on final hearing a decree was given for the defendants on the merits. The other was described as brought in 1916 in the federal District Court, and resulting in a decree of dismissal on the grounds that the complaint disclosed that the matters presented 'were res judicata and that there was no federal question in the case.' In the replication the United States alleged that it was not a party to either of the prior suits; that it neither authorized the bringing of them, nor was represented by the attorney who appeared for the pueblo, and therefore that it was not bound by the decrees.
1
2
On the case thus presented the court held that the decrees operated to bar the prosecution of the present suit by the United States, and on that ground that bill was dismissed. An appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals which, after outlining the case as just stated, has certified to this court the following questions:
2
3
(1) Are Pueblo Indians in New Mexico in such status of tutelage as to their lands in that state that the United States, as such guardian, is not barred either by a judgment in a suit involving title to such lands begun in the territorial court and passing to judgment after statehood or by a judgment in a similar action in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, where, in each of said actions, the United States was not a party nor was the attorney representing such Indians therein authorized so to do by the United States?
3
4
(2) Did the state court of New Mexico have jurisdiction to enter a judgment which would be res judicata as to the United States, in an action between Pueblo Indians and opposed claimants concerning title to land, where the result of that judgment would be to disregard a survey made by the United States of a Spanish or Mexican grant pursuant to an act of Congress confirming such grant to said Pueblo Indians?
4
5
The status of the Pueblo Indians and their lands, and the relation of the United States to both, were considered in United States v. Sandoval, L. Ed. We there said (pages ):
5
6
'Not only does the Constitution expressly authorize Congress to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes, but long-continued legislative and executive usage and an unbroken current of judicial decisions have attributed to the United States as a superior and civilized nation the power and duty of exercising a fostering care and protection over all dependent Indian communities within its borders, whether within its original territory or territory subsequently acquired, and whether within or without the limits of a state. * * * 'It is for that body (Congress), and not for the courts, to determine when the true interests of the Indian require his release from such condition of tutelage.'
6
7
'Of course, it is not meant by this that Congress may bring a community or body of people within the range of this power by arbitrarily calling them an Indian tribe, but only that in respect of distinctly Indian communities the questions whether, to what extent, and for what time they shall be recognized and dealt with as dependent tribes requiring the guardianship and protection of the United States are to be determined by Congress, and not by the courts. * * *
7
8
'As before indicated, by a uniform course of action beginning as early as and continued up to the present time, the legislative and executive branches of the government have regarded and treated the Pueblos of New Mexico as dependent communities, entitled to its aid and protection, like other Indian tribes, and, considering their Indian lineage, isolated and communal life, primitive customs, and limited civilization, this assertion of guardianship over them cannot be said to be arbitrary but must be regarded as both authorized and controlling.'
8
9
'We are not unmindful that in United States v. Joseph, there are some observations not in accord with what is here said of these Indians, but as that case did not turn upon the power of Congress over them or their property, but upon the interpretation and purpose of a statute not nearly so comprehensive as the legislation now before us, and as the observations there made respecting the Pueblos were evidently based upon statements in the opinion of the territorial court, then under review, which are at variance with other recognized sources of information, now available, and with the long continued action of the legislative and executive departments, that case cannot be regarded as holding that these Indians or their lands are beyond the range of congressional power under the Constitution.'
9
10
While we recognized in that case that the Indians of each pueblo, collectively as a community, have a fee-simple title to the lands of the pueblo (other than such as are occupied under executive orders), we held that their lands, like the tribal lands of other Indians owned in fee under patents from the United States, are 'subject to the legislation of Congress enacted in the exercise of the government's guardianship' over Indian tribes and their property.
10
11
The purpose of Congress to subject the Pueblo Indians and their lands to that legislation, if not made certain before the decision in the Joseph Case, was made so in various ways thereafter. Two manifestations of it are significant. A decision of the territorial court in 1904, holding their lands taxable (Territory v. Delinquent Tax List of Bernalillo County, was promptly followed by a congressional enactment annulling the taxes already levied and forbidding further levies (; and a decision of that court in 1907, construing the statute which prohibits the sale of liquor to Indians and its introduction into the Indian country as not including these Indians or their lands (United States v. Mares, was shortly followed by an enactment declaring that the statute should be construed as including both (. It also is of significance that in 1898 Congress provided for the employment by the Secretary of the Interior of a special attorney to represent the Pueblo Indians and protect their interests (, and that from that time to this a special attorney has been so employed and has been paid out of the appropriations made by Congress for the purpose (.
11
12
Many provisions have been enacted by Congress-some general and others special-to prevent the government's Indian wards from improvidently disposing of their lands and becoming homeless public charges. One of these provisions, now embodied in section of the Revised Statutes, declares:
12
13
'No purchase, grant, lease, or other conveyance of lands, or of any title or claim thereto, from any Indian nation or tribe of Indians, shall be of any validity in law or equity, unless the same be made by treaty or convention entered into pursuant to the Constitution.' Comp. St. § .
13
14
This provision was originally adopted in , and, with others 'regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes,' was extended over 'the Indian tribes' of New Mexico in .
14
15
While there is no express reference in the provision to Pueblo Indians, we think it must be taken as including them. They are plainly within its spirit, and, in our opinion, fairly within its words, 'any tribe of Indians.' Although sedentary, industrious, and disposed to peace, they are Indians in race, customs, and domestic government, always have lived in isolated communities, and are a simple, uniformed people, ill-prepared to cope with the intelligence and greed of other races. It therefore is difficult to believe that Congress in 1851 was not intending to protect them, but only the nomadic and savage Indians then living in New Mexico A more reasonable view is that the term 'Indian tribe' was used in the acts of in the sense of 'a body of Indians of the same or a similar race, united in a community under one leadership or government, and inhabiting a particular, though sometimes ill-defined, territory.' Montoya v. United States. In that sense the term easily includes Pueblo Indians.
15
16
Under the Spanish law, Pueblo Indians, although having full title to their lands, were regarded as in a state of tutelage, and could alienate their lands only under governmental supervision. See Chouteau v. Molony, Text-writers have differed about the situation under the Mexican law; but in United States v. Pico, this court, speaking through Mr. Justice Field, who was specially informed on the subject, expressly recognized that under the laws of Mexico the government 'extended a special guardianship' over Indian pueblos, and that a convveyance of pueblo lands, to be effective, must be made 'under the supervision and with the approval' of designated authorities. And this was the ruling in Sunol v. Hepburn, et seq. Thus it appears that Congress, in imposing a restriction on the alienation of these lands, as we think it did, was but continuing a policy which prior governments had deemed essential to the protection of such Indians.
16
17
It was settled in Lane v. Pueblo of Santa Rosa, L. Ed. that under territorial laws enacted with congressional sanction each pueblo in New Mexico-meaning the Indians comprising the community-became a juristic person and enabled to sue and defend in respect of its lands. But in that case there was no occasion, and no attempt, to determine whether or to what extent the United States would be bound by the outcome of such a litigation where it was not a party. That was a suit brought by the pueblo of Santa Rosa to enjoin the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the General Land Office from carrying out what was alleged to be an unauthorized purpose and attempt to dispose of the pueblo's lands as public lands of the United States. Arizona was formed from part of New Mexico, and when in that way the pueblo came to be in the new territory it retained its juristic status. Beyond establishing that status, and recognizing that the wardship of the Indians was not an obstacle to the suit, the case is without bearing here. In the opinion it was said:
17
18
'The Indians are not here seeking to establish any power or capacity in themselves to dispose of the lands, but only to prevent a threatened disposal of administrative officers in disregard of their full ownership. Of their capacity to maintain such a suit we entertain no doubt. The existing wardship is not an obstacle, as is shown by repeated decisions of this court, of which Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, L. Ed. is an illustration.'
18
19
With this explanation of the status of the Pueblo Indians and their lands, and of the relation of the United States to both, we come to answer the questions propounded in the certificate.
19
20
To the first question we answer that the United States is not barred. Our reasons will be stated. The Indians of the pueblo are wards of the United States, and hold their lands subject to the restriction that the same cannot be alienated in any wise without its consent. A judgment or decree which operates directly or indirectly to transfer the lands from the Indians, where the United States has not authorized or appeared in the suit, infringes that restriction. The United States has an interest in maintaining and enforcing the restriction, which cannot be affected by such a judgment or decree. This court has said in dealing with a like situation:
20
21
'It necessarily follows that, as a transfer of the allotted lands contrary to the inhibition of Congress would be a violation of the governmental rights of the United States arising from its obligation to a dependent people, no stipulations, contracts, or judgments rendered in suits to which the Government is a stranger, can affect its interest. The authority of the United States to enforce the restraint lawfully created cannot be impaired by any action without its consent.' Bowling & Miami Investment Co. v. United States. 
21
22
And that ruling has been recognized and given effect in other cases. Privett v. United States, L. Ed. Sunderland v. United States. 
22
23
But, as it appears that for many years the United States has employed and paid a special attorney to represent the Pueblo Indians and look after their interests, our answer is made with the qualification that, if the decree was rendered in a suit begun and prosecuted by the special attorney so employed and paid, we think the United States is as effectually concluded as if it were a party to the suit. Souffront v. Compagnie des Sucreries, L. Ed. Lovejoy v. Murray, L. Ed. 129; Claflin v. Fletcher (C. C.) Maloy v. Duden, James v. Germania Iron Co.. 
23
24
Coming to the second question, we eliminate so much of it as refers to a possible disregard of a survey made by the United States, for that would have no bearing on the court's jurisdiction or the binding effect of the judgment or decree, but would present only a question of whether error was committed in the course of exercising jurisdiction. With that eliminated, our answer to the question is that the state court had jurisdiction to entertain the suit and proceed to judgment or decree. Whether the outcome would be conclusive on the United States is sufficiently shown by our answer to the first question.
24
25
Questions answered as stated in this opinion.

271 U.S. 445
KANSAS CITY TERMINAL RY. CO. et al.
v.
CENTRAL UNION TRUST CO. OF NEW YORK et al.
Argued April 23, 1926.
1
This cause is here on certificate from the United States Circuit Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit. Judicial Code, § . The relevant facts and the submitted questions follow.
1
2
In a proceeding by creditors, the United States District Court, Eastern District of Missouri, appointed a receiver for the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company. Appellees asked foreclosure of liens upon the whole property, and procured an order of sale. According to a plan for purchase and reorganization, with definite offers to lien creditors, unsecured creditors, and stockholders, Blumenthal and another bid in the assets and then assigned the rights so acquired to the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Company, a newly organized Missouri corporation.
2
3
Pending entry of the final decree, appellants asserted preferential rights. These were denied, and they were held to be unsecured contract creditors. Kansas City Terminal Ry. Co. v. Central Union Trust Co. (C. C. A.) Thereupon they challenged the reorganization plan as unfair to them and unduly preferential to stockholders of the insolvent corporation. The trial court overuled their objection, the matter went to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and it has asked for instruction.
3
4
The reorganization scheme required the issuance of four classes of securities by the new company:
4
5
(1) Prior lien mortgage bonds (authorized, $.
5
6
(2) Cumulative adjustment, or income, bonds (authorized, $, secured by mortgage as to principal.
6
7
(3) Preferred stock (authorized, $.
7
8
(4) Common stock, without par value (authorized, shares).
8
9
Specified amounts of each of these were reserved for future use by the new company. Some of the prior lien bonds bore interest at 4, some at 5, and some at 6 per cent.
9
10
New securities were offered to the holders of seventeen separate issues of outstanding bonds of the old company and its various subsidiaries, secured by mortgage, and one issue of notes, secured by the pledge of mortgage bonds. In some cases, but not all, cash was offered to holders of these secured claims in addition to the new securities. Always the par amount of the new securities offered (taking the new nonpar value common stock at $per share), plus the cash offered, if any, equaled, but never exceeded, the principal amount of the old securities, in respect of which the offer was made, plus interest to January 1, 1922.
10
11
Of these eighteen outstanding issues, five were offered new prior lien bonds and cash; one was offered new prior lien bonds; five were offered new prior lien bonds and new adjustment bonds; three were offered new prior lien bonds, new adjustment bonds, and new preferred stock; one was offered new adjustment bonds and new preferred stock; three were offered new adjustment bonds, new preferred stock, and new common stock.
11
12
In all cases the new prior lien bonds and the new adjustment bonds (whether offered to secured creditors, unsecured creditors, or stockholders) were to bear interest from January 1, 1922.
12
13
As to stockholders and unsecured creditors, it was provided: (1) Preferred stockholders might receive $14 in prior lien bonds (bearing 6 per cent.), $6 in adjustment bonds, and one share of common stock in the new company, upon payment of $20 for each $share of old stock. (2) Common stockholders might receive $per cent. prior lien mortgage bonds, $in adjustment bonds, and one share of common stock, upon payment of $25 for each $share of old stock. (3) Unsecured creditors were given the choice of two plans: (a) One-third of a share of preferred stock, $par value, and two-thirds of a share of common stock without par value, for each $of their claims, plus interest to January 1, 1922 (whereas the receiver was appointed and took possession of the property September 27, 1915, foreclosure decree was entered June 30, 1922, offer to creditors was dated July 15, 1922, foreclosure sale was had December 13, 1922, order confirming the sale was entered February 9, 1923, and order approving the master's deed conveying the property to the new company was entered on March 10, 1923); (b) $14 in prior lien mortgage 6 per cent. bonds, $6 in adjustment mortgage bonds, and one share of common stock, upon payment of $18 for each $of their claims.
13
14
Appellants maintained below that Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, L. Ed. and Louisville Trust Co. v. Louisville Railway Co., L. Ed. require that an offer in a reorganization plan, in order to be fair and binding upon him, must preserve 'to the creditor his relative priority over the stockholder. It is not sufficient that he should get a little more than the stockholder. His entire claim must take precedence over any part of the interest of a stockholder. It is not sufficient that he be offered securities of the same grade as the stockholder, but a trifle more in amount, or that the stockholder's right to participate be conditioned upon the payment of an assessment.'
14
15
I. Is a plan of reorganization of a railway company sufficient as to unsecured creditors, and binding upon them, which does not give precedence to the entire claim of the creditor over any part or interest of a stockholder in the old company?
15
16
II. Is such a plan fair and binding upon such creditors, even though they be offered securities of the same grade as the stockholders, the difference being only in the greater amount offered the creditors, provided the court shall be of the opinion that the offer tenders to such creditors all that could reasonably be expected under all of the existing circumstances?
16
17
III. Is such offer as to such creditors fair and binding, if it consists only of the same grade of securities as offered the stockholders, the difference being that the right of the stockholders to participate is conditioned upon the payment of an assessment or the payment of a relatively greater assessment than that asked of such creditors, provided the court shall be of the opinion that the offer tenders to such creditor all that could reasonably be expected under all of the existing circumstances?
17
18
These questions lack precision, and the accompanying statement of facts fails to reveal the detail of the situation with desirable clearness. There is nothing to show the amount or character of the insolvent company's outstanding securities, or the amount of the unsecured indebtedness, or the probable value of the equity in the property beyond secured debts, or the amount of money deemed necessary to insure successful operation of the new company. The questions, therefore, must be defined and answered with certain qualifications.
18
19
Chicago, etc., Railroad Co. v. Howard, L. Ed. Louisville Trust Co. v. Louisville Railway Co., L. Ed. and Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, L. Ed. gave much consideration to the general principles which must control the present cause. These were applied in Kansas City, etc., Railway Co. v. Guardian Trust Co., L. Ed. and Pierce v. United States, L. Ed. 
19

We accept those opinions as authoritative, and it now may be announced as settled doctrine that, where the value of corporate property to be sold under foreclosure is so great as to render co-operation between bondholders and stockholders essential in order to secure a bidder and prevent undue sacrifice of their interests, they may enter into a fair and open arrangement to that end. But 'no such proceedings can be rightfully carried to consummation which recognize and preserve any interest in the stockholders, without also recognizing and preserving the interests, not merely of the mortgagee, but of every creditor of the corporation. In other words, if the bondholder wishes to foreclose and exclude inferior lienholders, or general unsecured creditors and stockholders, he may do so; but a foreclosure which attempts to preserve any interest or right of the mortgagor in the property after the sale must necessarily secure and preserve the prior rights of general creditors thereof. This is based upon the familiar rule that the stockholder's interest in the property is subordinate to the rights of creditors, first of secured and then of unsecured creditors. And any arrangement of the parties by which the subordinate rights and interests of the stockholders are attempted to be secured at the expense of the prior rights of either class of creditors comes within judicial denunciation.' Louisville Trust Co. v. Louisville Railway Co.. 
20
21
This doctrine is the 'fixed principle' according to which Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, declares the character of reorganization agreements must be determined, and to it there should be rigid adherence. But, as that opinion states, this does not require the impossible, and make it necessary always to pay unsecured creditors in cash before stockholders may retain any interest whatever in the reorganized company. By way of illustration it further pointed out, that such creditors can be protected 'by the issuance, on equitable terms, of income bonds or preferred stock.' And we now add that, when necessary, they may be protected through other arrangements, which distinctly recognize their equitable right to be preferred to stockholders against the full value of all property belonging to the debtor corporation, and afford each of them fair opportunity, measured by the existing circumstances, to avail himself of this right.
21
22
Unsecured creditors of insolvent corporations are entitled to the benefit of the values which remain after lienholders are satisfied, whether this is present or prospective, for dividends or only for purposes of control. But reasonable adjustments should be encouraged. Practically, it is impossible to sell the property of a great railroad for cash and, generally, the interests of all parties, including the public, are best served by co-operation between bondholders and stockholders. If creditors decline a fair offer based upon the principles above stated, they are left to protect themselves. After such refusal they cannot attack the reorganization in a court of equity. Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd. 
22
23
Question I, if interpreted strictly and according to the ordinary meaning of the words employed, must be answered in the negative. We assume that to 'give precedence' implies recognition of superior importance. As above stated, to the extent of their debts creditors are entitled to priority over stockholders against all the property of an insolvent corporation. But it does not follow that in every reorganization the securities offered to general creditors must be superior in rank or grade to any which stockholders may obtain. It is not impossible to accord to the creditor his superior rights in other ways. Generally, additional funds will be essential to the success of the undertaking, and it may be impossible to obtain them, unless stockholders are permitted to contribute and retain an interest sufficiently valuable to move them. In such or similar cases the chancellor may exercise an informed discretion concerning the practical adjustment of the several rights.
23
24
Question II is answered in the affirmative, with the qualifications which follow. The primary right of unsecured creditors to the assets of an insolvent corporation remaining after lienholders are satisfied, must be adequately protected, and to each one of them there must be given such opportunity as the circumstances permit to secure the full enjoyment of this preference.
24
25
Question III is also answered in the affirmative, subject to the following qualification. No offer is fair which does not recognize the prior rights of creditors, as above pointed out; but circumstances may justify an offer of different amounts of the same grade of securities to both creditors and stockholders. Whenever assessments are demanded, they must be adjusted with the purpose of according to the creditor his full right of priority against the corporate assets, so far as possible in the existing circumstances.

In re BUDER et al.
271 U.S. 467
UNITED STATES
v.
RAMSEY et al.
Argued April 22, 1926.
1
The defendants in error, two white men, were charged, by an indictment returned in the court below, with the murder of one Henry Roan, a full-blood Osage Indian and a legal member of the Osage Tribe, committed 'in Osage county, in said district, in the Indian country, and in and upon the reservation theretofore and then established by law of the United States for the Osage Tribe of Indians, on and in a certain tract of land therein which was then and there under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States and comprised a restricted surplus allotment, theretofore made under and according to the Act of Congress approved June 28, 1906, * * * the title to which said allotment * * * was held in trust by the United States and was inalienable' by the allottee, who had never had issued to her a certificate of competency authorizing her to sell the allotment. The indictment is drawn under section Rev. St. (Comp. St. § , which extends the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of crimes committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, to the Indian country, with certain exceptions not material here. The court below sustained a demurrer to this indictment upon the ground that the allotment described in the indictment as the locus of the crime was not Indian country within the meaning of section Thereupon, the construction of the statute upon which the indictment is drawn being involved, the case was brought here on writ of error under the Criminal Appeals Act of March (Comp. St. § .
1
2
The authority of the United States under section to punish crimes occurring within the state of Oklahoma, not committed by or against Indians, was ended by the grant of statehood. United States v. McBratney, Draper v. United States, L. Ed. But authority in respect of crimes committed by or against Indians continued after the admission of the state as it was before (Donnelly v. United States, L. Ed. , in virtue of the long-settled rule that such Indians are wards of the nation, in respect of whom there is devolved upon the federal government 'the duty of protection and with the power' (United States v. Kagama, L. Ed. The guardianship of the United States over the Osage Indians has not been abandoned; they are still the wards of the nation (United States v. Osage County, L. Ed. United States v. Nice, L. Ed. ; and it rests with Congress alone to determine when that relationship shall cease (Matter of Heff, L. Ed. United States v. Celestine. 
2
3
The sole question for our determination, therefore, is whether the place of the crime is Indian country within the meaning of section The place is a tract of land constituting an Indian allotment, carved out of the Osage Indian reservation and conveyed in fee to the allottee named in the indictment, subject to a restriction against alienation for a period of 25 years. That period has not elapsed, nor has the allottee ever received a certificate of competency authorizing her to sell. As pointed out in Unitted States v. Bowling, L. Ed. there are two modes by which Indians are prevented from improvidently disposing of their allotments. One is by means of a certificate, called a trust patent, by the terms of which the government holds the land for a period of years in trust for the allottee with an agreement to convey at the end of the trust period. The other mode is to issue a patent conveying to the allottee the land in fee, but prohibiting its alienation for a stated period. Both have the same effect, so far as the power of alienation is concerned, but one is commonly called a trust allotment, and the other a restricted allotment. The judgment of the court below turns upon this narrow difference.
3
4
In United States v. Pelican, L. Ed. a case involving the murder of an Indian upon a trust allotment, this court held (page ) that trust allotments retain 'during the trust period a distinctively Indian character, being devoted to Indian occupancy under the limitations imposed by federal legislation,' and that they are embraced within the term 'Indian country' as used in section But the opinion makes it clear that the difference between a trust allotment and a restricted allotment, so far as that difference may affect the status of the allotment as Indian country, was not regarded as important. The court said: 'The explicit provision in the act of as to allotments,1 we do not regard as pointing a distinction, but rather as emphasizing the intent of Congress in carrying out its policy with respect to allotments in severalty, where these have been accompanied with restrictions upon alienation or provision for trusteeship on the part of the government. * * * The allottees were permitted to enjoy a more secure tenure, and provision was made for their ultimate ownership without restrictions. But, meanwhile, the lands remained Indian lands, set apart for Indians under governmental care, and we are unable to find ground for the conclusion that they became other than Indian country through the distribution into separate holdings, the government retaining control.'
4
5
The essential identity of the two kinds of allotments-so far as the question here under consideration may be affected-was recognized in the Bowling Case, where it was said (page ) that in one class as much as the other 'the United States possess a supervisory control over the land and may take appropriate measures to make sure that in inures to the sole use and benefit of the allottee and his heirs throughout the original or any extended period of restriction.' In practical effect, the control of Congress, until the expiration of the trust or the restricted period, is the same.
5
6
Since Congress possesses the broad power of legislating for the protection of the Indians wherever they may be within the territory of the United States, the question presented is not one of power but wholly one of statutory construction. Viewed from that premise, it would be quite unreasonable to attribute to Congress an intention to extend the protection of the criminal law to an Indian upon a trust allotment and withhold it from one upon a restricted allotment, and we find nothing in the nature of the subject-matter or in the words of the statute which would justify us in applying the term 'Indian country' to one and not to the other.
6
7
It follows that the judgment sustaining the demurrer to the indictment is erroneous, and must be reversed.
7

1
This refers to chapter (Comp. St. § , an act to prohibit the sale of intoxicating drinks to Indians. It provides that the term 'Indian country' shall 'include any Indian allotment while the title to the same shall be held in trust by the government, or while the same shall remain inalienable by the allottee without the consent of the United States. * * *'

CHICAGO, M. & ST. P. RY. CO.
v.
COOGAN.
Argued April 26, 1926.
1
Petitioner is an interstate carrier by railroad. William Coogan came to his death at Farmington, Minn., July 14, 1923, while employed as a brakeman on one of its interstate trains. Respondent brought this action in the district court of Dakota county in that state under the federal Employers' Liability Act, approved April (Comp. St. §§ 8657-8665)), to recover damages for the benefit of the widow and children of the deceased. At the close of all the evidence, petitioner moved the court to direct a verdict in its favor on the ground, among others, that respondent had failed to prove any actionable negligence on the part of petitioner, and that any verdict for respondent would be based upon speculation and conjecture. The motion was denied, and there was a verdict for respondent. A motion for judgment in favor of petitioner notwithstanding the verdict was overruled. Judgment for respondent was given by the trial court, and, on appeal, it was affirmed in the highest court of the state. The case is here on writ of certiorari. Section Judicial Code (Comp. St. § .
1
2
Petitioner contends that the evidence is not sufficient to sustain a finding that any negligence on its part caused or contributed to cause the death. By the federal Employes' Liability Act, Congress took possession of the field of employers' liability to employees in interstate transportation by rail, and all state laws upon that subject were superseded. Second Employers' Liability Cases, L. Ed. Seaboard Air Line v. Horton, L. Ed. Ann. Cas. The rights and obligations of the petitioner depend upon that act and applicable principles of common law as interpreted by the federal courts. The employer is liable for injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence specified in the act and proof of such negligence is essential to recovery. The kind or amount of evidence required to establish it is not subject to the control of the several states. This court will examine the record, and if it is found that, as a matter of law, the evidence is not sufficient to sustain a finding that the carrier's negligence was a cause of the death, judgment against the carrier will be reversed. St. L., Iron M. & S. Ry. v. McWhirter, L. Ed. New Orleans & N. E. R. R. Co. v. Harris, L. Ed. New Orleans & N. E. R. R. Co. v. Scarlet, L. Ed. 
2
3
Petitioner's train 92 was made up at the Farmington yard by a switch crew shortly after 7 o'clock in the morning. Deceased was the rear brakeman of the road crew which was to take the train to Austin. He was killed before the train was ready to start. There was no eyewitness, and the case depends on circumstantial evidence. The tracks in the yard run east and west. The most northerly is the main line track, and, commencing with that one, the others are numbered consecutively 1, 2, 3, etc. Cars were taken from other tracks and put upon track 1 to make up the train. The caboose was kicked-that is detached from the engine in motion and sent by momentum-east to a place where it was stopped by deceased, who road and controlled it by hand brake. Two cars were in like manner put upon that track. They were controlled by a brakeman of the switch crew at the hand brake on the east car, which coupled automatically to the caboose. Deceased was then standing on the ground beside the caboose. That was the last time he was seen before the accident. Similarly nine or ten more cars were sent east on track 1, and under control of the same brakeman were coupled to the others. And then three or four cars-making up all that were to go in the train-were moved east on that track attached to the engine until they came into contact with the cars already there. Then the engine was stopped to discover whether the coupling made. It was found that it had, and, in order to clear the switch, the engine moved all the cars east about two car lengths-66 to 80 feet. Then the switch engine was detached. Immediately the road engine came and was coupled to the cars. The air hose was coupled between the engine and the first car. But it was found that the air line was open at some other place. The brakeman of the switch crew walked east along the south side of the train and coupled the hose at the east end of the last cut that was set in. After that, and while going toward the rear he found the body of deceased. It was near the west end of the second car from the caboose, and was lying parallel with the track, outside the south rail and on or at the ends of the ties. There were indications on the ground sufficient to show that he had been between the rails of the track, that he had been run over by the east truck of the car next to the caboose, that his left leg and left arm had been crushed between wheel and rail, and that his body had been dragged about 15 feet. There was evidence to support respondent's contention that it was the duty of deceased to couple the air hose, and that prior to the accident all couplings had been made, except that made by the brakeman of the switch crew and the one at the caboose.
3
4
The breach of duty relied on is this: About 12 inches south of the south rail of the track, and fastened to the ties by clamps and spikes, there was an air pipe line extending about feet. It was installed three or four years before the accident. At the time of the accident, a stretch of the pipe line about 15 feet in length had been loosened and bent 3 or 4 inches toward the rail and upward leaving a space of from 3 1/2 to 4 inches between it and the ties. It had been in that condition for some months. The evidence is sufficient to warrant a finding that there was a breach of duty in this respect. But the precise question for decision is whether the condition of the pipe caused or contributed to cause the death of deceased. The east end of the part so loosened and bent was about 15 feet west of the place where the body of deceased was found. Respondent argues that a brakeman, going in from the south side to couple the hose between the caboose and rear car, naturally would step inside the south rail with his right foot, leaving his left foot between the rail and the air pipe line. As to that the evidence is in conflict, but it will be taken to be sufficient to sustain the contention. The shoes worn by deceased at the time of the accident were received in evidence. The outside of the counter of the left shoe was scratched, and showed a marked rounding depression parallel with the sole and just above the heel. This condition was first noticed some days after the accident. In the meantime the shoes had been left in a garage and no attention was given to them. The depression in the counter was not so clear at the trial as when first noticed. The foregoing indicates the substance of all the evidence bearing on the cause of death.
4
5
The case was tried, and respondent supports the judgment, on the theory that, when the switch engine stopped after the last coupling, deceased went between the caboose and car to couple the air hose; that he stepped between the rails with his right foot, leaving his left foot outside the south rail and between it and the pipe line; that, stooping to reach the air hose his left foot slipped back ward under the bent pipe; that, before he had time to make the coupling, the cars were started backward in the movement to clear the switch; that, when he attempted to straighten up, his left foot was caught under the pipe, and he was forced backward, run over, and killed. It follows that, unless the evidence is sufficient to warrant a finding that the death resulted from the catching of deceased's left foot under the bent part of the pipe line the judgment cannot be sustained. As there is no direct evidence, it is necessary to determine whether the circumstances are sufficient to warrant a finding of that fact. Whenever circumstantial evidence is relied on to prove a fact, the circumstances must be proved and not themselves presumed United States v. Ross, Manning v. Insurance Co., Assuming it was the duty of deceased to couple the air hose, it was necessary for him to go between the cars to do so. He was standing by the caboose when the first cut came in. The air hose coupling might have been made then or at any time after that. It was not made, and it is left to be inferred that he postponed effort in that direction until after all the switching had been done and until the engine had hold of the string of cars. And then it must be inferred that he went between the cars in the manner claimed-his right foot between the rails, leaving his left foot outside, where, it is argued, it was caught under the bent pipe.
5
6
The 'rounding depression' on the counter of the shoe is not sufficient to bridge the hiatus in the evidence. It is not shown when or how that depression was made. The condition of the shoe before the accident is not disclosed. A number of days elapsed before it was noticed, and it is not shown that in the meantime care was taken to keep it in the same condition or that the depression was not made after the accident. Even if the appearance of the shoe and other circumstances are sufficient to justify an inference that the depression might have been made by the bent pipe, it cannot be said that they constitute any reasonable support for a finding that it was so made. And, assuming that the depression on the shoe counter was made by contact with the bent pipe, there is nothing to indicate whether it was made at the time deceased was knocked down, or later while he was being dragged. But there is nothing to show that the pipe had any connection with the accident. The fact that deceased was run over and killed at the time and place disclosed has no tendency to show that his foot was caught. One between cars coupling the air hose is very liable to be run over, if the train is unexpectedly moved. A finding that his foot was not caught under the pipe is quite as consistent with the evidence as a finding that it was.
6
7
It is the duty of the trial judge to direct a verdict for one of the parties when the testimony and all the inferences which the jury reasonably may draw therefrom would be insufficient to support a different finding. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Groeger, L. Ed. When the evidence and the conclusions which a jury might fairly draw from the evidence are taken most strongly against the petitioner the contention of respondent that the bent pipe caused or contributed to cause the death is without any substantial support. The record leaves the matter in the realm of speculation and conjecture. That is not enough. Pawling v. United States, L. Ed. 601; Patton v. Texas & Pacific Railway Co., L. Ed. Looney v. Metropolitan Railroad Co., L. Ed. St. L. & Iron Mtn. Ry. Co. v. McWhirter, supra; St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. v. Mills, L. Ed. decided May 24, 1926.

MA-KING PRODUCTS CO.
v.
BLAIR, Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
Argued May 7, 1926.
1
This is a suit in equity brought by the Ma-King Products Company, a corporation, in the Federal District Court for Western Pennsylvania, against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The bill alleged that the Company had duly made application to the Commissioner, in accordance with the National Prohibition Act1 and regulations, and accompanied by a proper bond, for a permit to operate a plant for denaturing alcohol; and that, while under the law the Commissioner was authorized to grant such a permit, he had 'arbitrarily, illegally and without any reason or warrant in law or in fact' disapproved the application and refused to issue the permit. The prayer was that the court review the Commissioner's action, reverse his findings as to fact and law, and direct him to approve the application and grant the permit.
1
2
The Commissioner answered, denying that he had acted arbitrarily and illegally in disapproving the Company's application; and, alleging that, as the result of an investigation conducted by his agents, he was informed that the president and secretary-treasurer of the Company were not individually, or as its officers, 'entitled to be entrusted with a permit of the nature and kind set forth in the application,' under the provisions of the Act; and that, upon this information, he 'acted under full warrant of law and fact' in disapproving the application and refusing to issue the permit.
2
3
After a hearing before two District Judges, at which evidence was introduced by both sides, the judges concurred in the opinion that there was nothing in the record which would justify the court in finding that the Commissioner in refusing the application for the permit had 'abused the wide discretion invested in him by the Act of Congress,' and that the bill should therefore be dismissed; and a decree was entered accordingly. This was affirmed, on appeal, by the Circuit Court of Appeals, which said that:
3
4
'After an examination of the proofs in the case we are of the opinion the associations and business connections of * * * the principal officers of this company, were such that the Commissioner had ample ground for declining to issue the company the permit. The holder of such a permit is entrusted by the goverment with a power which subjects him to the approaches and bribes of law breakers, and where, as in this case, the business associations of applicants have been with men whose conduct has already invited prohibition prosecutions against them, it goes without saying that the Commissioner would have been derelict in duty in granting them a permit.' .
4
5
This appeal was allowed in March, 1925.
5
6
Titile 2 of the Prohibition Act provides that 'all the provisions of this Act shall be liberally construed to the end that the use of intoxicating liquor as a beverage may be prevented'; that, with certain exceptions not here material, no one 'shall manufacture, sell, purchase, transport, or prescribe any liquor without first obtaining a permit from the commissioner so to do'; that no permit shall be issued to any person who within one year prior to the application therefor shall have violated the terms of any permit or any Federal or State law regulating traffic in liquors; that no permit shall be issued 'until a verified, written application shall have been made therefor, setting forth the qualification of the applicant and the purpose for which the liquor is to be used'; that the commissioner 'may prescribe the form of all permits and applications and the facts to be set forth therein,' and before any permit is granted 'may require a bond in such form and amount as he may prescribe to insure compliance with the terms of the permit and the provisions of' the title; and that if the Commissioner refuses any application for a permit, the applicant 'may have a review of the decision by a court of equity,' which may affirm, modify or reverse' his finding 'as the facts and law of the case may warrant.'2
6
7
It is clear that the Act does not impose on the Commissioner the mere ministerial duty of issuing a permit to any one making an application on the prescribed form, but, on the contrary, places upon him, as the administrative officer directly charged with the enforcement of the law, a responsibility in the matter of granting the privilege of dealing in liquor for nonbeverage purposes, which requires him to refuse a permit to one who is not a suitable person to be entrusted, in a relation of such confidence, with the possession, of liquor susceptible of division to beverage uses.
7
8
The dominant purpose of the Act is to prevent the use of intoxicating liquor as a beverage, and all its provisions are to be liberally construed to that end. It does not provide that the Commissioner shall issue any liquor permit, but merely that he may do so. It specifically requires the application to show 'the qualification of the applicant,' and authorizes the Commissioner to prescribe, 'the facts to be set forth therein.' These provisions, as well as the purpose of the Act, are entirely inconsistent with any intention on the part of Congress that the Commissioner should perform the merely perfunctory duty of granting a permit, to any and every applicant, without reference to his qualification and fitness; and they necessarily imply that, in order to prevent violations of the Act he shall, before granting a permit, determine, in the exercise of his sound discretion, whether the applicant is a fit person to be entrusted with such a privilege. This is emphasized by the provision that if the Commissioner refuses an application, his action may be reviewed by a court of equity in matter of fact and law; there being no substantial reason for this provision if he is imperatively required to grant a permit upon the mere presentation of an application in due form.
8
9
On the other hand, it is clear that Congress in providing that an adverse decision of the Commissioner might be reviewed in a court of equity, did not undertake to vest in the court the administrative function of determining whether or not the permit should be granted; but that this provision is to be construed, in the light of the well-established rule in analogous cases, as merely giving the court authority to determine whether, upon the facts and law, the action of the Commissioner is based upon an error of law, or is wholly unsupported by the evidence or clearly arbitrary or capricious. See Silberschein v. United States, and cases cited.
9
10
Here, plainly, the refusal of the permit involved no error of law. And the two courts below have, in effect, concurred in finding, upon the entire evidence, that there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the Commissioner; the Circuit Court of Appeals specifically finding that the associations and business connections of the principal officers of the company were such that he had ample ground for declining to issue the permit. An examination of the evidence-which need not be recited here discloses no clear error which would authorize us to set aside this concurrent finding. United States v. State Investment Co., L. Ed.

271 U.S. 484
DAVIS et al.
v.
WILLIFORD et al.
Submitted May 4, 1926.
1
This case involves a single question relating to the construction and effect of section 23 of the Act of April dealing with the Five Civilized Tribes. This reads:
1
2
'Every person of lawful age and sound mind may by last will and testament devise and bequeath all of his estate, real and personal, and all interest therein: Provided, That no will of a full-blood Indian devising real estate shall be valid, if such last will and testament disinherits the parent, wife, spouse, or children of such full-blood Indian, unless acknowledged before and approved by a judge of the United States court of the Indian Territory, or a United States commissioner.'
2
3
The subject-matter of the controversy-which arose in the course of a proceeding instituted in a local court of Oklahoma to foreclose a mortgage-is a part of a surplus allotment of acres out of tribal lands made in 1904 to Frazier McLish, a full-blood Chickasaw Indian and held by him subject to restrictions against alienation. In July, 1906, he executed a will by which he bequeathed one dollar to his wife and each of his children, and devised all the residue of his property, including this allotment, to his sister. In McLish having died, the will was probated and recorded, the only endorsement which it bore being the following:
3
4
'Approved by me July 9, 1906. Thomas N. Robnett, U. S. Commissioner for the Southern District, Indian Territory, First Commissioner's District, in accordance with the Act of Congress of April 26, 1906. (Seal).'
4
5
For present purposes it suffices to say that the proceeding in the District Court involved a controversy as to the title to part of this allotment, arising between J. A. White, to whom it had been conveyed by the devisee, and S. H. Davis, to whom White had given a mortgage, on the one side; and the widow and children of the testator, on the other side. White and Davis claimed that the will was valid and had passed title to the devisee; and the widow and children claimed that it was invalid, since it had not been acknowledged before a commissioner or judge as required by the Act of and that the title to the allotment had descended to them.
5
6
On the trial the United States Commissioner testified that at the time he approved the will the testator had appeared before him and acknowledged its execution for the purposes therein mentioned, but that, by inadvertence, the certificate of such acknowledgment had been omitted. The court, in view of this evidence, held that as the will had been in fact acknowledged before the Commissioner, it was valid and vested title to the allotment in the devisee; and gave judgment accordingly. On appeal, this was reversed by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, which held that parol testimony was inadmissible to supply the lack of a certificate of acknowledgment, and that under the Act of the will was invalid. 
6
7
The case is now before us on a writ of error, which was allowed in March, 1925, and a petition for a writ of certiorari, which was postponed to the hearing on the merits. The writ of error must be dismissed under the Jurisdictional Act of ; and the writ of certiorari is granted.
7
8
Davis and White do not deny that the will disinherited the testator's wife and children, Re Byford's Will, and that it was invalid unless acknowledged before the Commissioner, as well as approved by him. Their contention is, that under a proper construction of section 23 of the Act of where a full-blood Indian who devises his lands to the exclusion of his wife and children, appears before a Commissioner and acknowledges the document presented to be his will, 'it is the fact of such acknowledgment by said testator, and not any certificate by the officer, which gives validity to the will'; and they expressly concede that 'if, on the other hand, Congress intended to require that a certificate of acknowledgment be placed on the will itself by the officer,' they cannot prevail.
8
9
Construing section 23 of the Act in the light of its manifest purpose, we think that Congress intended that to give validity to such a will it was necessary not only that it be in fact acknowledged by the testator before the officer, but that the officer place a certificate of such acknowledgment upon the will, as an essential part of the acknowledgment itself.
9
10
Prior to the Act of Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes had no power to dispose of their restricted lands by will. Taylor v. Parker, Blundell v. Wallace, L. Ed. And in giving them generally such power by section 23 of the Act, it was specifically provided that no will of a full-blood Indian devising real estate and disinheriting his parent, spouse or children, should be valid 'unless acknowledged before and approved by a judge of a United States court * * * or United States Commissioner.'
10
11
It is clear that it was intended by this proviso to prevent a full-blood Indian from being overreached and imposed upon, and induced for an inadequate consideration or by trickery, to deprive his heirs of their inheritance; and that, to this end, a will devising his land to other persons should not be valid unless acknowledged before and approved by a judicial or quasi-judicial officer of the United States. To make certain of this, the officer was not to approve the will unless the testator appeared before him in person and acknowledged its due execution, and, upon the examination of the testator, the will appeared to be of such a character and based upon wuch consideration as to warrant its approval. Plainly, it was not intended that such acknowledgment and approval should be a perfunctory matter. And as the will when probated and recorded would be a muniment of title to the land, necessarily a certificate both of the acknowledgment and the approval should appear upon it. We cannot think that Congress intended that in a matter of this solemnity and importance, involving the recorded title to land, the effect of a will, which when probated and recorded bore no certificate of the acknowledgment or approval essential to its validity, should thereafter rest in parol, subject to all the uncertainty that would follow if its validity could be established-when the lips of the testator were closed-by parol evidence as to the fact of acknowledgment or approval. This would destroy the certainty which is essential in muniments of title appearing upon the public records. If this were possible, the subsequent establishment of the validity of the will would largely depend upon the lapse of time before it was brought into litigation, and the availability, at that time, of evidence to establish or to contradict a claim that it had in fact been acknowledged or approved; and where portions of the land had been conveyed by the devisee to different persons, the result of suits involving the validity of the will, might often depend upon the weight attached by the courts to diverse evidence in different suits, and lead to judgments establishing the validity of the will as to the purchaser of one portion of the land, and its invalidity as against another.
11
12
Clearly, we think, Congress did not contemplate such a disastrous result, but in granting by the Act to a full-blood Indian, under its guardianship, the power to dispose of his restricted land by will, intended that a will disinheriting those to whom his land would otherwise descend, should be valid only when the facts of acknowledgment and approval should both be certified by the officer on the will, and appear upon it when probated and placed of record.
12
13
We conclude here that the will, by reason of the lack of any certificate of acknowledgment, was not 'acknowledged before' the Commissioner within the meaning of the Act, and, being therefore invalid, did not pass title to the allotment to the devisee. The judgment is accordingly
13
14
Affirmed.

271 U.S. 489
CITY OF DOUGLAS
v.
FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF DALLAS.
Argued April 28, 1926.
1
The county of Cochise, Arizona, on December 22, 1920, drew its check on the Central Bank of Willcox, Ariz., in favor of plaintiff in error, hereafter called plaintiff. Plaintiff delivered the check indorsed in blank to the First National Bank of Douglas, Ariz., and that bank credited plaintiff's account and passbook with the amount of the check. The passbook had printed upon its face, 'All out of town items credited subject to final payment.' The Douglas Bank indorsed the check, 'Pay to the order of the El Paso Branch, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.' which will be referred to as defendant, and forwarded it to that bank for collection.
1
2
Defendant forwarded the check, in due time, to the drawee bank at Willcox. The latter debited the drawer's account with the amount of the check, stamped it 'Paid,' later returning it to the drawer, and transmitted to the defendant, in lieu of cash, its own check upon the Central Bank of Phoenix, in an amount covering this and other items. The last check was dishonored; both the Willcox Bank and the Central Bank of Phoenix having failed, the First National Bank of Douglas received no proceeds of the check, and charged back the amount of it to the account of plaintiff.
2
3
Plaintiff brought suit in the District Court for Western Texas to recover the amount of the check, on the ground that defendant was negligent in accepting the check of the Willcox Bank in payment, instead of cash especially because it was chargeable with notice that both the Willcox Bank and the Phoenix Bank were then insolvent. The case was tried without a jury, and resulted in a judgment for defendant (, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (. The case comes here on writ of error. See Judicial Code, § (Comp. St. §§ First (a) being section Comp. St.; Sowell v. Federal Reserve Bank, L. Ed. Plaintiff assigns as error the holding of the Circuit Court of Appeals that defendant was not in such a relationship with plaintiff as to permit plaintiff to recover for the defendant's negligence.
3
4
Both plaintiff and defendant concede that it is the rule of the federal courts that a bank which receives commercial paper for collection is not only bound to use due care itself, but is responsible to its customer for a failure to collect, resulting from the negligence or insolvency of any bank to which it transmits the check for collection. This is the so-called 'New York rule,' which in effect makes the first bank a guarantor of the solvency and diligence of the correspondents which it employs to effect the collection. Exchange Nat. Bank v. Third Nat. Bank, L. Ed. And see Federal Reserve Bank v. Malloy, L. Ed. for a comparison of this rule of liability with the 'Massachusetts rule,' by which the initial bank is liable only for its failure to exercise due care in the selection of an agent to make the collection. Under the Massachusetts rule the agent selected becomes the agent of the owner of the paper, who may maintain an action directly against it for the negligent performance of its undertaking. See Federal Reserve Bank v. Malloy, supra. Compare Bank of Washington v. Triplett, 1 Pet. 25, 7 L. Ed. 37, where the undertaking of the initial bank was to transmit paper for collection.
4
5
From this the defendant argues that, under the rule applied in the federal courts, the First National Bank of Douglas became liable by its contract with plaintiff for the negligence of the defendant; hence that there was no privity of contract between plaintiff and defendant, and no basis for a recovery, even though defendant was negligent in accepting an exchange check from the Willcox Bank. See Federal Reserve Bank v. Malloy, supra. This was the view taken by the Circuit Court of Appeals, but the plaintiff objects that it is not a necessary corollary of the New York rule, applied in Exchange National Bank v. Third Nat. Bank, supra, that one who deposits paper for collection may not proceed against a correspondent, selected by the initial bank for that purpose, for negligent failure to make the collection, and that neither Exchange Nat. Bank v. Third Nat. Bank nor Federal Reserve Bank v. Malloy so held. It objects, also, that in any event the rule is not applicable here, because of the stipulation appearing on the face of the passbook: 'All out of town items credited subject to final payment.'
5
6
It is said that the effect of this language was to relieve the initial bank, the First National Bank of Douglas, from the liability which would otherwise have resulted under the New York rule, and to make it a mere agent to transmit the paper to defendant for collection, and thus to make applicable the Massachusetts rule. See Federal Reserve Bank v. Malloy, supra. In that case, a local statute relieved the bank receiving paper for collection from any liability, except that of due care in selecting a subagent for collection and in transmitting the paper to it, and it was held that the owner of the paper might proceed against the subagent for negligent failure to collect the paper.
6
7
It is not necessary to decide any of these questions here, for when paper is indorsed without restriction by a depositor, and is at once passed to his credit by the bank to which he delivers it, he becomes the creditor of the bank; the bank becomes owner of the paper, and in making the collection is not the agent for the depositor. Burton v. United States, L. Ed. Union Electric Steel Co. v. Imperial Bank (C. C. A.) General Amer. Tank Car Corp. v. Goree (C. C. A.) In re Ruskay (C. C. A.) Scott, Cases on Trusts, p. 64, note, par. 
7
8
Such was the relation here between the plaintiff and the Douglas Bank, unless it was altered by the words printed on the passbook to the effect that out of town items were credited 'subject to final payment.' The meaning of this language, as the cashier of the Douglas Bank testified, and as the court below held, was that, if the check was not paid on presentation, it was to be charged back to plaintiff's account. The check was paid, and the drawer and indorsers discharged. Malloy v. Federal Reserve Bank (D. C.) Federal Reserve Bank v. Malloy, L. Ed. Nineteenth Ward Bank v. Weymouth Bank, Winchester Milling Co. v. Bank of Winchester, L. R. A. (N. S.) Without these words, the relationship between the plaintiff and the bank was that of indorser and indorsee; and their use here did not vary the legal rights and liabilities incident to that relationship, unless it dispensed with notice of dishonor to the depositor. As was said by the court in Burton v. United States, supra, :
8
9
'The testimony * * * as to the custom of the bank, when a check was not paid, of charging it up against the depositor's account, did not in the least vary the legal effect of the transaction; it was simply a method pursued by the bank of exacting payment from the indorser of the check, and nothing more. There was nothing whatever in the evidence showing any agreement or understanding as to the effect of the transaction between the parties-the defendant and the bank-making it other than such as the law would imply from the facts already stated.'
9
10
While there is not entire uniformity of opinion, the weight of authority supports the view that upon the deposit of paper unrestrictedly indorsed, and credit of the amount to the depositor's account, the bank becomes the owner of the paper, notwithstanding a custom or agreement to charge the paper back to the depositor in the event of dishonor. Burton v. United States, supra; Brusegaard v. Ueland, Nat. Bank of Commerce v. Bossemeyer, L. R. A. Walker & Brock v. Ranlett Co., Aebi v. Bank of Evansville, L. R. A. See Scott v. McIntyre Co., Vickers v. Machinery Warehouse & Sales Co., But see Implement Co. v. Bank, Packing Co. v. Davis. 
10
11
Plaintiff having thus surrendered its rights in the paper, only rights arising out of its contract with the initial bank remained. If those rights were affected by the act or omission of defendant, they were affected only because that contract so stipulated. Defendant's duties arose out of its contract with the initial bank, or out of its relation to that bank as owner of the paper. Hence there was no relationship between plaintiff and defendant which could be made the basis of recovery for defendant's want of diligence.
11
12
Judgment affirmed.

271 U.S. 494
RAFFEL
v.
UNITED STATES.
Submitted May 4, 1926.
1
Raffel, with another, was indicted and twice tried for conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. et seq.). Upon the first trial, a prohibition agent testified that after the search of a drinking place, Raffel admitted that the place belonged to him. On that trial Rafel did not offer himself as a witness, and the jury failed to reach a verdict. Upon the second trial the prohibition agent gave similar testimony. Raffel took the stand and denied making any such statement. After admitting that he was present at the former trial, and that the same prosecuting witness had then given the same testimony, Raffel was asked questions by the court which required him to disclose that he had not testified at the first trial, and to explain why he had not done so. The questions and answers are printed in the margin.1 The second trial resulted in a conviction. On writ of error, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit certified to this court (Judicial Code, § ) a question necessary to the disposition of the case as follows:
1
2
'Was it error to require the defendant, Raffel, offering himself as a witness upon the second trial, to disclose that he had not testified as a witness in his own behalf upon the first trial?'
2
3
To this, and to the similar questions which involve, not a previous trial, but a previous preliminary examination, or a hearing upon habeas corpus or application for bail, the authorities have given conflicting answers. Cases which support the government's position are Commonwealth v. Smith, and People v. Prevost, See, also, Taylor v. Commonwealth, Ky. Law Rep. Sanders v. State, S. W. 803. Compare Garrett v. Transit Co., Ann. Cas. 
3
4
Other cases take an opposite view, with perhaps less searching examination of the principles involved. See Parrott v. Commonwealth, Ky. Law Rep. Newman v. Commonwealth, Ky. Law Rep. 81; Smith v. State, Am. St. Rep. Parrott v. State, L. R. A. (N. S.) , Wilson v. State, S. W. 529. And see People v. Prevost, supra. Compare Masterson v. Transit Co., Garrett v. Transit Co., supra.
4
5
The Fifth Amendment provides that a person may not 'be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself' and by the Act of March (Comp. St. § 1465), it is enacted:
5
6
'That in the trial of all indictments * * * against persons charged with the commission of crimes, offenses, and misdemeanors, in the United States courts * * * the person so charged shall, at his own request but not otherwise, be a competent witness. And his failure to make such request shall not create any presumption against him.'
6
7
The immunity from giving testimony is one which the defendant may waive by offering himself as a witness. Reagan v. United States, L. Ed. Fitzpatrick v. United States, L. Ed. Powers v. United States, L. Ed. Caminetti v. United States, L. Ed. Ann. Cas. Gordon v. United States, Austin v. United States (C. C. A.) When he takes the stand in his own behalf, he does so as any other witness, and within the limits of the appropriate rules he may be cross-examined as to the facts in issue. Reagan v. United States, supra; Fitzpatrick v. United States, supra; Tucker v. United States (C. C. A.) He may be examined for the purpose of impeaching his credibility. Reagan v. United States, supra; Fitzpatrick v. United States, supra. His failure to deny or explain evidence of incriminating circumstances of which he may have knowledge may be the basis of adverse inference, and the jury may be so instructed. Caminetti v. United States, supra. His waiver is not partial; having once cast aside the cloak of immunity, he may not resume it at will, whenever cross-examination may be inconvenient or embarrassing.
7
8
If, therefore, the question asked of the defendant were logically relevant, and competent within the scope of the rules of cross-examination they were proper questions, unless there is some reason of policy in the law of evidence which requires their exclusion.
8
9
We may concede, without deciding, that, if the defendant had not taken the stand on the second trial, evidence that he had claimed the same immunity on the first trial would be probative of no fact in issue, and would be inadmissible. See Maloney v. State, Am. St. Rep. Loewenherz v. Merchants' Bank, Ann. Cas. Bunckley v. State, People v. Willett, 92 N. Y. 29; but see People v. Prevost, supra.
9
10
Making this concession, and laying aside for the moment any question whether the defendant, notwithstanding his offering himself as a witness, retained some vestige of his immunity, we do not think the questions asked of him were irrelevant or incompetent; for, if the cross-examination had revealed that the real reason for the defendant's failure to contradict the government's testimony on the first trial was a lack of faith in the truth or probability of his own story, his answers would have a bearing on his credibility and on the truth of his own testimony in chief.
10
11
It is elementary that a witness, who upon direct examination denies making statements relevant to the issue, may be cross-examined with respect to conduct on his part inconsistent with this denial. The value of such testimony, as is always the case with cross-examination, must depend upon the nature of the answers elicited, and their weight is for the jury. But we cannot say that such questions are improper cross-examination, although the trial judge might appropriately instruct the jury that the failure of the defeendant to take the stand in his own behalf is not in itself to be taken as an admission of the truth of the testimony which he did not deny.
11
12
There can be no basis, then, for excluding the testimony objected to, unless it be on the theory that, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, the defendant's immunity should be held to survive his appearance as a witness on the second trial, to the extent, at least, that he may be permitted to preserve silence as to his conduct on the first.
12
13
Whether there should be such a qualification of the rule that the accused waives his privilege completely by becoming a witness must necessarily depend upon the reasons underlying the policy of the immunity, and one's view as to whether it should be extended. The only suggested basis for such a qualification is that the adoption of the rule contended for by the government might operate to bring pressure on the accused to take the stand on the first trial, for fear of the consequences of his silence in the event of a second trial, and might influence the defendant to continue his silence on the second trial, because his first silence may there be made to count against him. See People v. Prevost, supra, Harvard Law Rev. 
13
14
But these refinements are without real substance. We need not close our eyes to the fact that every person accused of crime is under some pressure to testify, lest the jury, despite carefully framed instructions, draw an unfavorable inference from his silence. See State v. Bartlett, State v. Cleaves, When he does take the stand, he is under the same pressure: To testify fully, rather than avail himself of a partial immunity. And the accused at the second trial may well doubt whether the advantage lies with partial silence or with complete silence. Even if, on his first trial, he were to weigh the consequences of his failure to testify then, in the light of what might occur on a second trial, it would require delicate balances to enable him to say that the rule of partial immunity would make his burden less onerous than the rule that he may remain silent, or, at his option, testify fully, explaining his previous silence. We are unable to see that the rule that if he testifies, he must testify fully, adds in any substantial manner to the inescapable embarrassment which the accused must experience in determining whether he shall testify or not.
14
15
The safeguards against self-incrimination are for the benefit of those who do not wish to become witnesses in their own behalf, and not for those who do. There is a sound policy in requiring the accused who offers himself as a witness to do so without reservation, as does any other witness. We can discern nothing in the policy of the law against self-incrimination which would require the extension of immunity to any trial, or to any tribunal, other than that in which the defendant preserves it by refusing to testify.
15
16
The answer to the question certified is 'No.'

Q. Did you go on the stand and contradict anything they said?
A. I did not.
Q. Why didn't you?
A. I did not see enough evidence to convict me.
Defendants object to the questions of the court.
The Court: I am not commenting; I am just asking why he did't.
Defendant excepts.
The Court: That is so?
The Witness: I did not think there was enough evidence to do it.
By Raffel's counsel: Q. The failure to take the stand on the trial was under the advice of counsel, was it not?
A. Yes sir.

YU CONG ENG et al.
v.
TRINIDAD, Collector of Internal Revenue, et al.
Argued April 12, 13, 1926.
1
This case comes here on a writ of certiorari to review a decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands denying an original petition for prohibition against the enforcement by criminal prosecution of Act No. of the Philippine Legislature, known as the Chinese Bookkeeping Act, on the ground of its invalidity. The petitioner, Yu Cong Eng, was charged by information in the court of first instance of Manila, with its violation. He was arrested, his books were seized, and the trial was about to proceed, when he and the other petitioner, Co Liam, on their own behalf, and on behalf of all the other Chinese merchants in the Philippines, filed the petition against the fiscal, or prosecuting attorney of Manila, and the collector of internal revenue engaged in the prosecution, and against the judge presiding.
1
2
By the Code of Civil Procedure of the Philippine Islands, § the Philippine Supreme Court is granted concurrent jurisdiction in prohibition with courts of first instance over inferior tribunals or persons, and original jurisdiction over courts of first instance, when such courts are exercising functions without or in excess of their jurisdiction. It has been held by that court that the question of the validity of a criminal statute must usually be raised by a defendant in the trial court and be carried regularly in review to the Supreme Court. Cadwallader-Gibson Lumber Company v. Del Rosario, 26 Philippine Reports, But in this case, where a new act seriously affected numerous persons and extensive property rights, and was likely to cause a multiplicity of actions, the Supreme Court exercised its discretion to bring the issue of the act's validity promptly before it and decide it in the interest of the orderly administration of justice. The court relied by analogy upon the cases of Ex parte Young, L. Ed. Ann. Cas. Truax v. Raich, L. Ed. Ann. Cas. and Wilson v. New, L. Ed. Ann. Cas. Although objection to the jurisdiction was raised by demurrer to the petition, this is now disclaimed on behalf of the respondents, and both parties ask a decision on the merits. In view of broad powers in prohibition granted to that court under the Island Code, we acquiesce in the desire of the parties.
2
 the validity of which is attacked, was passed by the Philippine Legislature, and approved February 21, 1921. It reads as follows:
3
 An act to provide in what languages account books shall be kept, and to establish penalties for its violation.
4
5
'Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Philippines in Legislature assembled and by the authority of the same:
5
6
'Section 1. It shall be unlawful for any person, company, or partnership or corporation engaged in commerce, industry or any other activity for the purpose of profit in the Philippine Islands, in accordance with existing law, to keep its account books in any language other than English, Spanish or any local dialect.
6
7
'Sec. 2. Any person violating the provisions of this act shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than ten thousand pesos, or by imprisonment for not more than two years, or both.
7
8
'Sec. 3. This act shall take effect on November 1st, nineteen hundred and twenty-one.'
8
9
This was amended as to its date by a subsequent act and it did not take effect until January 1, 1923. Various efforts were made to repeal the act or amend it, but they were defeated.
9
10
The petition, after setting out the prosecution in the court of first instance, and the text of the act, avers that the petitioner Yu Cong Eng is a chinese merchant engaged in the wholesale lumber business in Manila; that he neither reads, writes nor understands the English or Spanish language or any local dialect; that he keeps the books of account of his business in Chinese characters; that by reason of his ignorance of the English and Spanish languages and of all local dialects he is unable to keep his books in any other language than his own; that, even if he should employ a bookkeeper capable of keeping his books in the English or Spanish language, he would have no means of personally revising or ascertaining the contents or correctness of the books thus kept; that the employment of such a bookkeeper, unless he should be a linguist, would entail as a necessary consequence the employment of a translator or interpreter familiar with the Chinese language and the language or dialect in which such books might be kept, in order to enable the petitioner to ascertain by hearsay the contents thereof; that he would be completely at the mercy of such employees, who, if dishonest, might cheat and defraud him of the proceeds of his business, and involve him in criminal or civil liability in its conduct; that under the provisions of the act he is prohibited from even keeping a duplicate set of accounts in his own language, and would, in the event of the enforcement of the law, be compelled to remain in total ignorance of the status of his business; and that the enforcement of the act would drive the petitioner and many other Chinese merchants in the Philippines who do 60 per cent. of the business of the Islands and who are in like circumstance, out of business.
10
11
The petition avers that the other petitioner in this case, Co Liam, is a Chinese person and conducts a small general merchandise business in Manila, commonly known in the Philippines as a Chinese tienda; that he carries a stock of goods of about that his sales taxes amount to from 40 to 60 pesos per quarter; that he neither reads, writes, nor understands the English or Spanish language or any local dialect; that he keeps books of account of his small business in Chinese, the only language known to him, without the assistance of a bookkeeper; that he has been losing money for some time in the operation of his business, but that even in prosperous times his profits could never be sufficient to justify the employment of a Filipino bookkeeper, and that without the opportunity to keep Chinese books, be would be kept completely ignorant of the changing condition of his business, were he compelled to keep his books in English, Spanish, or a local dialect; and that the enforcement of the act would drive him and all the small merchants or tienda keepers in the Islands who are Chinese out of business.
11
12
The petitioners aver that the act, if enforced, will deprive the petitioners, and the Chinese merchants whom they represent, of their liberty and property without due process of law, and deny them the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Philippine Autonomy Act of Congress of August (Comp. St. § .
12
13
An amendment to the petition set up the rights of the petitioners under the treaty now in force between the United States and China, alleging that under it the petitioners are entitled to the same rights, privileges, and immunities as the citizens and subjects of Great Britain and Spain, and that the treaty has the force and effect of a law of Congress, which this law violates.
13
14
An answer was filed by the fiscal, which is a general denial of the averments of the petition as to the effect of the law. He avers that the law is valid and necessary, and is only the exercise of proper legislative power, because the government of the Philippine Islands depends upon the taxes and imposts which it may collect in order to carry out its functions, and the determination of whether the mercantile operations of the merchants are or are not subject to taxation, as well as the fixing of its amount, cannot and ought not to be left to the mercy of those who are to bear it; that due to the inability of the officials of the internal revenue to revise and check up properly the correctness of the books of account which the Chinese merchants keep in their own language, the public treasury loses every year very large sums.
14
15
Evidence was taken on the issues made. A majority of the Supreme Court held that, if the act were construed and enforced literally, it would probably be invalid, but by giving it an interpretation different from the usual meaning of the words employed it could stand. Two of the justices dissented, on the ground that the court had exceeded its powers and by legislation made it a different act.
15
16
There are two tax laws from which a substantial part of the revenue of the Islands is derived. There is a sales tax of 1 1/2 per cent. on the gross sales of businesses and occupations for which a quarterly return is required. Administrative Code, § There is also an income tax. The annual revenue accruing from the sales tax is roughly pesos, and that from the income tax about pesos.
16
17
Another statute is the so-called Code of Commerce, brought over from the Spanish Code, the thirty-third article of which provides that all merchants shall keep a book of inventories and balances, a day book, a ledger, a copy book of telegrams, letters, etc., and such other books as may be required by special laws. Under the provisions of that Code and the internal revenue law, the colector of internal revenue is authorized to require the keeping of daily records of sales, and makes regulations prescribing the manner in which the proper books, invoices and other papers should be kept and entries made therein by the persons subject to the sales tax. R. Administrative Code, § j).
17
18
Chinese merchants are said to have been in the Philippines even before the arrival of the Spaniards in 1520. The Chinese written language is an ancient language, with a literature and with characters quite different from those used in European languages. There are many different native dialects in the Philippines. Forty-three is said to be the number; but there are less than a dozen of these which may be regarded as important-the Tagalog, the Visayan, with two distinct main dialects, the Ilocano, the Bical, the Pampangan, the Ibanag, the Pangasananian, and the Moro. Perhaps from 7 to 10 per cent. of the Filipinos speak Spanish. A great many (how large the percentage one cannot tell) of the younger people in the Islands speak English. It is a polygot situation, and presents many difficulties in government. Comparatively few of the Chinese speak English or Spanish, or the native dialects, with any facility at all, and less are able to write or to read either. But with capacity and persistence in trade, by signs and by a patois, they communicate with the Filipinos and others with whom they do business, making their calculations with the abacus, an instrument for mechanical calculation, and keeping their books in Chinese characters in ink, applied by a brush to strong paper, securely bound. They have a scientific system of double entry bookkeeping.
18
19
There are merchants in the Philippines to whom the bookkeeping law applies. Of these, are Filipinos, who may use their own dialects; are Americans, or British or Spanish subjects; are of other foreign nationalities, most of whom know the Spanish or English language. The remainder, some in number, are Chinese. The aggregate commercial business transacted by these is about 60 per cent. of the total business done by all the merchants in the Islands. The total amount of their sales in 1923 was more than millions of pesos, distributed among wholesale merchants, of whom 50 did a business of pesos each, of each, and each. There were retail merchants, whose annual incomes on the average would not exceed pesos each. In certain revenue statistics were reported by the then collector of internal revenue to the court of first instance in the case of Young v. Rafferty, 33 Philippine Reports, in which the validity of an order by the collector requiring the keeping of certain books by taxpayers in Spanish and English was at issue. The figures given above are based on this report. The report showed that Chinese merchants paid about 60 per cent. of the taxes, but this is now in dispute, and evidence was introduced by the present collector to show that the proportion of taxes paid by them in was much less, and that examination of the books of Chinese taxpayers showed a very considerable loss, probably due to evasion and fraud.
19
20
The evidence of the president of the largest company in the Philippine Islands, an American who has been 21 years in business in the Philippines, as to the business activities of the Chinese, was accepted by the court below as reliable. He says that the Chinese system of distribution covers the Philippine Islands through the medium of middlemen in the principal centers, and then by the small Chinese storekeepers, throughout the Islads, extending even to the remotest barrios or small settlements. The Chinese are the principal distributing factors in the Philippines of imported goods, and the principal gatherers of goods for exportation in the same remote places. He said that if they were driven out of business there would be no other system of distribution available throughout the Islands, for the reason that there are not Filipino merchants sufficiently numerous, with resources and experience, to provide a substitute.
20
21
The Chinese consul general testified that not more than eight Chinese merchants in the Islands can read or write proficiently in any other language than Chinese, and that the great majority of them could not comply with the act. The merchants' establishments are made up of young Chinese persons, who come from China, begin at the beginning, and are promoted from time to time to become the head of the business. The books are always kept in the Chinese language, and each Chinese establishment is completely separated from the native mode of living.
21
22
Apparently there has always been some complaint in respect to the avoidance of taxes by the Chinese, because of the difficulty of determining what their sales tax should be. There has always been a sales tax in the Philippines. It is a method of taxation to which the people are used. Dr. Pardo de Tavera, the Philippine librarian and historian, testified in this case that efforts to enforce such a law as this in the Spanish times against the Chinese failed and became a dead letter. Governor General Harrison made a general recommendation looking to a law requiring the Chinese to keep books in other than Chinese language, so that their business might be investigated, saying that, until it was done, taxes would be evaded. Since the passage of the law in 1921, as already said, its enforcement has been postponed. Governor General Wood has sought to have the law repealed or changed in such a way that exceptions might be made to it, or that the books of the Chinese should be kept on stamped paper with the pages registered, for the purpose of making it difficult for the Chinese taxpayer to change the records of his business. Protests from the Chinese government, from members of the insular committee of the House of Representatives, from Chambers of Commerce in the United States and elsewhere, were brought to the attention of the Philippine Legislature, and the repeal or modification of the law came up for discussion, but all proposed changes were defeated. The great weight of the evidence sustains the view that the enforcement by criminal punishment of an inhibition against the keeping of any Chinese books of account by Chinese merchants in the Islands would seriously embarrass all of them and would drive out of business a great number.
22
23
Nor is there any doubt that the act as a fiscal measure was chiefly directed against the Chinese merchants. The discussion over its repeal in the Philippine Legislature leaves no doubt on this point. So far as the other merchants in the Islands are concerned, its results would be negligible and would operate without especial burden on other classes of foreign residents. The Supreme Court in its opinion in this case refers to the act as popularly known as the Chinese Bookkeeping Act.
23
24
Evidence was introduced on behalf of the defendants to show the difficulty of securing competent Chinese bookkeepers who could act as inspectors of Chinese books for the tax collecting authorities, and while the failure of the government to employ a sufficient number was charged to the fact that sufficient salaries were not paid to secure them, it is undoubtedly true that a lack of proper and reliable Chinese accountants presents a real difficulty in the examination of Chinese merchants' books.
24
25
The majority of the Philippine court in its opinion, after quoting a number of authorities showing the duty of a court in determining whether a law is unconstitutional or not, first to give every intendment possible to its validity, and second to reach a reasonable construction by which it may be preserved, said:
25
26
'We come to the last question suggested, a construction of Act No. which allows the court legally to approve it.
26
27
'A literal application of the law would make it unlawful for any Chinese merchant to keep his account books in any language other than English, Spanish, or a local dialect. The petitioners say the law is susceptible of that interpretation. But such interpretation might, and probably would, cause us to hold the law unconstitutional.
27
28
'A second interpretation is that the Chinese merchant, while permitted to keep his books of account in Chinese, must also keep another set of books in either English, Spanish, or a native dialect. The respondents claim the law is susceptible of such construction. It occurs to us, however, that this construction might prove as unsatisfactory as the first. Fraud is possible in any language. As approximation to governmental convenience and an approximation to equality in taxation is the most which may be expected.
28
29
'A third construction, which is permissible in view of the history of the legislation and the wording of the statute, is that the law only intended to require the keeping of such books as were necessary in order to facilitate governmental inspection for tax purposes. It has not escaped our notice that the law does not specify what books shall be kept. It is stated by competent witnesses that a cash book, a journal, and a ledger are indispensable books of account for an efficient system of accounting, and that, in the smaller shops, even simpler entries showing merely the daily records of sales and record of purchases of merchandise would be sufficient. The keeping of records of sales, and possibly further records of purchases, in English, Spanish, or a native dialect, and the filling out of the necessary forms would serve the purpose of the government while not being oppressive. Actually, notations in English, Spanish, or a dialect of all sales in sales books, and of data in other specified forms are insisted upon by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, although as appears from Exhibit 2, it is doubtful if all Chinese merchants have complied with these regulations. The faithful observance of such rules by the Chinese is not far removed from the offer of co-operation oft made for them by the petitioners of the 'translation of the account books' oft mentioned and explained by the respondents.
29
30
'The law, in speaking of any person, company, partnership or corporation, makes use of the expression 'its account books.' Does the phrase 'its account books' mean that all the account books of the person, company, partnership or corporation must be kept exclusively in English, Spanish, or any local dialect? The petitioners argue that the law has this meaning. Or does the phrase 'its account books' mean that the persons, company, partnership, or corporation shall keep duplicate sets of account books, one set in Chinese and the other a translation into English, Spanish or any local dialect? Counsel for the respondents urge this construction of the law upon the court.
30
31
Or does the phrase 'its account books' mean that the person, company, partnership, or corporation must keep such account books as are necessary for taxation purposes? This latter interpretation occurs to us as a reasonable one, and as best safeguarding the rights of the accused.'
31
32
The court in effect concludes that what the Legislature meant to do was to require the keeping of such account books in English, Spanish, or the Filipino dialects as would be reasonably adapted to the needs of the taxing officers in preventing and detecting evasion of taxes, and that this might be determined from the statutes and regulations then in force. What the court really does is to change the law from one which by its plain terms forbids the Chinese merchants to keep their account books in any language except English, Spanish, or the Filipino dialects, and thus forbids them to keep account books in the Chinese, into a law requiring them to keep certain undefined books in the permitted languages. This is to change a penal prohibitive law to a mandatory law of great indefiniteness, to conform to what the court assumes was, or ought to have been, the purpose of the Legislature, and which in the change would avoid a conflict with constitutional restriction.
32
33
It would seem to us, from the history of the legislation and the efforts for its repeal or amendment, that the Philippine Legislature knew the meaning of the words it used, and intended that the act as passed should be prohibitory, and should forbid the Chinese merchants from keeping the account books of their business in Chinese. Had the Legislature intended only what the Supreme Court has construed it to mean, why should it not have amended it accordingly? Apparently the Legislature thought the danger to the revenue was in the secrecy of the Chinese books, and additional books in the permitted languages would not solve the difficulty.
33
34
We fully concede that it is the duty of a court in considering the validity of an act to give it such reasonable construction as can be reached to bring it within the fundamental law. But it is very clear that amendment may not be substituted for construction, and that a court may not exercise legislative functions to save the law from conflict with constitutional limitation.
34
35
One of the strongest reasons for not making this law a nose of wax, to be changed from that which the plain language imports, is the fact that it is a highly penal statute authorizing sentence of one convicted under it to a fine of not more than pesos, or by imprisonment for not more than two years, or both. If we change it to meet the needs suggested by other laws and fiscal regulations and by the supposed general purpose of the legislation, we are creating by construction a vague requirement, and one objectionable in a criminal statute. We are likely thus to trespass on the provision of the Bill of Rights that the accused is entitled to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him, and to violate the principle that a statute which requires the doing of an act so indefinitely described that men must guess at its meaning, violates due process of law. Connally v. Construction Co., (decided January L. Ed. 322; United States v. Cohen Grocery Co., L. Ed. International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, L. Ed. United States v. Reese. 
35
36
The main objection to the construction given to the act by the court below is that in making the act indefinitely mandatory instead of broadly prohibitory it creates a restriction upon its operation to make it valid that is not in any way suggested by its language. In several cases this court has pointed out that such strained construction, in order to make a law conform to a constitutional limitation, cannot be sustained.
36
37
In United States v. Reese, the question for decision arose on a demurrer to an indictment against inspectors of municipal election for refusing to receive and count the vote of a colored man. The power of Congress to forbid such an act was confined under the Fifteenth Amendment to a refusal to receive such a vote from a colored man on account of his race, color, or previous condition of servitude, but the section under which the indictment was brought did not specifically confine the offense to a refusal for such a reason or to such discrimination, although in previous sections of the act there was a general purpose disclosed in the act to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment. The demurrer was sustained on the ground that the section was invalid.
37
38
Chief Justice Waite, in delivering the opinion of the court, said at page :
38
39
'We are therefore directly called upon to decide whether a penal statute enacted by Congress, with its limited powers, which is in general language broad enough to cover wrongful acts without as well as within the constitutional jurisdiction, can be limited by judicial construction so as to make it operate only on that which Congress may rightfully prohibit and punish. For this purpose, we must take these sections of the statute as they are. We are not able to reject a part which is unconstitutional, and retain the remainder, because it is not possible to separate that which is unconstitutional, if there be any such, from that which is not. The proposed effect is not to be attained by striking out or disregarding words that are in the section, but by inserting those that are not now there. Each of the sections must stand as a whole, or fall altogether. The language is plain. There is no room for construction, unless it be as to the effect of the Constitution. The question then to be determined is whether we can introduce words of limitation into a penal statute, so as to make it specific, when, as expressed, it is general only. It would certainly be dangerous if the Legislature could set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained, and who should be set at large. This would, to some extent, substitute the judicial for the legislative department of the government.'
39
40
'To limit this statute in the manner now asked for would be to make a new law, not to enforce an old one. This is no part of our duty.'
40
41
The same principle was laid down, and this language approved by this court in the Trade-Mark Cases, in which, to save the validity of a general statute providing for trade-marks, the court was asked to construe the statute to apply only to trade-marks in interstate commerce. It was held this could not be done. Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for the court, at page 98, said:
41
42
'It has been suggested that, if Congress has power to regulate trade-marks used in commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, these statutes shall be held valid in that class of cases, if no further. To this there are two objections: First, the indictments in these cases do not show that the trade-marks which are wrongfully used were trade-marks used in that kind of commerce; secondly, while it may be true that when one part of a statute is valid and constitutional, and another part is unconstitutional and void, the court may enforce the valid part where they are distinctly separable so that each can stand alone, it is not within the judicial province to give to the words used by Congress a narrower meaning than they are manifestly intended to bear in order that crimes may be punished which are not described in language that brings them within the constitutional power of that body.'
42
43
The case of Butts v. Merchants' & Miners' Transportation Co., L. Ed. concerned the application of the Civil Rights Act of March , to vessels of the United States engaged in the coastwise trade. In the Civil Rights Cases, it was held that the Civil Rights Act of to protect all citizens in their civil and legal rights, and in accordance with the terms of which a defendant was indicted for denying the privileges and accommodations of a theater in a state to a person on account of her color, was unconstitutional because power to enact and enforce such legislation in a state was in the state legislature only. The declaration in the Butts Case was brought to recover penalties for violation of the act against a corporation engaged in the transportation of passengers and freight between Boston, Mass., and Norfolk, Va., and the discrimination occurred on the high seas and in the jurisdiction of the United States, and not within any state. It was contended that the federal Civil Rights Act could, therefore, apply in such a case. The court pointed out the all-inclusive words of the act of Congress and held that they could not be cut down to include only what was strictly within the federal jurisdiction. The court said:
43
44
'Only by reason of the general words indicative of the intended uniformity can it be said that there was a purpose to embrace American vessels upon the high seas, the District of Columbia and the territories. But how can the manifest purpose to establish an uniform law for the entire jurisdiction of the United States be converted into a purpose to create a law for only a small fraction of that jurisdiction? How can the use of general terms denoting an intention to enact a law which should be applicable alike in all places within that jurisdiction be said to indicate a purpose to make a law which should be applicable to a minor part of that jurisdiction and inapplicable to the major part? Besides, it is not to be forgotten that the intended law is both penal and criminal'-citing the case of United States v. Reese, and the Trade-Mark Cases, supra, as well as United States v. Harris, L. Ed. Baldwin v. Franks, L. Ed. James v. Bowman, L. Ed. United States v. Ju Toy, L. Ed. Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. McKendree, L. Ed. Karem v. United States, L. R. A. 
44
45
The effect of the authorities we have quoted is clear to the point that we may not in a criminal statute reduce its generally inclusive terms so as to limit its application to only that class of cases which it was within the power of the Legislature to enact, and thus save the statute from invalidity. What it is proposed to do here is much more radical, for it is to ignore and hold for naught a plain prohibition of the keeping of account books in Chinese and insert in the act an affirmative requirement that account books not definitely determined which are adapted to the needs of the taxing officials be kept in the permitted languages. This is quite beyond the judicial power.
45
46
The suggestion has been made in argument that we should accept the construction put upon a statute of the Philippine Islands by their Supreme Court as we would the construction of a state court in passing upon the federal constitutionality of a state statute. The analogy is not complete. The Philippines are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States government, with complete power of legislation in Congress over them, and when the interpretation of a Philippine statute comes before us for review, we may, if there be need therefor, re-examine it for ourselves as the court of last resort on such a question. It is very true that with respect to questions turning on questions of local law, or those properly affected by custom inherited from the centuries of Spanish control, we defer much to the judgment of the Philippine or Porto Rican courts. Cami v. Central Victoria, Ltd., L. Ed. Diaz v. Gonzales, L. Ed. But on questions of statutory construction, as of the Philippine Code of Procedure adopted by the United States Philippine Commission, this court may exercise an independent judgment. In Philippine Sugar Co. v. Philippine Islands, at page L. Ed. , involving the effect of section of that Code, this court said:
46
47
'It is also urged that, since the construction of section is a matter of purely local concern, we should not disturb the decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands. This court is always disposed to accept the construction which the highest court of a territory or possession has placed upon a local statute. Phoenix Ry. Co. v. Landis, L. Ed. But that disposition may not be yielded to, where the lower court has clearly erred. Carrington v. United States, L. Ed. '
47
48
The question of applying American constitutional limitations to a Philippine or Porto Rican statute, dealing, with the rights of persons living under the government established by the United States, is not a local one, especially when the persons affected are subjects of another sovereignty, with which the United States has made a treaty promising to make every effort to protect their rights. The fundamental law we administer in the Philippine bill of rights was a marked change from that which prevailed in the Islands before we took them over, and is to be enforced in the light of the construction by this court of such limitations as it has recognized them since the foundation of our own government. In its application here, we must determine for ourselves the necessary meaning of a statute officially enacted in English and its conformity with fundamental limitations. We cannot give any other meaning to the Bookkeeping Act than that which its plain language imports, making it a crime for any one in the Philippine Islands engaged in business to keep his account books in Chinese. This brings us to the question whether the law thus construed to mean what it says is invalid.
48
49
The Philippine Bill of Rights, already referred to, provides that:
49
50
'No law shall be enacted in said Islands which shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or deny to any person therein the equal protection of the laws.'
50
51
In Serra v. Mortiga, at page L. Ed. , this court said:
51
52
'It is settled that by virtue of the Bill of Rights, enacted by Congress for the Philippine Islands (, that guaranties equivalent to the due process and equal protection of the law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the twice in jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the substantial guaranties of the Sixth Amendment, exclusive of the right to trial by jury, were extended to the Philippine Islands. It is further settled that the guaranties which Congress has extended to the Philippine Islands are to be interpreted as meaning what the like provisions meant at the time when Congress made them applicable to the Philippine Islands. Kepner v. United States, L. Ed. 
52
53
'For the purpose, therefore, of passing on the errors assigned we must test the correctness of the action of the court below by substantially the same criteria which we would apply to a case arising in the United States and controlled by the bill of rights expressed in the amendments to the Constitution of the United States.'
53
54
In view of the history of the Islands and of the conditions there prevailing, we think the law to be invalid, because it deprives Chinese persons situated as they are, with their extensive and important business long established, of their liberty and property without due process of law, and denies them the equal protection of the laws.
54
55
Of course the Philippine government may make every reasonable requirement of its taxpayers to keep proper records of their business transactions in English or Spanish or Filipino dialect by which an adequate measure of what is due from them in meeting the cost of government can be had. How detailed those records should be we need not now discuss, for it is not before us. But we are clearly of opinion that it is not within the police power of the Philippine Legislature, because it would be oppressive and arbitrary, to prohibit all Chinese merchants from maintaining a set of books in the Chinese language, and in the Chinese characters, and thus prevent them from keeping advised of the status of their business and directing its conduct. As the petitioner, Yu Cong Eng, well said in his examination, the Chinese books of those merchants who know only Chinese and do not know English and Spanish (and they constitute a very large majority of all of them in the Islands,) are their eyes in respect of their business. Without them such merchants would be a prey to all kinds of fraud and without possibility of adopting any safe policy. It would greatly and disastrously curtail their liberty of action, and be oppressive and damaging in the preservation of their property. We agree with the Philippine Supreme Court in thinking that the statute construed as we think it must be construed is invalid.
55
56
In Lawton v. Steele, the court said:
56
57
'To justify the state in thus interposing its authority in behalf of the public, it must appear, first, that the interests of the public generally, as distinguished from those of a particular class, requires such interference; and, second, that the means are reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose, and not unduly oppressive upon individuals. The Legislature may not, under the guise of protecting the public interests, arbitrarily interfere with private business, or impose unusual and unnecessary restrictions upon lawful occupations. In other words, its determination as to what is a proper exercise of its police powers is not final or conclusive, but is subject to the supervision of the courts.'
57
58
In Holden v. Hardy, the court said:
58
59
'The question in each case is whether the legislature has adopted the statute in exercise of a reasonable discretion, or whether its action be a mere excuse for an unjust discrimination, or the oppression or spoliation of a particular class.'
59
60
In the case of Meyer v. Nebraska, L. Ed. this court considered the validity of state legislation making it unlawful to teach a foreign language to children, adopted on the theory that the state had the right to protect children likely to become citizens from study of a particular language, in which they might read and learn doctrine inimical to the Constitution of the United States and to the nation, and forbidding the teachers of the language from pursuing their occupation on this account, and held it invalid. The court said:
60
61
'While this court has not attempted to define with exactness the liberty thus guaranteed, the term has received much consideration and some of the included things have been definitely stated. Without doubt, it denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men. * * * The established doctrine is that this liberty may not be interfered with, under the guise of protecting the public interest, by legislative action which is arbitrary or without reasonable relation to some purpose within the competency of the state to effect. Determination by the Legislature of what constitutes proper exercise of police power is not final or conclusive but is subject to supervision by the courts.'
61
62
The same principle is laid down in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, L. Ed. in Truax v. Raich, L. Ed. Ann. Cas. and in Adams v. Tanner, L. Ed. Ann. Cas. in which this court has held legislative attempts arbitrary and oppressively to interfere with the liberty of the individual in the pursuit of lawful occupations to involve a lack of due process.
62
63
In Adams v. Tanner, supra, an act to restrict the maintenance of employment agencies by forbidding the collection of fees from those seeking work, to avoid the extortion to which such workers were often subjected, was held unconstitutional. The court said at page :
63
64
'Because abuses may, and probably do, grow up in connection with this business, is adequate reason for hedging it about by proper regulations. But this is not enough to justify destruction of one's right to follow a distinctly useful calling in an upright way. Certainly there is no profession, possibly no business, which does not offer peculiar opportunities for reprehensible practices; and as to every one of them, no doubt, some can be found quite ready earnestly to maintain that its suppression would be in the public interest. Skillfully directed agitation might also bring about apparent condemnation of any one of them by the public. Happily for all, the fundamental guaranties of the Constitution cannot be freely submerged if and whenever some ostensible justification is advanced and the police power invoked.'
64
65
In Truax v. Raich, supra, the people of the state of Arizona adopted an act, entitled 'An act to protect the citizens of the United States in their employment against noncitizens of the United States,' and provided that an employer of more than five workers at any one time in that state should not employ less than 80 per cent. qualified electors or native-born citizens, and that any employer who did so should be subject upon conviction to the payment of a fine and imprisonment. It was held that such a law denied aliens an opportunity of earning a livelihood and deprived them of their liberty without due process of law, and denied them the equal protection of the laws. As against the Chinese merchants of the Philippines, we think the present law which deprives them of something indispensable to the carrying on of their business, and is obviously intended chiefly to affect them as distinguished from the rest of the community, is a denial to them of the equal protection of the laws.
65
66
We hold the law in question to be invalid.
66
67
Judgment reversed.

271 U.S. 528
ALEJANDRINO
v.
QUEZON et al.
Submitted May 4, 1926.
1
This cause was brought here by certiorari under section 5 of the Act of September 6, 1916, to amend Judicial Code, c. (Comp. St. § ). That act repealed section of the Judicial Code, re-enacted by section 27 of the so-called Philippine Autonomy Act, c. (Comp. St. § ), which gave jurisdiction to this court to examine by writ of error the final judgments and decrees of the Supreme Court of the Islands in all cases in which the Constitution or any statute, treaty, title or privilege of the United States was involved, or in causes in which the value in controversy exceeded $ and a review of such judgments by writ of certiorari was substituted. The certiorari here was granted because a statute of the United States, to wit, the Autonomy Act, was involved.
1
2
This proceeding was an original action in the Supreme Court of the Philippines, brought by Jose Alejandrino, a Senator appointed by the Governor General, seeking a mandamus and an injunction against the 22 elected members of the Senate, including its president, its secretary, its sergeant at arms, and its paymaster. The occasion for the proceeding was a resolution of the Senate, passed February 5, 1924, and reading as follows:
2
3
'Resolved, that the Honorable Jose Alejandrino, Senator from the Twelfth district, be, and he is hereby, declared guilty of disorderly conduct and flagrant violation of the privileges of the Senate for having treacherously assaulted the Honorable Vicente de Vera, Senator for the Sixth district, on the occasion of certain phrases being uttered by the latter in the course of the debate regarding the credentials of said Mr. Aleiandrino;
3
4
'Resolved, further, that the Honorable Jose Alejandrino be, as he is hereby, deprived of all of his prerogatives, privileges and emoluments as such Senator during one year from the first of January, nineteen hundred and twenty-four;
4
5
'And resolved, lastly, that the said Honorable Jose Alejandrino, being a Senator appointed by the Governor General of these Islands, a copy of this resolution be furnished said Governor General for his information.' The petitioner charged that this resolution was unconstitutional and of no effect and asked a preliminary injunction against the respondents enjoining them from executing the resolution, a judicial declaration that it was null and void, and a final order of mandamus against the respondent ordering them to recognize the rights of the petitioner and his office as Senator, and all of his prerogatives, privileges and emoluments and prohibiting them from carrying the order of suspension into effect. The respondents made a special appearance through the Attorney General and objected on demurrer to the court's jurisdiction. The court held that it was without jurisdiction, sustained the demurrer, and as it did not appear that the petition could be amended so as to state a cause of action, it was dismissed without costs.
5
6
Jose Alejandrino was appointed under the Philippine Autonomy Act by the Governor General as Senator to represent the Twelfth district, a district composed of non-Christian tribes in the northern part of Luzon and the Moros in the department of Mindanao and Sulu. At the time he took his seat in the Senate, another Senator, Vicente de Vera, made a speech on the credentials of Senator Alejandrino, in which he said some things which Alejandrino resented. At night, and after the session of the Senate concluded, and away from the Senate chamber, Alejandrino assaulted de Vera because of his remarks made in the Senate. The resolution complained of was because of this assault.
6
7
By section 12 of the Autonomy Act (Comp. St. § , the general legislative powers in the Philippines, with certain exceptions, are vested in a Legislture consisting of two Houses, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate is composed of 24 members from 12 Senate districts; 22 of them are elected, and one, the Twelfth district, already referred to, has 2 Senators, appointed by the Governor General. By section ), a Senator appointed by the Governor General holds office until removed by the Governor General. Section ) provides that the Senate and House respectively shall be the sole judges of the elections, returns and qualifications of their elective members, and each house may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and with the concurrence of two-thirds expel an elective member. The Senators and Representatives shall receive an annual compensation for their services to be ascertained by law and paid out of the treasury of the Philippine Islands. Senators and Representatives shall in all cases, except treason, felony, and breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective houses and in going to and returning from the same, and for any speech or debate in either house they shall not be questioned in any other place.
7
8
It is argued that as the only power of expulsion given to the Senate is in respect of its elected members, no power is conferred on the Senate to expel a member appointed by the Governor General. It is further argued that the power to suspend is only a less power than the power to expel and of the same character, and therefore that the Senate had no power to suspend an appointed Senator, and therefore that the Senate exceeded its authority in attempting to do so in this resolution, and its action was null.
8
9
We do not think that we can consider this question, for the reason that the period of suspension fixed in the resolution has expired, and, so far as we are advised. Alejandrino is now exercising his functions as a member of the Senate. It is therefore in this court a moot question whether or not he could be suspended in the way in which he was. Equally so is the still more important question whether the Supreme Court of the Philippines had any jurisdiction by extraordinary writ of mandamus or injunction to require the Senate, a part of the Island Legislature, and a separate branch of the government, to rescind its resolution and to readmit Alejandrino to the Senate as an active member.
9
10
It may be suggested, as an objection to our vacating the action of the court below, and directing the dismissal of the petition as having become a moot case, that while the lapse of time has made unnecessary and futile a writ of mandamus to restore Senator Alejandrino to the Island Senate, there still remains a right on his part to the recovery of his emoluments, which were withheld during his suspension, and that we ought to retain the case for the purpose of determining whether he may not have a mandamus for this purpose. We are not advised from his petition what the emoluments of his office during that period would be, except his salary. We infer from the averment of his petition that as the suspension was in part retroactive, he was not paid what was due him during the month of January, 1924. It is difficult for the court to deal with this feature of the case, which is really only a mere incident to the main question made in the petition and considered in the able and extended brief of counsel for the petitioner and the only brief before us. That brief is not in any part of it directed to the subject of emoluments, nor does it refer us to any statute or to the rules of the Senate by which the method of paying Senators' salaries is provided, or in a definite way describe the duties of the officer or officers or committee charged with the ministerial function of paying them. The petition in describing the defendants avers that certain of them being Senators 'are besides members of the committee on accounts of the Senate who approve the payment of the emoluments that Senators are entitled to receive.' Section 7 of the petition is as follows:
10
11
'That the defendants, in the respective capacities in which they are sued, attempt to comply with, execute and carry into effect, or to cause to be complied with, executed and carried into effect, the suspension of the plaintiff depriving him, during the period of one year, of the exercise of his office and of all of his prerogatives, privileges and emoluments as Senator, as said defendant Senators and their president do not recognize the plaintiff's right to exercise such office and prevent him from exercising same, and cause all the officers, employe § and other subordinates of the Senate not to recognize the plaintiff as Senator and to prevent him from exercising his office and enjoying his prerogatives, privileges and emoluments, and the president of the Senate, moreover, gives the necessary orders for the carrying into effect of said order of suspension, and the other defendants Faustino Aguilar and Bernabe Bustamente execute and comply with the orders and restrictions of the Senate and its president in order that the plaintiff may not be recognized as Senator and may not exercise his prerogatives and privileges as such Senator in the Senate building and the defendant Francisco Dayaw, official paymaster of the Senate requires him to refund his emoluments received corresponding to the period that has already elapsed from January 1st of this year and refuses to pay the emoluments to which the plaintiff is entitled.'
11
12
We must assume, in view of the injunction of Congress in the Autonomy Act, that Senators shall receive an annual compensation to be fixed by law, that there is some official or board charged with the executive and ministerial duty of paying the senatorial salaries against whom a Senator entitled might procure a mandamus to compel payment. But the averments of the petition do not set out with sufficient clearness who that official or set of officials may be. Were that set out, the remedy of the Senator would seem to be by mandamus to compel such official in the discharge of his ministerial duty to pay him the salary due, and the presence of the Senate as a party would be unnecessary. Should that official rely upon the resolution of the Senate as a reason for refusing to comply with his duty to pay Senators, the validity of such a defense and the validity of the resolution might become a judicial question affecting the personal right of the complaining Senator properly to be disposed of in such action, but not requiring the presence of the Senate as a party for its adjudication. The right of the petitioner to his salary does not therefore involve the very serious issue raised in this petition as to the power of the Philippine Supreme Court to compel by mandamus one of the two legislative bodies constituting the legislative branch of the government to rescind a resolution adopted by it in asserted lawful discipline of one of its members for disorder and breach of privilege. We think, now that the main question as to the validity of the suspension has become moot, the incidental issue as to the remedy which the suspended Senator may have in recovery of his emoluments if illegally withheld, should properly be tried in a separate proceeding against an executive officer or officers as described. As we are not able to derive from the petition sufficient information upon which properly to afford such a remedy, we must treat the whole cause as moot and act accordingly. This action on our part of course is without prejudice to a suit by Senator Alejandrino against the proper executive officer or committee by way of mandamus or otherwise to obtain payment of the salary which may have been unlawfully withheld from him.
12
13
The case having become moot as respects its main features, and the other feature being incidental and not in itself a proper subject for determination as now presented, further steps looking to an adjudication of the cause can neither be had here nor in the court below. In this situation, we must, following the established practice of this court, vacate the judgment below and remand the cause, with directions to dismiss the petition, without costs to either party. Public Utility Commissioners v. Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas, L. Ed. Brownlow v. Schwartz, L. Ed. and cases cited.

271 U.S. 557
PANAMA R. CO.
v.
VASQUEZ.
Argued January 13, 1926.
1
This was an action by the personal representative of a deceased seaman against the owner of the ship whereon he was serving at the time of his death, to recover damages for the death on the ground that it was caused by the owner's negligence in providing an unfit lighting appliance to be used by him in his work. The right of action was based on section 20 of the Semaen's Act of as amended by section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act of (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. ). A judgment for the plaintiff was affirmed by the highest court of the state, and the defendant brings the case here.
1
2
The sole question presented is whether state courts may entertain such actions, the defendant's contention being that they are cognizable only in the federal District Courts.
2
3
Amended section as heretofore construed, changes the prior maritime law of the United States by giving to seamen injured through the negligence of their employers, and to their personal representatives where the injuries result in death, the rights given to railway employees and their personal representatives by the Employers' Liability Act of and its amendments (Comp. St. §§ . Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, L. Ed. And the procedural provisions therein have been construed-when read in connection with sections 24 (third) and (third) of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. §§ , and in the light of constitutional rules respecting admiralty and maritime jurisdiction-to mean that the new substantive rights may be asserted and enforced either in actions in personam against the employers in courts administering common-law remedies, with a right of trial by jury, or in suits in admiralty in courts administering remedies in admiralty, without trial by jury, but always taking the changed maritime law as the basis and measure of the rights asserted. Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, supra.
3
4
The sections of the Judicial Code just cited, while investing the federal District Courts with jurisdiction 'exclusive of the courts of the several states' of all 'civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,' contain an excepting clause expressly 'saving to suitors in all cases the right to a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it.' This clause is a continuation of a like clause in the Judiciary Act of , and always has been construed as permitting substantive rights under the maritime law to recover money for service rendered, or as damages for tortious injuries, to be asserted and enforced in actions in personam according to the course of the common law. Chelentis v. Luckenbach Steamship Co., L. Ed. Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, supra, pages And it uniformly has been regarded as permitting such actions to be brought in either the federal courts or the state courts, as the possessor of the right may elect. Leon v. Galceran, L. Ed. 74; Schoonmaker v. Gilmore, Chappell v. Bradshaw, L. Ed. Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, L. Ed. Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., L. Ed. 
4
5
In so saying, we must be understood as fully recognizing what often has been held in other cases-that the saving clause does not include suits in rem or other forms of proceeding unknown to the common law. The Moses Taylor, The Hine v. Trevor, Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, L. Ed. Ann. Cas. But an action in personam to recover damages for tort is one of the most familiar of the common-law remedies, and it is such a remedy at law that is contemplated by amended section 20 of the Seamen's Act and invoked in this case.
5
6
The defendant insists that the saving clause refers only to rights recognized by the maritime law as existing in 1789, when the clause first was adopted, and therefore does not include rights brought into the maritime law by subsequent legislative changes. We think the clause has a broader meaning, looks to the future as well as the past, and includes new as well as old rights, if only they are such as readily admit of assertion and enforcement in actions in personam according to the course of the common law. This is the view that was taken in Steamboat Company v. Chase, L. Ed. 369.
6
7
The defendant also points to the provision in amended section 20 saying, 'Jurisdiction in such actions shall be under the court of the district in which the defendant employer resides or in which his principal office is located,' and argues therefrom that Congress has manifested a purpose to restrict the enforcement of the newly given rights to the federal District Courts. The provision is not aptly worded to express that purpose, and taken alone is confusing. We think it falls short of that certainty which naturally would be manifested in making an intended departure from the long-prevailing policy evidenced by the saving clause in the Judiciary Act of and in the two sections of the Judicial Code, and that the more reasonable view is that it is intended to regulate venue and not to deal with jurisdiction as between federal and state courts. Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, supra, pages Re East River Co., L. Ed. Engel v. Davenport, L. Ed. (decided April 12, 1926).
7
8
We well might have rested our decision here on the conclusion reached in Engel v. Davenport, where we said:
8
9
'It is clear that the state courts have jurisdiction concurrently with the federal courts, to enforce the right of action established by the Merchant Marine Act as a part of the maritime law.'
9
10
But out of deference to the elaborate presentation of the question in this case we have stated and dealt with the several points advanced as making for a different conclusion.
10
11
Judgment affirmed.
11

1

1
'Sec. 20. That any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common-law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply; and in case of the death of any seaman as a result of any such personal injury the personal representative of such seaman may maintain an action for damages at law with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States conferring or regulating the right of action for death in the case of railway employees shall be applicable. Jurisdiction in such actions shall be under the court of the district in which the defendant employer resides or in which his principal office is located.'

271 U.S. 632
SCOTT
v.
PAISLEY et al.
Argued April 19 and 20, 1926.
1
This case involves a single question relating to the constitutional validity of section of the Georgia Code of This section, which is set forth in the margin,1 provides, in substance, that in cases where a deed has been executed conveying the legal title to land as security for the payment of a debt2-known in Georgia as a 'security deed'-and the holder of the debt upon default in payment, has reduced it to judgment, and the holder of the legal title to the land makes and places of record a quitclaim conveyance to the debtor, reinvesting him with the legal title to the land, it may thereupon be levied upon and sold in satisfaction of the judgment.
1
2
This suit was brought by Dorothy Scott in a Superior Court of Georgia. The case made by her petition was, in substance, this: In she purchased a tract of land, subject to a security deed which the previous owner had executed to secure a note for borrowed money. Thereafter, the note not being paid at maturity, the holder, the grantee in the security deed, brought suit, without notice to her, against the grantor in the security deed, and after recovering judgment on the note, executed and placed of record a quitclaim deed to the defendant; whereupon the sheriff levied an execution on the land, and, after due advertisement, sold it at public sale in satisfaction of the judgment. The petitioner, while not claiming that there was any defense to the note or any irregularity or mala fides in the proceeding, alleged that the sale was void as against her on the ground that section of the Code, as applied to a case whether the grantor in a security deed conveys his interest in the land to a third person before a suit is brought to reduce the secured debt to judgment, is in conflict with the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, in that it provides that the person thus acquiring the interest of the grantor, may be divested thereof through a proceeding to which he is not a party, without notice or opportunity to be heard and make defense. The petitioner prayed that the sale be hold null and void as against her, and that she be declared the equitable owner of the land, with the right to redeem the legal title by payment of the note.
2
3
The petition was dismissed by the Superior Court, on demurrer; and this judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State, per curiam. The case is here on a writ of error under section of the Judical Code (Comp. St. § .
3
4
The case is in a narrow compass. That, under the Georgia decisions, a sale made under a prior security deed in conformity to the provisions of section divests a purchaser from the grantor of all rights in the land is conceded. The contention that this section is unconstitutional, as applied to such a purchaser, rests, in its last analysis, upon the claim that he is entitled, as a matter of right, in accordance with settled usage and established principles of law, to notice of a proceeding to sell the land under the prior security deed and opportunity to make defense therein. We cannot sustain this contention.
4
5
Here the holder of the secured debt was also the holder of the legal title to the property by which it was secured. In such case at least, section authorizes the holder of the secured debt, by following the procedure outlined by the statute, to bring the property to sale in satisfaction of the debt. Its effect is no more than if it conferred upon the holder of the secured debt a statutory power of sale, which may be treated as equivalent, in so far as the constitutional question is concerned, to an express power of sale in a mortgage or trust deed.
5
6
Plainly the right of one who purchases property subject to a security deed, with a statutory power of sale which must be read into the deed, is no greater than that of one who purchases property subject to a mortgage or trust deed, with a contractual power of sale. The validity of such a contractual power of sale is unquestionable. In Bell Mining Co. v. Butte Bank, this court said:
6
7
'There is nothing in the law of mortgages, nor in the law that covers what are sometimes designated as trust deeds in the nature of mortgages, which prevents the conferring by the grantor or mortgagor in such instrument of the power to sell the premises described therein upon default in payment of the debt secured by it, and if the sale is conducted in accordance with the terms of the power, the title to the premises granted by way of security passes to the purchaser upon its consummation by conveyance.'
7
8
In the absence of a specific provision to that effect, the holder of a mortgage or trust deed with power of sale, is not required to give notice of the exercise of the power to a subsequent purchaser or incumbrancer; and the validity of the sale is not affected by the fact that such notice is not given. McIver v. Smith, Atkinson v. College, Grove v. Loan Co., Am. St. Rep. , hardwicke v. Hamilton, Ostrander v. Hart (N. Y.) And see Watkins v. Booth, and Groff v. Morehouse, In Hardwicke v. Hamilton, supra, the court said that 'the law imposes no duty upon a person holding a prior mortgage or deed of trust to notify one holding a similar subsequent or junior lien or incumbrance upon the same property of his intention to sell the property under his mortgage or deed of trust. All that is required of him is to advertise and sell the property according to the terms of the instrument, and that the sale be conducted in good faith.' And in Watkins v. Booth, supra, the court said that it was the duty of the subsequent liener 'to keep advised as to proceedings in case of the former trust deed.'
8
9
So, a purchaser of land on which there is a prior security deed acquires his interest in the property subject to the right of the holder of the secured debt to exercise the statutory power of sale. There is no established principle of law which entitles such a purchaser to notice of the exercise of this power. And section neither deprives him of property without due process of law nor denies him the equal protection of the laws.
9
10
The judgment is affirmed.

COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS, complainant,
v.
STATE OF NEW YORK et al., defendants.
June 7, 1926
1
Decree.
1
2
This cause coming on to be heard on the bill of complaint, the answers of the several defendants, and upon the pleadings and proofs as well as upon the report of Wade H. Ellis, Esq., the special master appointed by this court to take proofs and make report to this court in this cause, and the arguments of counsel thereupon had; therefore for the purpose of carrying into effect the conclusions of this court as stated in its opinion filed herein April L. Ed. 838), it is now here ordered, adjudged, and decreed, by this court:
2
3
First. That in and by the agreement duly entered into between the commissioners of the state of New York and the commissioners of the commonwealth of Massachusetts relating to the so-called western lands and dated December which agreement is called in this case and generally known as the Treaty of Hartford, and which is recorded in the office of the secretary of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, Volume 1, Treaties and Contracts, page 83, and is also duly recorded in the office of the secretary of state of the state of New York, in Liber 22 of Deeds at page 38, which Treaty of Hartford is referred to in said bill of complaint and in the said answers thereto, the state of New York did not cede nor grant unto the commonwealth of Massachusetts any of the land then under the water of Lake Ontario, and that the right of pre-emption of lands and territory granted to the commonwealth of Massachusetts by the state of New York was not intended by the state of New York nor by the commonwealth of Massachusetts to include any of the bed of Lake Ontario as it then existed, and the commonwealth of Massachusetts in and by the terms in said treaty did thereby cede and release to the state of New York all right and title of said commonwealth of Massachusetts in and to the bed of Lake Ontario as part of the rights appertaining to the sovereignty of the state of New York over the said territory.
3
4
Second. That the commonwealth of Massachusetts in and by its legislative act approved November 21, 1788, in chapter 23 of the Laws and Resolutions of the Session of did duly grant and convey to Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham the lands and premises which are known in this case and generally known as the Phelps and Gorham purchase, bounded by the north boundary line of the state of Pennsylvania, bounded on the east by the meridian line which formed the easterly boundary line of the land, the right of pre-emption to which was ceded to the commonwealth of Massachusetts by the Treaty of Hartford, bounded on the west by a line which it was agreed and enacted as it approaches Lake Ontario running northwardly should be '12 miles distant from the most westward bounds of said Genesee river to the shore of Ontario Lake,' and the north boundary of which, it was so agreed and enacted, should run thence easterly along the shores of said lake to the meridian forming said easterly boundary, and that it was the intention of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, and of said Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham, that in and by the said grant, there should be vested in said Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham title in and to all of the land between the northern boundary of Pennsylvania and the waters of Lake Ontario between the eastern and the western boundary lines of said grant, and that the expression used in said legislative act and grant 'to the shore of Lake Ontario, thence eastwardly along the shores of said lake,' was intended by the parties in said grant to mean to the edge of the water of Lake Ontario, and thence eastwardly along the water line of Lake Ontario, and that the commonwealth of Massachusetts did not intend to and did not retain unto itself and lying within said eastern and western boundaries of said Phelps and Gorham purchase bordering on waters of Lake Ontario and called the shore thereof, and that the plaintiff, the commonwealth of Massachusetts, has no right, title, and interest in or to any of the real estate or premises described in the bill of complaint.
4
5
Whereupon it is now here ordered, adjudged, and decreed by this court that the bill of complaint herein be, and the same hereby is, dismissed, with costs to be paid by the complainant.
5
6
It is further ordered by this court that there be included as costs in this court one-half of the cost of the typewritten copy of the testimony furnished to the special master, and the whole of the clerk's costs in this court.

269 U.S. 514
METCALF & EDDY
v.
MITCHELL. MITCHELL v. METCALF & EDDY.
Argued Nov. 30, 1925.
1
Metcalf & Eddy, the plaintiffs below, were consulting engineers who, either individually or as copartners, were professionally employed to advise states or subdivisions of states with reference to proposed water supply and sewage disposal systems. During the fees received by them for these services were paid over to the firm and became a part of its gross income. Upon this portion of their net income they paid, under protest, the tax assessed on the net income of copartnerships under the War Revenue Act of Act Oct. They then brought suit in the United States District Court for Massachusetts to recover the tax paid on the items in question, on the ground that they were expressly exempted from the tax by the act itself, and on the further ground that Congress had no power under the Constitution to tax the income in question.
1
2
The District Court found that 2 of the items were within the statutory exemption; that the remaining 18 were not exempt from taxation, either by the provisions of the statute or under the Constitution, and entered judgment accordingly. 
2
3
The former collector sued out the writ of error in No. as to the two items on which a recovery was allowed. In No. the writ of error is prosecuted by the plaintiffs below as to the remaining items. Judicial Code, § , before amendment of .
3
4
As the case comes directly from the District Court to this court on a constitutional question, the jurisdiction of this court is not limited to that question alone, but extends to the whole case. Horner v. United States, No. L. Ed. Greene v. Louisville, etc., R. R. Co., L. Ed. , 88.
4
5
All of the items of income were received by the taxpayers as compensation for their services as consulting engineers under contracts with states or municipalities, or water or sewage districts created by state statute. In each case the service was rendered in connection with a particular project for water supply or sewage disposal, and the compensation was paid in some instances on an annual basis, in others on a monthly or daily basis, and in still others on the basis of a gross sum for the whole service.
5
6
The War Revenue Act provided for the assessment of a tax on net income; but section a), being contains a provision for exemption from the tax as follows:
6
7
'This title shall apply to all trades or businesses of whatever description, whether continuously carried on or not, except—
7
8
'(a) In the case of officers and employees under the United States, or any state, territory, or the District of Columbia, or any local subdivision thereof, the compensation or fees received by them as such officers or employees. * * *'
8
9
The court found that the two items of income involved in No. were received by one of the plaintiffs in error as compensation for his services as the incumbent of an office created by statute; in one case as chief engineer of the Kennebec water district, a political subdivision of the state of Maine, and in the other as a member of the board of engineers of the North Shore sanitary district, a political subdivision of the state of Illinois. The collector does not press his writ of error in this case, and we therefore dismiss the writ.
9
10
We think it clear that neither of the plaintiffs in error occupied any official position in any of the undertakings to which their writ of error in No. relates. They took no oath of office; they were free to accept any other concurrent employment; none of their engagements was for work of a permanent or continuous character; some were of brief duration, and some from year to year, others for the duration of the particular work undertaken. Their duties were prescribed by their contracts and it does not appear to what extent, if at all, they were defined or prescribed by statute. We therefore conclude that plaintiffs in error have failed to sustain the burden cast upon them of establishing that they were officers of a state or a subdivision of a state within the exception of section a).
10
11
An office is a public station conferred by the appointment of government. The term embraces the idea of tenure, duration, emolument and duties fixed by law. Where an office is created, the law usually fixes its incidents, including its terms, its duties and its compensation. United States v. Hartwell, L. Ed. 830; Hall v. Wisconsin, The term 'officer' is one inseparably connected with an office; but there was no office of sewage or water supply expert or sanitary engineer, to which either of the plaintiffs was appointed. The contracts with them, although entered into by authority of law and prescribing their duties, could not operate to create an office or give to plaintiffs the status of officers. Hall v. Wisconsin, supra; Auffmordt v. Hedden, L. Ed. There were lacking in each instance the essential elements of a public station, permanent in character, created by law, whose incidents and duties were prescribed by law. See United States v. Maurice, Fed. Cas. No. United States v. Germaine, Adams v. Murphy. 
11
12
Nor do the facts stated in the bill of exceptions establish that the plaintiffs were 'employees' within the meaning of the statute. So far as appears, they were in the position of independent contractors. The record does not reveal to what extent, if at all, their services were subject to the direction or control of the public boards or officers engaging them. In each instance the performance of their contract involved the use of judgment and discretion on their part and they were required to use their best professional skill to bring about the desired result. This permitted to them liberty of action which excludes the idea that control or right of control by the employer which characterizes the relation of employer and employee and differentiates the employee or servant from the independent contractor. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Bond, L. Ed. Standard Oil Co. v. Anderson, L. Ed. And see Casement v. Brown, L. Ed. Singer Mfg. Co. v. Rahn, L. Ed. 
12
13
We pass to the more difficult question whether Congress had the constitutional power to impose the tax in question, and this must be answered by ascertaining whether its effect is such as to bring it within the purview of those decisions holding that the very nature of our constitutional system of dual sovereign governments is such as impliedly to prohibit the federal government from taxing the instrumentalities of a state government, and in a similar manner to limit the power of the states to tax the instrumentalities of the federal government. See, as to federal taxation on state instrumentalities, Collector v. Day, United States v. Railroad Co., Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., L. Ed. Ambrosini v. United States, L. Ed. 49; Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., L. Ed. See, cases holding that the Sixteenth Amendment did not extend the taxing power to any new class of subjects, Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., L. Ed. Ann. Cas. Peck & Co. v. Lowe, L. Ed. Eisner v. Macomber, L. Ed. Evans v. Gore, L. Ed. And, as to state taxation on federal instrumentalities, see McCulloch v. Maryland, L. Ed. 579; Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County, The Banks v. The Mayor, Weston v. City Council of Charleston, Farmers' Bank v. Minnesota, L. Ed. Choctaw, O. & G. R. R. v. Harrison, L. Ed. Indian Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, L. Ed. Gillespie v. Oklahoma, L. Ed. 
13
14
Just what instrumentalities of either a state or the federal government are exempt from taxation by the other cannot be stated in terms of universal application. But this court has repeatedly held that those agencies through which either government immediately and directly exercises its sovereign powers, are immune from the taxing power of the other. Thus the employment of officers who are agents to administer its laws (Collector v. Day; Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County, supra), its obligations sold to raise public funds (Weston v. City Council of Charleston, supra; Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., supra), its investments of public funds in the securities of private corporations, for public purposes (United States v. Railroad Co., supra), surety bonds exacted by it in the exercise of its police power (Ambrosini v. United States, supra), are all so intimately connected with the necessary functions of government, as to fall within the established exemption; and when the instrumentality is of that character, the immunity extends not only to the instrumentality itself but to income derived from it (Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra), and forbids an occupation tax imposed on its use (Choctaw, O. & Gulf R. R. Co. v. Harrison, supra). And see Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County, supra.
14
15
When, however, the question is approached from the other end of the scale, it is apparent that not every person who uses his property or derives a profit, in his dealings with the government, may clothe himself with immunity from taxation on the theory that either he or his property is an instrumentality of government within the meaning of the rule. Thompson v. Pacific Railroad, L. Ed. 792; Railroad Co. v. Peniston, Baltimore Shippbuilding Co. v. Baltimore, L. Ed. Gromer v. Standard Dredging Co., L. Ed. Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Pennsylvania, L. Ed. Choctaw, O. & G. R. R. Co. v. Mackey, L. Ed. 
15
16
As cases arise, lying between the two extremes, it becomes necessary to draw the line which separates those activities having some relation to government, which are nevertheless subject to taxation, from those which are immune. Experience has shown that there is no formula by which that line may be plotted with precision in advance. But recourse may be had to the reason upon which the rule rests, and which must be the guiding principle to control its operation. Its origin was due to the essential requirement of our constitutional system that the federal government must exercise its authority within the territorial limits of the states; and it rests on the conviction that each government in order that it may administer its affairs within its own sphere, must be left free from undue interference by the other. McCulloch v. Maryland, supra; Collector v. Day, supra; Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County, supra.
16
17
In a broad sense, the taxing power of either government, even when exercised in a manner admittedly necessary and proper, unavoidably has some effect upon the other. The burden of federal taxation necessarily sets an economic limit to the practical operation of the taxing power of the states, and vice versa. Taxation by either the state or the federal government affects in some measure the cost of operation of the other.
17

But neither government may destroy the other nor curtail in any substantial manner the exercise of its powers. Hence the limitation upon the taxing power of each, so far as it affects the other, must receive a practical construction which permits both to function with the minimum of interference each with the other; and that limitation cannot be so varied or extended as seriously to impair either the taxing power of the government imposing the tax (South Carolina v. United States, L. Ed. Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., supra, at page ) or the appropriate exercise of the functions of the government affected by it (Railroad Co. v. Peniston, supra, 31).

While it is evident that in one aspect the extent of the exemption must finally depend upon the effect of the tax upon the functions of the government alleged to be effected by it, still the nature of the governmental agencies or the mode of their constitution may not be disregarded in passing on the question of tax exemption; for it is obvious that an agency may be of such a character or so intimately connected with the exercise of a power of the performance of a duty by the one government, that any taxation of it by the other would be such a direct interference with the functions of government itself as to be plainly beyond the taxing power.

It is on this principle that, as we have see, any taxation by one government of the salary of an officer of the other, or the public securities of the other, or an agency created and controlled by the other, exclusively to enable it to perform a governmental function (Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra), is prohibited. But here the tax is imposed on the income of one who is neither an officer nor an employee of government and whose only relation to it is that of contract, under which there is an obligation to furnish service, for practical purposes not unlike a contract to sell and deliver a commodity. The tax is imposed without discrimination upon income whether derived from services rendered to the state or services rendered to private individuals. In such a situation it cannot be said that the tax is imposed upon an agency of government in any technical sense, and the tax itself cannot be deemed to be an interference with government, or an impairment of the efficiency of its agencies in any substantial way. Railroad Co. v. Peniston; Gromer v. Standard Dredging Co.; Baltimore Shipbuilding Co. v. Baltimore; Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Pennsylvania; Choctaw, O. & G. R. R. Co. v. Mackey, supra.

As was said by this court in Baltimore Shipbuilding Co. v. Baltimore, supra (in holding that a state might tax the interest of a corporation in a dry dock which the United States had the right to use under a contract entered into with the corporation):

'It seems to us extravagant to say that an independent private corporation for gain, created by a state, is exempt from state taxation, either in its corporate person, or its property, because it is employed by the United States, even if the work for which it is employed is important and takes much of its time.' Page .

And as was said in Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, in holding valid a state tax on premiums collected by bonding insurance companies on surety bonds required by United States officials:

'But mere contracts between private corporations and the United States do not necessarily render the former essential government agencies and confer freedom from state control.' Page .

These statement we deem to be equally applicable to private citizens engaged in the general practice of a profession or the conduct of a business in the course of which they enter into contracts with government from which they derive a profit. We do not suggest that there may not be interferences with such a contract relationship by means other than taxation which are prohibited. Railroad Co. v. Peniston, supra, at page 36, recognizes that there may. Nor are we to be understood as laying down any rule that taxation might not affect agencies of this character in such a manner as directly to interfere with the functions of government and thus be held to be void. See Railroad v. Peniston, supra, at page 36; Farmers' Bank v. Minnesota, supra, at page Choctaw, O & Gulf Railway Co. v. Harrison, supra, at page .

But we do decide that one who is not an officer or employee of a state, does not establish exemption from federal income tax merely by showing that his income was received as compensation for service rendered under a contract with the state; and when we take the next step necessary to a complete disposition of the question, and inquire into the effect of the particular tax, on the functioning of the state government, we do not find that it impairs in any substantial manner the ability of plaintiffs in error to discharge their obligations to the state or the ability of a state or its subdivisions to procure the services of private individuals to aid them in their undertakings. Cf. Central Pacific Railroad v. California, L. Ed. We therefore conclude that the tax in No. was properly assessed.

 judgment affirmed.
