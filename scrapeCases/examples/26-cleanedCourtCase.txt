120 U.S. 41
COUNTY OF NEMAHA
v.
FRANK.
January 17, 1887.
1
This is an action at law brought by Augustus Frank, a citizen of the state of New York, for the purpose of enforcing the payment of the interest coupons on certain municipal bonds alleged to have been issued by the county of Nemaha, on behalf of Brownville precinct, in said county, to aid in the construction of the Brownville, Fort Kearney & Pacific Railroad, in pursuance of an act of the legislature of the tate of Nebraska. The petition alleges that, by virtue of an act entitled 'An act to enable counties, cities, and precincts to borrow money on their bonds, or to issue bonds to aid in the construction or completion of works of internal improvement in this state, and to legalize bonds already issued for such purposes,' passed on the fifteenth day of February, 1869, the board of commissioners of the county of Nemaha issued the special bonds or written obligations of said Brownville precinct on the twentieth day of August, 1870, to aid in the construction of the Brownville, Fort Kearney & Pacific Railroad, and delivered the same to the company authorized to construct said road; that prior to the issue of said bonds the proposition to issue the same was duly submitted to the voters of said Brownville precinct, in strict accordance with the provisions of the said act of the legislature, and that a large majority voted for said proposition; that during the years the said Brownville precinct, and the board of county commissioners, duly paid the coupons then falling due, by means of a tax levied for that purpose, but for the years they have failed and refused to pay the same, or to levy a tax therefor. The petition also alleges that on or about the twentieth of February, 1871, for a valuable consideration, the bonds and coupons were transferred in good faith to John Fitzgerald, and by him to the plaintiff.
1
2
An answer was filed by Nemaha county, as defendant, containing the following matter:
2
3
'The total amount of the bonds so issued and sold, being one series, under one proposition, amounted to one hundred thousand dollars. The said bonds and coupons were voted upon the following contract and conditions, and none other: At the time of the vote for said bonds certain persons were attempting to organize a railroad corporation under the name of the Brown ville, Fort Kearney & Pacific Railroad Company, the identical same organization named in said bonds, with a capital stock of two million dollars, but were unable to organize it because unable to obtain a payment on said amount of stock of ten per cent, thereof, as required by law, precedent to the right to do business. They considered and treated said series of one hundred thousand in bonds as one one hundred thousand dollar cash subscription all paid up in cash in advance, and also they treated and considered bonds of the city of Brownville, situated within the said precinct of Brownville mentioned in the petition, of the nominal sum of sixty thousand dollars, as sixty thousand dollars cash subscription paid up in cash in advance, all as capital stock of said railroad company, aggregation one hundred and sixty thousand dollars, so considered and treated as cash capital stock paid in. But, by considering the said bonds of the nominal sum of $as one hundred and sixty thousand dollars in money paid in on the capital stock, there was still an insufficient amount paid in to enable the company to do business, there being no cash paid in except on a few private subscriptions, and not exceeding ten thousand dollars; so that, even by treating said bonds as money, there was still a deficiency of thirty thousand dollars of the amount prescribed by law as a condition precedent to the organization of the company for the purpose of transacting any of the business for which it was sought to be organized. Defendant, therefore, denies that said railroad company was ever a corporation with power to transact business or to receive municipal bonds for its aid.
3
4
'Defendant, therefore, avers that neither said precinct nor said county had any power or authority to aid in the organization of said railroad company by subscribing its stock, or in any other manner. Defendant further avers that said pretended railroad company never either filed or recorded its articles of incorporation, if any it ever had, in any county in the state of Nebraska, as by law it was compelled to do prior to its existence § a corporation. In the transactions of issuing said bonds by defendant, and of receiving the same by said pretended railroad company, neither the defendant nor the said company had any power to act, and all the acts therein on both sides are and ever have been ultra vires, and null and void. The proposition submitted to the voters of said precinct as a basis of the right to issue said bonds was a proposition to subscribe by said precinct one hundred thousand dollars in stock and shares in the capital stock of said pretended railroad company, and pay the same in bonds aforesaid. The total assessed valuation of all the property in the said precinct, as shown by the last assessment preceding the issuing of said bonds, was $ and the issue of $in bonds was in excess of the amount allowed by law.' The plaintiff, having filed a reply, afterwards moved the court to strike out from the answer of the defendant all the foregoing matter as immaterial and irrelevant. This motion was sustained by the couft, to which ruling the defendant excepted. Upon the pleadings as thus amended the cause was tried by a jury, who returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, on which judgment was rendered, to reverse which this writ of error has been sued out and prosecuted.
4
5
This ruling of the court striking out this portion of the answer is alleged as error. For the purposes of the argument, we shall assume what is claimed by the plaintiff in error, that the matter stricken out was material and relevant. The defenses intended to be raised by it were that, in two particulars, the bonds in question were void as not having been issued in conformity with law. The sections of the statute of in pursuance of which it is alleged they were issued, are as follows:
5
6
'Section 1. That any county or city in the state of Nebraska is hereby authorized to issue bonds to aid in the construction of any railroad, or any other work of internal improvement, to an amount to be determined by the county commissioners of such county or the city council of such city, not exceeding ten per centum of the assessed valuation of all taxable property in said county or city, provided the county commissioners or city council shall first submit the question of the issuing of such bonds to a vote of the legal voters of said county or city, in the manner provided by chapter nine of the Revised Statutes of the state of Nebraska for submitting to the people of a county the question of borrowing money.'
6
7
'Sec. 7. Any precinct, in any organized county of this state, shall have the privilege of voting to aid works of internal improvement, and be entitled to all the privileges conferred upon counties and cities by the provisions of this act; and in such case the precinct election shall be governed in the same manner as is provided in this act, so far as the same is applicable, and the county commissioners shall issue special bonds for such precinct, and the tax to pay the same shall be levied upon the property within the bounds of such precinct. Such precinct bonds shall be the same as other bonds, but shall contain a statement showing the special nature of such bonds.'
7
8
The averments in that portion of the answer stricken out are, in substance, (1) that the bonds were illegal and void, because not issued to a company authorized by the statute to receive them; and (2) that they were illegal and void because issued in excess of the amount of 10 per centum of the assessed valuation of the taxable property in said precinct. The answer of the defendant, in addition to the matter stricken out, contains the following: 'Defendant has no knowledge as to whether the plaintiff is a bona fide holder of said bonds, or any part thereof, or whether he purchased them before due, or paid any value therefor, or purchased them at all, and therefore, for the purpose of raising the issued and procuring the proof thereon by compulsory process, defendant denies the allegations of the petition on that sub ect, and also denies each and every allegation contained in said petition, except such as it has herein expressly admitted in this answer.'
8
9
This clause in the answer remained, and formed the issue which was tried. It is a general denial of each and every allegation of the petition, as no allegation of the petition was otherwise admitted in the answer. It therefore put the plaintiff upon proof of every fact necessary to constitute the cause of action set out in his petition, and embraced a denial of the legality and validity of the bonds, and the lawfulness of their issue and delivery. It required the plaintiff to show, by competent proof, that he was the owner of the coupons sued on, taken from bonds in fact executed by the defendant, issued in accordance with law, and delivered to a party competent to receive the title. It permitted proof on the part of the defendant of every fact which tended to establish that the bonds were illegal and void. It follows, therefore, that every defense which was open to the defendant under that portion of the answer stricken out was equally open to it under the answer as it stood at the trial. The plaintiff obtained no advantage, and the defendant suffered no detriment, by the ruling of the court requiring that portion of the answer to be stricken out. The action of the court in granting the motion did not, therefore, prejudice the defendant. It does not appear from this record what took place at the trial. There is no bill of exceptions which shows what evidence, if any, the defendant offered, or whether any that he did offer was rejected. For aught that appears, the very matters which he might have offered in evidence, under that portion of the answer stricken out, were in fact offered and received under the pleadings as they stood at the time of the trial.
9
10
It seems also to be objected to the judgment rendered against the county of Nemaha that the coupons sued on are not the obligations of the county. It it is said that the bonds are precinct bonds, issued by the county commissioners of the county, the duty to pay which rests upon the precinct alone; the mode of payment being by means of a tax to be levied by the county commissioners upon the property within the bounds of the precinct. It is therefore argued that no action will lie against the county in respect to these bonds and coupons, except in case of the refusal of the county commissioners to levy the tax when it ought to be levied, when a mandamus is the sole remedy, being the one prescribed by the statute. This question has been set at rest by the previous decisions of this court. Davenport v. Dodge Co., and Blair v. Cuming Co., Sup. Ct. Rep. are decisions upon the very point arising under the same statute.
10
11
There is therefore no error in the record, and the judgment is affirmed.

HAYES
v.
STATE OF MISSOURI.
January 17, 1887.
1
The Revised Statutes of Missouri provide that, in all capital cases, except in cities having a population of over inhabitants, the state shall be allowed eight peremptory challenges to jurors, and in such cities shall be allowed fifteen. Rev. St. Mo. §§ .
1
2
The plaintiff in error, John Hayes, was indicted in the criminal court of St. Louis, a city of over inhabitants, by its grand jury, for the crime of murder in shooting and killing one Mueller, in that city, on the twenty-sixth of August, 1881, and was tried in April, 1882, and convicted of murder in the first degree. A new trial having been obtained from the supreme court of the state, he was again tried in January, 1885, and convicted, as on the first trial, of murder in the first degree. Judgment of death followed. On appeal to the supreme court of the state, the judgment was affirmed, and the case is brought before us on error, upon the single ground that, by the law of Missouri providing that, in capital cases, in cities having a population of over inhabitants, the state shall be allowed fifteen peremptory challenges to jurors, while elsewhere in Missouri the state is allowed in such cases only eight peremptory challenges, the accused is denied the equal protection of the laws enjoined by the fourteenth amendment of the constitution of the United States. When the jurors were summoned for the trial, and before any peremptory challenges were made by the state, the accused moved the court to limit the state's peremptory challenges to eight, objecting to its being allowed more than that number. But the motion was overruled, and the accused excepted. And, on the trial, against his protest and objection, the state challenged peremptorily 15 of the 47 qualified jurors.
2
3
The constitution of Missouri, and, indeed, of every state of the Union, guaranties to all persons accused of a capital offense, or of a felony of lower grade, the right to a trial by an impartial jury, selected from the county or city where the offense is alleged to have been committed; and this implies that the jurors shall be free from all bias for or against the accused. In providing such a body of jurors, the state affords the surest means of protecting the accused against an unjust conviction, and at the same time of enforcing the laws against offenders meriting punishment. To secure such a body numerous legislative directions are necessary, prescribing the class from whom the jurors are to be taken, whether from voters, tax-payers, and freeholders, or from the mass of the population indiscriminately; the number to be summoned from whom the trial jurors are to be selected; the manner in which their selection is to be made; the objections that may be offered to those returned, and how such objections shall be presented, considered, and disposed of; the oath to be administered to those selected; the custody in which they shall be kept during the progress of the trial; the form and presentation of their verdict; and many other particulars. All these, it may be said in general, are matters of legislative discretion. But to prescribe whatever will tend to secure the impartiality of jurors in criminal cases is not only within the competency of the legislature, but is among its highest duties. It is to be remembered that such im artiality requires, not only freedom from any bias against the accused, but also from any prejudice against his prosecution. Between him and the state the scales are to be evenly held.
3
4
Experience has shown that one of the most effective means to free the jurybox from men unfit to be there is the exercise of the peremptory challenge. The public prosecutor may have the strongest reasons to distrust the character of a juror offered, from his habits and associations, and yet find it difficult to formulate and sustain a legal objection to him. In such cases, the peremptory challenge is a protection against his being accepted. The number of such challenges must necessarily depend upon the discretion of the legislature, and may vary according to the condition of different communities, and the difficulties in them of securing intelligent and impartial jurors. The whole matter is under its control. Stokes v. People, Walter v. People, Com. v. Dorsey. 
4
5
Originally, by the common law, the crown could challenge peremptorily without limitation as to number. By act of parliament passed in the time of Edward I., the right to challenge was restricted to challenges for cause. But, by a rule of court, the crown was not obliged to show cause until the whole panel was called. Those not accepted on the call were directed to stand aside. If, when the panel was gone through, a full jury was obtained, it was taken for the trial. If, however, a full jury was not obtained, the crown was required to show cause against the jurors who had been directed to stand aside; and, if no sufficient cause was shown, the jury was completed from them.
5
6
In this country the power of the legislature of a state to prescribe the number of peremptory challenges is limited only by the necessity of having an impartial jury. In our large cities there is such a mixed population, there is such a tendency of the criminal classes to resort to them, and such an unfortunate disposition on the part of business men to escape from jury duty, that it requires special care on the part of the government to secure there competent and impartial jurors. And to that end it may be a wise proceeding on the part of the legislature to enlarge the number of peremptory challenges in criminal cases tried in those cities. The accused cannot complain if he is still tried by an impartial jury. He can demand nothing more. Northern Pac. R. Co. v. Herbert, Sup. Ct. Rep. The right to challenge is the right to reject, not to select, a juror. If, from those who remain, an impartial jury is obtained, the constitutional right of the accused is maintained. In this case it is not even suggested that the jury by which the accused was tried was not a competent and impartial one. He was allowed 20 peremptory challenges, and it does not appear that he exhausted them.
6
7
The fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States does not prohibit legislation which is limited either in the objects to which it is directed, or by the territory within which it is to operate. It merely requires that all persons subjected to such legislation shall be treated alike, under like circumstances and conditions, both in the privileges conferred and in the liabilities imposed. As we said in Barbier v. Connolly, speaking of the fourteenth amendment: 'Class legislation, discriminating against some and favoring others, is prohibited; but legislation which, in carrying out a public purpose, is limited in its application, if within the sphere of its operation it affects alike all persons similarly situated, is not within the amendment.' Sup. Ct. Rep. 
7
8
In Missouri v. Lewis, it was held that the last clause of the amendment as to the equal protection of the laws was not violated by any diversity in the jurisdiction of the several courts which the state might establish, as to subjec -matter, amount, or finality of their decisions, if all persons within the territorial limits of their respective jurisdictions have an equal right in like cases, and under like circumstances, to resort to them for redress; that the state has the right to make political subdivisions of its territory for municipal purposes, and to regulate their local government; and that, as respects the administration of justice, it may establish one system of courts for cities and another for rural districts. And we may add that the systems of procedure in them may be different, without violating any provision of the fourteenth amendment.
8
9
Allowing the state 15 peremptory challenges in capital cases, tried in cities containing a population of over inhabitants, is simply providing against the difficulty of securing, in such cases, an impartial jury in cities of that size, which does not exist in other portions of the state. So far from defeating, it may furnish the necessary means of giving, that equal protection of its laws to all persons, which that amendment declares shall not be denied to any one within its jurisdiction.
9
10
We see nothing in the legislation of Missouri which is repugnant to that amendment. The judgment of the supreme court of that state, therefore, is affirmed.

FORSYTH, impleaded, etc.,
v.
DOOLITTLE and others.
January 17, 1887.
1
This is an action to recover compensation for services rendered by the plaintiffs below to the defendants in effecting a sale of certain lands in Indiana, and in various legal proceedings concerning the title, or claims against them. The declaration alleges a joint contract and liability by the defendants below, Caroline Forsyth and Jacob Forsyth, her husband; but the summons was served on her only. She appeared, and pleaded the general issue. A statute of Illinois provides that sue. A statute of Illinois provides that in actions on contracts, express or implied, against two or more defendants as partners, joint obligors, or payors, proof of their joint liability or partnership shall not be required to entitle the plaintiff to judgment, unless such proof shall be rendered necessary by a plea in abatement, or a plea in bar, denying the partnership or joint liability, verified by affidavit. The joint contract and liability of the defendants, therefore, stood admitted by the pleadings, and this is a sufficient answer to several objections taken to the admissibility of statements and the proof of acts of the defendant, J cob Forsyth. Being jointly liable with Caroline on the contract in suit, his declarations respecting the services rendered under it were as admissible as if made by her.
1
2
The services for which compensation is sought were not only those required of attorneys and counselors at law, but were also those of negotiators seeking to accomplish the result desired by consultation with proposed purchasers, and presentation to them of the advantages to be derived from the property, present and prospective. Varied as were the legal services of the plaintiffs, it is plain from the testimony that those rendered by negotiation and consultation, and presentation of the uses to which the property could be applied, were far more effective and important. This fact necessarily had a controlling weight in estimating the value of the services. It is difficult to apply to such services any fixed standar by which they can be measured, and their value determined, as can be done with reference to services purely professional. There is a tact and skill and a happy manner with some persons which render them successful as negotiators, while others of equal learning, attainments, and intellectual ability fail for the want of those qualities. The compensation to be made in such cases is, by the ordinary judgment of business men, measured by the results obtained. It is not limited by the time occupied or the labor bestowed. It is from overlooking the difference in the rule by which compensation is measured in such cases, and that in cases where the services are strictly of a professional nature, that several objections are urged for reversal of the judgment recovered, which, if this difference were regarded, would not be seriously pressed.
2
3
The services rendered related to so many different subjects that it would require a long narrative to describe them with much detail. It is sufficient for the consideration of the questions not disposed of by what has already been said to state generally the main facts of the case. Caroline Forsyth, for several years before the employment of the plaintiffs, had been the owner of a tract of land consisting of acres in Indiana, about 16 miles from Chicago. Only about acres of it were fit for cultivation. The principal value of the tract was owing to its proximity to Chicago, and to the belief that it could be made use of for manufacturing and commercial purposes as a suburb of that city. It yielded no revenue. There were taxes due upon it, and portions of it had been sold for taxes. It was subject to a mortgage for $ executed in 1875, upon a loan of $ which, with the stipulated interest to maturity, amounted to that sum; and a suit had been commenced by its holders in the circuit court of the United States in Indiana for its foreclosure, and the sale of the premises. The defendants were without means to meet the mortgage debt, or pay the taxes due, or even the expenses of agents dealing with the property, and relied entirely upon effecting a sale to obtain what was needed for these several demands. The defendants had previously made an effort to sell the property to a stock company in London, and had signed certain documents for that purpose. The company claimed a right to a conveyance pursuant to a contract made upon the supposed authority of those documents. Another party, by the name of Horne, claimed that he had negotiated a sale, and was demanding $for his services.
3
4
It was when the property was in this condition, and when its entire loss seemed highly probable, from the inability of the defendants to meet the demands pressing for payment, that the plaintiffs were retained to help them out of their complicated embarrassments and effect a sale of the property, the defendants promising them, in case of success, compensation which should be 'large, liberal, and generous.' The plaintiffs entered upon their employment, and during the following nine months, by arduous labor, constant negotiation, and great tact, they accomplished what was desired. The suit to foreclose the mortgage was resisted, and its dismissal obtained. The property was sold for one million of dollars, one-third of which was paid in cash, and the balance secured by mortgage on the property. The existing mortgage was then redeemed, a large reduction from the amount claimed having been first obtained. The taxes and other debts were paid, and the claim of Horne was compromised and settled. A suit commenced pending these proceedings by the trustee of the London stock company to compel a conveyance of the property was defended and ultimately defeated. It would serve no useful purpose to detail the number of particulars in which the skill and tact of the plaintiffs were exhibited. The claim made by them for compensation was resisted, and this action was thereupon brought. The jury found that it should have been $ and gave their verdict for that amount. Of the justice of this amount we are not to determine. We are called upon only to see whether any error was committed in the manner in which the case was submitted to the jury.
4
5
We see nothing in the objection that evidence was admitted as to the character of the land sold, or its possible value as a future suburb of Chicago. Its character in this respect might increase or diminish the chances of its sale. The only points which we find in the record calling for examination arose from the hypothetical statements submitted to witnesses, with inquiry as to the value of the services thus supposed to have been rendered. There were such hypothetical statements upon five subjects, which embraced matters that were to be disposed of before the consummation of the contract of sale. They embody with some fullness the matters supposed by the plaintiffs to have been established, and it was only upon that assumption that the opinions of the witnesses as to the value of the services rendered were given. If the assumption was erroneous; if the matters supposed to be established were not, in the judgment of the jury, in truth established,—the opinions went for nothing; and so the court instructed the jury.
5
6
Its language was as follows: 'As to the questions, you must understand that they are not evidence; they are mere statements to these witnesses, called by the respective parties, of what the party putting these questions claims the proof shows was the nature and amount of plaintiffs' services rendered; and, upon the hypothesis or assumption of these questions, the witnesses are asked to give their estimate of the value of these services. You must readily see that the value of the answers to these questions depends largely, if not wholly, upon the fact whether the statements made in these questions are sustained by the proof. If the statements in these questions are not supported by the proof, then the answers to the questions are entitled to no weight, because based upon false assumptions or statements of facts.'
6
7
And as to the estimate of the value placed by the witnesses upon the services, the language of the court to the jury was as follows: 'You are not bound by the estimate which these witnesses have put upon these services. They are proper to be considered by you, as part of the proof bearing upon the question of value, as the testimony of men experienced in such matters, and whose judgment may aid yours. But it is your duty, after all, to settle and determine this question of value from all the testimony in the case, and to award to the plaintiffs such amount, by your verdict, as the proof satisfies you is a reasonable compensation for the services which, from the proof, you find plaintiffs rendered, after deducting the amount the plaintiffs have already received for such services.'
7
8
The length of the hypothetical statements is urged as an objection to them. They were lengthy even without the exhibits, which constituted the larger portion; but the court took especial care to impress upon the jury that they were not to consider the statements as facts in the case, b t merely as assumptions of the party propounding the questions. Cowley v. People, The witnesses do not appear to have been confused by their length. They expressed no inability to fully comprehend them. Nor did the court, though complaining of their length, indicate that they were unintelligible to the jury, or tended in any way to turn their minds from the points in issue.
8
9
The length of hypothetical statements presented to a witness to ascertain his opinion upon any matter growing out of the facts supposed, will necessarily depend upon the simple or complicated character of the transactions recited, and the number of particulars which must be considered for the formation of the opinion desired; and this subject, like the extent to which the examination of a witness may be allowed, must, in a great degree, be left to the discretion of the court.
9
10
We do not see that the rights of the defendants were at all prejudiced by them. The judgment, therefore, must be affirmed; and it is so ordered.

HUNTINGTON and others, Assignees, etc.,
v.
SAUNDERS and another.1
January 17, 1887.
1
This is an appeal from the circuit court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts. It was decided in that court upon a demurrer to the bill of complaint; the demurrer being sustained, and the bill dismissed. The bill was brought by the present appellants, as assignees in bankruptcy of William A. Saunders, against said William A. Saunders and Mary P. Saunders, his wife; and, after alleging that, by due course of proceeding, William A. Saunders had been adjudged a bankrupt, and the plaintiffs appointed assignees of his estate, it proceeds to say that they have discovered, within one year, 'and been first informed of, facts and circumstances upon which they believe, and therefore aver, that the said bankrupt, without consideration, transferred to and placed in the hands of his wife, the said Mary P. Saunders, a large amount of personal property in the form of money, bonds, stocks and other securities, none of which can your orators more particularly describe, because all particular information is refused by the bankrupt and his wife, and the persons managing the property for them, and because the same has been invested for income, and often changed in form by reinvestment, and in pursuance of devices for more effectual concealment.' Then it is further averred that 'said property is of the value of about forty thousand dollars, and was so transferred by said bankrupt to his said wife for the purpose of concealing the same from his creditors and from these assignees, and to delay, hinder, and defraud his creditors, he being then deeply indebted, and to an amount wholly beyond his means and ability to liquidate and pay, so that he was hopelessly insolvent and in contemplation of bankruptcy.' The prayer of the bill is 'that said Mary P. Saunders, the respondent, may fully, truly, and particularly answer this bill, but not under oath, which is hereby waived,' and for a decree that said property may be held to belong to the assets of said William A. Saunders in bankruptcy, and the respondent compelled to transfer and deliver the property, or the proceeds thereof, in whatever form existing, to the plaintiffs, as assets of the bankrupt, and for further and other relief.
1
2
The imperfections of this bill are very obvious. Counsel for appellants, conceding the doctrine of Phipps v. Sedgwick, 95 U. S. 3, and Trust Co. v. Sedgwick, that at wife cannot be held liable to a personal judgment for money received of her husband during the marital relation, argues that this bill is an attempt to proceed against a fund in her hands; but as no particular fund is named, as no particular set of securities or description of them is given in the bill, as no place is named where they are deposited, nor any person, even the wife, as holding them, as no real estate is mentioned as belonging to this fund, as the nature and character of the conversion made of the fund after it came to the hands of the wife is not set forth, it seems impossible to maintain such a bill as seeking to lay hold of and appropriate a particular fund coming from the bankrupt himself, or even the proceeds of such a fund. As was very pertinently asked by the circuit judge in his opinion sustaining the demurrer, what relief could be given by the court, or what decree could be granted on this bill, if it were taken pro confesso; no opposition being made to it? It is not possible to see what decree could be made, or what relief could be given. It is not a bill of discovery, because the answer under oath of the defendant is expressly waived. No interrogatories are propounded to either of the defendants; no effort made to obtain from them, or either of them, by way of sworn answer, anything which could be used as evidence in the case. An issue of a general denial of the truth of the bill would leave nothing on which evidence could be introduced. It is, in fact, what is familiarly known as a 'fishing bill.' The plaintiffs allege no distinct fact which the defendants, or either of them, can be called upon to deny. The plaintiffs do not say positively that any of the allegations of the bill are true, but the substance of what they say is that they have received certain information which excites their suspicion; and this information is so vague, so uncertain and indefinite as it regards any fund or any particular sum of money or bonds, or any time or occasion when they were placed in the control of the female defendant, that, unless we are prepared to establish the proposition that, whenever a married woman is suspected of having received money from her husband to the prejudice of his creditors, she must be brought up to answer, and not under oath, as to what she has done with it, this bill must be held to be insufficient.
2
3
In the case of Phipps v. Sedgwick, 95 U. S. 3, which is a case somewhat analogous to this, this court said: 'While the statutes of New York have recognized certain rights of the wife to deal with and contract in reference to her separate property, they fall far short of establishing the principle that out of that separate property she can be made liable for money or property received at her husband's hands, which in equity ought to have gone to pay his debts. Equity has been ready, where such property remains in her hands, to restore it to its proper use, but not to hold her separate estate liable for what she has received, and probably spent at his dictation. Such a proposition would be a very unjust one to the wife while under the dominion, control, and personal influence of the husband. In receiving favors at his hands, which she supposed to be the of erings of affection, or a proper provision for her comfort, she would be subjecting that which was her own, or which might afterwards come to her from other sources, to unknown and unsuspected charges, of the amount and nature of which she would be wholly ignorant. It answers the demands of justice in such cases, if the creditor, finding the property itself in her hands, or in the hands of one holding it with notice, appropriates it to pay his debt. But, if it is beyond his reach, the wife should no more be held liable for it then if the husband himself had spent it in support of his family, or even of his own extravagance.'
3
4
To this principle we adhere; and, as there is no statement or description or reference in this bill to any fund now existing arising out of the bankrupt's gift to his wife, and no call for discovery in regard to any such fund, but an express waiver of an answer under oath, we think the bill was properly dismissed.

v.
ROLLINS and another, Ex'rs, etc.
January 24, 1887.

In October, 1873, the firm of Heinemann, Payson & Morgan bought, paid for, and exported from Taganrog, in Russia, some colored carpet wools, the actual cost of which, exclusive of charges, was below 12 cents per pound at the time and place of exportation. They were imported into the port of New York, and entered at the custom-house there January 5, 1874, at the invoice value of silver rubles. The collector reduced the amount into United States money at cents to the ruble. This made the value of the wool greater than 12 cents per pound, and the collector exacted a duty on it of 6 cents per pound. The importers protested that the ruble should be computed at 75 cents, which would have made the value 12 cents or less per pound, and the duty would have been 3 cents per pound. The tariff act in force at the time of the entry was section 1 of the act of March 2, 1867, (chapter ) which, as applicable to the merchandise, which was wool of the third class, provided as follows: 'Upon wools of the third class, the value whereof at the last port or place whence exported into the United States, excluding charges in such port, shall be twelve cents or less per pound, the duty shall be three cents per pound; upon wools of the same class, the value whereof at the last port or place whence exported to the United States, excluding charges in such port, shall exceed twelve cents per pound, the duty shall be six cents per pound.' The secretary of the treasury, on appeal, confirmed the action of the collector; and the importers, after paying the duty exacted, to obtain their goods, broug t this suit against the collector to recover the alleged excess.

2
Section 1 of the act of March 3, 1843, (chapter ) provided 'that, in all computations of the value of foreign moneys of account at the custom-houses of the United States, * * * the ruble of Russia shall be deemed and taken to be of the value of seventy-five cents.'
2
3
On the third of March, 1873, the following act was approved, () 'Section 1. That the value of foreign coin, as expressed in the money of account of the United States, shall be that of the pure metal of such coin of standard value; and the values of the standard coins in circulation of the various nations of the world shall be estimated annually by the director of the mint, and proclaimed on the first day of January by the secretary of the treasury.
3
4
'Sec. 2. That in all payments by or to the treasury, whether made here or in foreign countries, when it becomes necessary to compute the value of the sovereign or pound sterling, it shall be deemed equal to four dollars eighty-six cents and six and one-half mills; and the same rule shall be applied in appraising merchandise imported when the value is, by the invoice, in sovereigns, or pounds sterling, and in the construction of contracts payable in sovereigns or pounds sterling; and this valuation shall be the par of exchange between Great Britain and the United States; and all contracts made after the first day of January, 1874, based on an assumed par of exchange with Great Britain, of fifty-four pence to the dollar, or four dollars forty-four and four-ninths cents to the sovereign or pound sterling, shall be null and void.
4
5
'Sec. 3. That all acts and parts of acts inconsistent with these provisions be, and the same are hereby, repealed.'
5
6
In pursuance of this statute the director of the mint estimated the value of the Russian ruble for the year cents in the United States money of account, and the secretary of the treasury thereafter, on the twentieth of December, 1873, proclaimed, by a circular addressed to the collectors of customs, that, 'from and after January 1, 1874, the following table of standard values of foreign moneys, reduced to the moneys of account of the United States, will, until otherwise provided for by law or regulation, be taken at custom-houses in computing the invoice value of all imported merchandise expressed in such currency, to-wit, Russian rebles of copecks, silver, '
6
7
The foregoing facts appearing at the trial of the case before the court and a jury, the plaintiffs contended that the wool was purchased before the act of March 3, 1873, took effect, and that the value in United States money should have been computed as of the time of exportation. These positions were overruled by the court, and it directed the jury to find a verdict for the defendant, which was done under the objection and exception of the plaintiffs. To review a judgment for the defendant the plaintiffs have brought this writ of error.
7
8
The decision of this court in Collector v. Richards, establishes that the effect of the act of was to fix the value of the Russian silver ruble, in the money of account of the United States, for the purpose of computing, at the custom-house, the amount of an invoice of imported goods, and consequently to repeal the act of See, also, Cramer v. Arthur, Hadden v. Merritt, Sup. Ct. Rep. 
8
9
Evidence that the merchandise cost, exclusive of charges, less than 12 cents per pound at the time and place of exportation, could not affect the question, because, although the duty was imposed according to the value of the goods 'at the last port or place whence exported to the United States,' yet, when that value was stated, in the invoice, in the foreign silver currency, its equivalent in the money of account of the United States could not be computed, for the purpose of the entry of the goods at the cus om-house for duty, at any sum less than the invoice or entered balue. Section 7 of the act of March ) in force at the time of this importation, provided that, in all cases where the duty imposed by law should be based upon the value of any specified quantity of merchandise, the value upon which the duty should be assessed should be its actual market value or wholesale price at the period of exportation, in the principal markets of the country of exportation, but that the duty should not be assessed 'upon an amount less than the invoice or entered value, any act of congress to the contrary not withstanding.' This made it imperative on the collector to compute the value of the silver ruble, at the time of the entry, according to that value as determined in accordance with the act of which was cents. The duty was imposed by the statute, 'according to the value of the goods at the time and place of exportation.' The importer stated that 'value,' in the foreign coin, in his invoice and entry. The statute as to computation applied, as of the date of the entry, to such entered value. Hence it could not affect the question to show that the 'cost' of the goods abroad, computing the ruble at a lower rate, as of the date of exportation, was 12 cents or less per pound. Judgment affirmed.

ROBERTS, EX'X, etc.,
v.
PHOENIX MUT. LIFE INS. CO. OF HARTFORD, CONN.
January 24, 1887.
1
On the twenty-seventh of August, 1872, the Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Company of Hartford, Connecticut, a Connecticut corporation, issued a policy, No. whereby, in consideration of the representations made to them in the application for the policy, and the sum of $to it duly paid 'by A. B. Cook, creditor,' and of the annual payment of a like amount on or before the twenty-seventh day of August in every year during the continuance of the policy, it assured the life of William G. Harvison, of Louisville, Kentucky, in the amount of $ for the term of his natural life, the amount of the insurance to be paid, after the death of Harvison, 'to the said A. B. Cook, creditor, and his executors, administrators, or assigns,' 'any indebtedness to the company on account of this policy being first deducted therefrom.' The policy was in force at the death of Harvison, which occurred August 25, 1880. Fannie M. Cook, the wife of the said A. B. Cook, both of whom resided at Louisville, Kentucky, commenced a suit in March, 1881, in a state court of Kentucky, against the company, to recover on the policy $ with interest, being the amount of the policy, less certain premium notes. She based her claim to recover on a written assignment, which she alleged had been executed by her husband, A. B. Cook, and delivered to her on the nineteenth of September, 1872, 23 days after the date of the policy, and which was in these words:
1
2
'This instrument of writing certifies that the policy No. I have taken out on the life of Wm. G. Harvison for twenty thousand ($ dollars, in the Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Company of Hartford, Connecticut, was taken out by me for the sole benefit of my wife, Fannie M. Cook; and I hereby declare that the above-mentioned life policy of $ and the money secured thereby, is given and assigned to my said wife as separate estate, and shall continue to be the separate estate of my said wife; and, whether the said Harvison dies before or after me, my said wife shall have and receive and hold said money as her separate estate, and for her separate and sole benefit, to dispose of as she may think proper.
2
3
'Witness my hand this nineteenth day of September, 1872, at Louisville, Ky.
3
4
A. B. Cook.' The suit was remo ed into the circuit court of the United States for the district of Kentucky, where the plaintiff filed a bill in equity making the company and A. B. Cook defendants, and praying judgment against the company for the $ and interest. The company answered, setting up various defenses, on which issue was joined. A. B. Cook also answered. On a hearing on proofs, the court dismissed the bill, without delivering any opinion, oral or written. The plaintiff appealed to this court. She has since died, and her executrix has been substituted as plaintiff.
4
5
It appears, by the proofs, that A. B. Cook, on the fourteenth of June, 1880. and before Harvison's death, received from the company $ and delivered to it the policy, and the following instrument, signed by him, indorsed on the policy:
5
6
'LOUISVILLE, KY., June 14, 1880.
6
7
'I hereby sell, transfer, and assign to the Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co. of Hartford, Conn., all right and title to the within policy on the life of W. G. Harvison, in consideration of the sum of four thousand dollars in hand paid, by draft on the said Co., and a return of the premium notes.
7
8
'A. B. Cook.'
8
9
Among the defenses set up and urged by the defendant were (1) that A. B. Cook, who was a witness for his wife, was not a competent witness for her under the statutes of Kentucky; (2) that no assignment of the policy by A. B. Cook to his wife was ever in fact executed and delivered; (3) that Fannie A. Cook had no insurable interest in the life of Harvison, and therefore could not become assignee of the policy; (4) that the statement in the application for the policy, that Harvison was not addicted to the habitual use of spirituous liquors, was untrue; (5) that after the policy was issued the habits of Harvison become, as to the use of spirituous liquors, so far different from his habits as to such use represented in the application, as to make the risk more than ordinarily hazardous.
9
10
Without considering any of the other questions raised, we are of opinion that, as a matter of fact, and even conceding that A. B. Cook was a competent witness, the assignment by him to his wife is not satisfactorily proved to have been made or delivered prior to the transaction of June 14, 1880. The evidence on that point is conflicting, and it would not be profitable to discuss it in detail. As the suit cannot be maintained without proof of the assignment, the decree is affirmed.

120 U.S. 89
UNITED STATES
v.
PARKER and another.
January 24, 1887.
1
This is an action at law commenced by the United States on the eighteenth of November, 1885, against Hubbard G. Parker, as principal, and William M. Stewart, as surety, upon an official bond executed on the twelfth day of March, 1867, in the penal sum of $ the condition of which was that whereas, the said Hubbard G. Parker had been appointed superintendent of Indian affairs for Nevada, and had accepted such appointent, if the said Hubbard G. Parker should at all times carefully discharge the duties thereof, and faithfully expend all public moneys, and honestly account for the same, and for all public property which should or might come into his hands, without fraud or delay, the obligation should be void.
1
2
It is alleged in the complaint that after the execution of the bond, and while the defendant Parker still held and remained in said office, and prior to November 18, 1869, the plaintiff placed in his hands various and sundry large sums of money to be expended by him for the benefit of the Indians of Nevada, and to be properly accounted for by him; that on said November 18, 1869, 'there then and ever since has remained, and now remains, of said moneys, in said defendant Parker's hands, unexpended and unaccounted for, the sum of $' and, he having failed to account for or to return the same to the plaintiff, judgment is prayed for against the defendants for that amount, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum from November 18, 1869.
2
3
'That heretofore, to-wit, on the twenty-seventh day of November, A. D. the said above-named plaintiff commenced an action in the circuit court of the United States, Ninth circuit, and district of Nevada, against said above-named defendants, upon the official bond of the defendant Hubbard G. Parker, as superintendent of Indian affairs for Nevada, (the same identical bond as set out in the complaint herein,) to recover the sum of fifteen thousand one hundred and eight and dollars, together with interest and costs; that said action was commenced by the filing of a complaint, and the issuance of summons thereon in due form of law; that the said defendants appeared in said action by their attorneys, Ellis & King, and on, towit, December 15, A. D. filed their answer to the complaint, and, among other things, denied that there was any balance due the United States from the said defendant Hubbard G. Parker, as superintendent of Indian affairs for Nevada, or otherwise; that said United States circuit court had jurisdiction of the parties and the subject-matter of said action; that afterwards, and on, to-wit, the first day of December, A. D. said cause came on for trial in the said circuit court of the United States and district of Nevada, before fore Hon. LORENZO SAWYER, circuit judge, and Hon. E. W. HILLYER. United States district judge for Nevada, the plaintiff being represented by its duly authorized and appointed attorney for the district of Nevada, Jonas Seely, and the defendants being represented by their attorneys, Messrs. Ellis & King; that thereupon the defendants, by their attorneys, presented to the court a statement of accounts duly certified by the second auditor and second comptroller of the treasury department of plaintiff, showing that said defendant Hubbard G. Parker's accounts with the United States, as superintendent of Indian affairs for Nevada, had been settled and adjusted, and that the said defendant Parker was discharged from all claims of the United States, as superintendent of Indian affairs for Nevada or otherwise, and that said Parker was not indebted to the United States in any sum whatever, as superintendent of Indian affairs for Nevada or otherwise.
3
4
'Whereupon, in open court, on motion of defendants' attorneys, the district attorney, representing the United States, consenting thereto, the following judgment was duly made and entered, to-wit: 'Upon motion of Ellis & King, attorneys for defendants, and it appearing to the court that the subject-matter in this suit has been adjusted and setted by the proper parties in Washington, it is therefore ordered that this cause be, and the same is hereby, dismissed.'
4
5
'Defendants further aver that said judgment, so as aforesaid made and entered, is a bar to any and all claims of the plaintiff in this action against each and all of the said defendants, and that the said plaintiff is estopped thereby, and ought not to have or maintain this action.
5
6
'And, for further and separate answer, defendants aver that on the twenty-first day of June, A. D. the said defendant Hubbard G. Parker, as superintendent of Indian affairs for Nevada, made a full settlement with proper officers of the United States of all his accounts as superintendent of Indian affairs for Nevada, and his accounts were finally adjusted and settled by the second auditor and second comptroller of the treasury department of plaintiff, whereby he was fully discharged from all obligations and demands of the United States, as superintendent of Indian affairs for Nevada or otherwise.
6
7
'Defendants further aver that the pretended claim against these defendants for six thousand one hundred and eighty-four and dollars is founded upon a pretended readjustment of the accounts of the said defendant Parker by the second auditor and second comptroller of the treasury department of plaintiff, made on the twenty-fifth day of June, A. D. and that such pretended readjustment was made without authority of law, that the said settlement and adjustment made on the twenty-first day of June, A. D. aforesaid, was final and conclusive, and a bar to the pretended claim for $herein, or any claim of the United States against these defendants, or either of them.'
7
8
To this answer the plaintiff demurred, on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a bar to the cause of action set out in the complaint. This demurrer was overruled; and, the attorney for the plaintiff resting his case upon the demurrer, judgment was entered in favor of the defendants, to reverse which the United States have sued out and now prosecute this writ of error.
8
9
In the view which we take of the case, it is not necessary to consider the validity of the second defense set up in the answer. The points relied upon by the plaintiff in error, so far as the first defense is concerned, are (1) that the former judgment relied on as an estoppel does not appear to be for the same cause of action as that on which recovery is now sought; and (2) that the judgment is not a final judgment on the merits. The two actions are upon the same bond, but it is alleged that it does not sufficiently appear that the recovery sought in the two actions is upon the same breach. In the first action the amount alleged to be due was $ the action having been brought November 27, 1871. On the trial the defendants presented to the court the defendants persented to the court a statement of accounts, duly certified by the second auditor and second comptroller of the treasury department, showing that the defendant Parker's accounts with the United States, as superintendent of Indian affairs for Nevada, had been settled and adjusted, and that Parker was thereby discharged from all claims of the United States against him, as superintendent of Indian affairs for Nevada or otherwise, and that said Parker was not indebted to the United States in any sum whatever, as superintendent of Indian affairs for Nevada or otherwise.
9
10
It is stated, by way of recital in the judgment itself, that it thus appeared to the court 'that the subject-matter in this suit has been adjusted and settled by the proper parties in Washington.' This recital, together with the judgment founded on it, was entered by the consent of the attorney representing the United States, who thus in open court officially admitted the effect of the evidence to be as claimed. The present action was begun on the eighteenth of November, 1885, but the breach alleged occurred on November 18, 1869, the judgment demanded being for the amount stated then to have become due, with interest thereon from that date. The cause of action, therefore, arose and existed at that time, and if in existence now it must have been so at the date of the trial of the first action, to-wit, December 1, 1873. It is therefore a fair and reasonable, if not a necessary, inference that the amount alleged to be due in the present action was part of the larger amount sought to be recovered in the former action. It is not material that the two sums are not identical; it is sufficient that the smaller was part of the larger amount. In the first cause there might have been a recovery, if the proof had justified, for a sum less than that demanded. It was found and adjudged by the court in that cause, not only that the whole sum demanded was not due, but that there was nothing due from the defendant to the United States; and, if nothing was then due, the amount now sought to be recovered must have been adjudged not to have been due; for if due now, according to the averments of the complaint, it was due from a time prior to the date of that trial and judgment. The averment is that it was due on and from November 18, 1869. It may be, according to the rule of pleading at common law, where a former judgment is set up by way of a bar to the action as an estoppel, the plea in this case would not be regarded as sufficiently certain, for want of an express averment that the amount sought to be recovered in this action was part of the same amount sought to be recovered in the prior action. But the rules of the common law as to pleading are not in force in Nevada, where the procedure is regulated by a statutory code, which governs the practice of the courts of the United States sitting therein in common-law cases by virtue of section of the Revised Statutes. This code, like other similar codes regulating the practice of the state courts, has relaxed the strictness of the common-law rules of pleading, so that now, instead of construing pleadings strictly against the party, they are to be construed liberally in his favor, for the furtherance of justice.
10
11
Section 70 of the civil procedure act of the state of Nevada, approved March 8, 1869, being section of the General Statutes of Nevada of is as follows: 'In the construction of a pleading for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations shall be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.' In commenting on this section, the supreme court of Nevada, in Ferguson v. Virginia & Truckee R. Co., uses the following language: 'But the rule construing pleadings most strongly against a pleader has been replaced in this state by the more liberal rule prescribed in section 70 of the practice act. This section is the same as section of the New York Code. The result of the decisions in that state seems to be that on a general demurrer the allegations of a complaint will be construed as liberally in favor of the pleader as, before the Code, they would have been construed after the verdict for the plaintiff; that is, they will be construed in such a sense as to support the cause of action or the defense. Moak's Van Santy. Pl. (3d Ed.) side page et seq. In this state a similar doctrine has been declared in State v. Central Pac. Co., '
11
12
Applying this rule, it becomes quite clear that the pleading in question sufficiently avers all the facts necessary to constitute the former judgment a bar to the present action.
12
13
The second question is whether the judgment rendered in the first action was final. It is claimed to be equivalent only to a nonsuit, and therefore not res judicata. A judgment of nonsuit, whether rendered because of the failure of the plaintiff to appear and prosecute his action, or because upon the trial he fails to prove the particulars necessary to make good his action, or when rendered by consent upon an agreed statement of facts, is not conclusive as an estoppel, because it does not determine the rights of the parties. Homer v. Brown, Manhattan Life Ins. Co. v. Broughton, Sup. Ct. Rep. 99; Haldeman v. U. S., But a nonsuit is to be distinguished from a retraxit. Minor v. Mechanics' Bank, 1 Pet. 45. Blackstone defines the difference as follows: 'A retraxit differs from a nonsuit in this: One is negative, and the other positive. The nonsuit is a mere default or neglect of the plaintiff, and therefore he is allowed to begin his suit again upon payment of costs; but a retraxit is an open, voluntary renunciation of his claim in court, and by this he forever loses his action.' And it has been held that a judgment of dismissal, when based upon and entered in pursuance of the agreement of the parties, must be understood, in the absence of anything to the contrary expressed in the agreement and contained in the judgment itself, to amount to such an adjustment of the merits of the controversy, by the parties themselves, through the judgment of the court, as will constitute a defense to another action afterwards brought upon the same cause of action. Bank of Commonwealth v. Hopkins, Merritt v. Campbell, It is clearly so when, as here, the judgment recites that the subject-matter of the suit had been adjusted and settled by the parties. This is equivalent to a judgment that the plaintiff had no cause of action, because the defense of the defendant was found to be sufficient in law and true in fact. Upon general principles of the common law, regulating the practice and procedure of courts of justice, it must be held that the judgment here in question was rendered upon the merits of the case, is final in its form and nature, and must have the effect of a bar to the present action upon the same cause.
13
14
If its effect is to be determined by the statutes of Nevada, the same conclusion will be reached. The civil practice act of that state, passed March 8, 1869, (Gen. St. Nev. ) is as follows: 'An action may be dismiss d, or a judgment of nonsuit entered, in the following cases: First. By the plaintiff himself at any time before trial, upon the payment of costs, if a counter-claim has not been made. If a provisional remedy has been allowed, the undertaking shall thereupon be delivered by the clerk to the defendant, who may have his action thereon. Second. By either party, upon the written consent of the other. Third. By the court when the plaintiff fails to appear on the trial, and the defendant appears and asks for the dismissal. Fourth. By the court when, upon trial and before the final submission of the case, the plaintiff abandons it. Fifth. By the court, upon motion of the defendant, when upon the trial the plaintiff fails to prove a sufficient case for the jury. The dismissal mentioned in the first two subdivisions shall be made by an entry in the clerk's register. Judgment may thereupon be entered accordingly. In every other case the judgment shall be rendered on the merits.'
14
15
It thus appears that there are five instances in which the dismissal of an action has the force only of a judgment of nonsuit. 'In every other case,' the statute provides, 'the judgment shall be rendered on the merits.' If the case at bar is not included among the enumerated cases in which a dismissal is equivalent to a nonsuit, it must therefore be a judgment on the merits. In the present case the suit was not dismissed by the plaintiff himself before trial, nor by one party upon the written consent of the other, nor by the court for the plaintiff's failure to appear on the trial, nor by the court at the trial for an abandonment by the plaintiff of his cause. Neither was it a dismissal by the court, upon motion of the defendant, on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to prove a sufficient case for the jury at the trial. The judgment was rendered upon the evidence offered by the defendants, which could only have been after the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case. That evidence was passed upon judicially by the court, who determined its effect to be a bar to the cause of action. This was confirmed by the consent of the attorney representing the United States. The judgment of dismissal was based on the ground of the finding of the court, as matter of fact and matter of law, that the subject-matter of the suit had been so adjusted and settled by the parties that there was no cause of action then existing. This was an ascertainment judicially that the defense relied upon was valid and sufficient, and consequently was a judgment upon the merits, finding the issue for the defendants. Being, as already found, for the same cause of action as now sued upon, it operates as a bar to the present suit by way of estoppel.
15
16
The judgment is affirmed.

LITTLE ROCK & FT. S. RY.
v.
WORTHEN, Collector, etc., and others. In Error to the
120 U.S. 103
ENDOWMENT & BENEV. ASS'N OF KANSAS
v.
STATE OF KANSAS.1
January 24, 1887.
1
This was a suit begun by the state of Kansas, in the district court of Lyon county, against the Endowment & Benevolent Association of Kansas, for a forfeiture of its charter because it had neglected to comply with the requirements of chapter of the Laws of Kansas of the year approved March 7, 'providing for the organization and control of mutual life insurance companies in this state.' The case was submitted without pleadings, on an agreed statement of facts, from which it appears that the corporation was organized under the general laws of Kansas, January 7, with the following objects: '(1) To guard its members, to a great extent, against the ills of pecuniary want during life, and especially during the period of infirm old age, and at their death to make a provision for their families and friends, which latter is supposed to be the only physical anxiety of dying man; (2) to create a fund to be paid to the members of the society, in accordance with rules and regulations thereof, whereby the members may the better be enabled to perpetuate and sustain their membership, which in so doing will secure to them and their dependents the continued support and protection of the association; (3) to encourage and promote benevolence, industry, and charity among its members.'
1
2
The district court gave judgment against the corporation, but on what ground does not appear, except, as it may be inferred, from the following reasons assigned in support of a motion for a new trial: '(1) That said chapter is unconstitutional and void; (2) for error of law occurring at the trial, and excepted to by the defendant; (3) that the facts of this case do not warrant either the conclusion of law made by the court, or the judgment herein rendered.'
2
3
When the case went to the supreme court of the state on a petition in error the following was the assignment of errors: '(1) The said court erred in rendering judgment for said plaintiff below; (2) the conclusions of law and the judgment are not authorized or warranted by the facts of the case; (3) said court erred in overruling the motion of the defendant below for a new trial.'
3
4
From this statement it is clear that we have no jurisdiction, as no federal question appears affirmatively on the face of the record. It is true that in the motion for a new trial the question of the constitutionality of chapter of the Acts of was presented, but that is not enough, since it is nowhere shown that any provision of the constitution of the United States was relied on. The suggestion in the motion applies as well to the constitution of the state as to that of the United States, and it has long been settled that we have no jurisdiction unless it distinctly appears that a question under the constitution or a law of the United States not only might have been but actually was raised and decided. Crowell v. Randell, Brown v. Colorado, Sup. Ct. Rep. Chouteau v. Gibson, Sup. Ct. Rep. Detroit City Ry. Co. v. Guthard, Sup. Ct. Rep. Here there is nothing of the kind, and in the assignment of errors on the petition in error to the supreme court of the state no reference was made to any constitutional question whatever, except inferentially under that which relates to overruling the motion for a new trial. Certainly it does not appear unmistakably on the face of the record that the supreme court of the state either knew, or ought to have known, that the validity of the statute in question was challenged on account of its repugnancy to the constitution or laws of the United States. Brown v. Colorado, supra, 97. Indeed, we know of no provision of the constitution which renders such a statute in valid as a whole, and there is nowhere in the record any claim that in the charter of the corporation there was a contract by the state the obligation of which had been impaired by the legislation. If there had been, the validity of the statute could not have been challenged except in its application to this charter, and that was not the objection made either in the motion for a new trial, or anywhere else, that we can discover.

The writ of error is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.

January 24, 1887.

This is an appeal under section 5 of the act of March ) from an order of the circuit court remanding a case which had been removed from a state court, on the ground that the suit was one 'arising under the constitution and laws of the United States.' All the parties, both plaintiffs and defendants, are citizens of Louisiana, and the right of removal depends entirely on the question whether it appears on the face of the record that there is in the case a real and substantial dispute or controversy arising under the constitution or laws of the United States; that is to say, whether 'some title, right, privilege, or immunity, on which the recovery depends, will be defeated by one construction of the constitution or a law of the United States, or sustained by the opposite construction.'

At some time prior to September, 1878, Thomas J. Martin brought suit in the Eighth district court of the parish of Madison, Louisiana, against Thomas W. Watts, as principal, and Philip Hoggatt, then in life, as surety, 'on a contract of rent.' Pending this suit Hoggatt died, and Mrs. Martha A. Gibbs was appointed and qualified as administratrix of his succession. The suit was then revived, and afterwards conducted contradictorily with the administratrix. At November term, a judgment was rendered in favor of the administratrix, rejecting the demand against the succession of Hoggatt. By agreement of Martin and Watts a new trial was awarded, but it is claimed that the administratrix of Hoggatt was not a party to this agreement, and that no new trial was ever ordered as to her. At November term, a second trial was had and judgment rendered. On appeal to the supreme court of the state this judgment was reversed, and a new judgment given against Watts and the succession of Hoggatt in solido. At May term, of the district court, a rule was taken on the administratrix of Hoggatt to show cause why the property of the succession should not be sold to pay this judgment. To this rule the administratrix made answer, setting up the original judgment in her favor rejecting the claim, and averring that the subsequent proceedings were null and void as to the succession for lack of jurisdiction. The defense was sustained in the district court, but, on appeal to the supreme court, this was reversed, and the district court afterwards, in obedience to the mandate of the supreme court, made the rule absolute, and directed the administratrix to cause the property to be sold to pay the judgment.

In this condition of things the heirs of Hoggatt, on the first of August, 1885, filed their petition in the district court against the administrator of the estate of Martin, who had died pending the original proceedings, and the administratrix of Hoggatt, to restrain the sale which had been ordered, and to annul the judgment of the supreme court against the estate, on the ground that after the original judgment in her favor the administratrix was no longer a party to the suit, and that the estate was not bound by the subsequent proceedings therein. In the petition it is averred, in various forms, that the judgment against the administratrix, when she was not a party to the suit, was 'absolutely null and void, as being repugnant to and in conflict with the provisions of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States, and an attempt to deprive these petitioners of their property without due process of law.' On the third of August a writ of injunction, as prayed for, was issued on the allowance of the judge of the district court, and the next day this writ and a citation in the suit were served on the administrator of Martin. On the twenty-third of October, 1885, the heirs of Hoggatt filed in the state court their petition for the removal of the suit to the circuit court of the United States, as 'a suit of a civil nature, in equity, * * * arising under the constitution and laws of the United States, the said suit being a bill in equity to avoid the mandate, judgments, and decrees of the honorable the supreme court of Louisiana, and of your honorable court, for the reason that said mandate, judgments, and decrees are repugnant to and in conflict with the provisions of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States.' After the case was entered in the circuit court, Crandall moved that it be remanded, and this motion was granted July 20, 1886, the court 'being of opinion that the record does not disclose a case within the jurisdiction of the court.'

This order was clearly right. The case as made by the plaintiffs presents no disputed question of federal law. If the administratrix of the estate of Hoggatt was not a party to the proceedings after the first judgment in her favor, no one can claim that the succession she represented was bound by what was afterwards done in the suit. All depends on whether she continued to be in law and in fact a party; and this is to be determined by the effect of the original judgment in her favor, and the form of the proceedings thereafter. This may involve a consideration of the law and practice in Louisiana, but it is not, so far as anything now appears on the record, at all dependent for its solution on any construction of the constitution or laws of the United States. As was said in Gold-washing & Water Co. v. Keyes, 'Before a circuit court can be required to retain a cause under this jurisdiction, it must in some form appear upon the record, by a statement of facts in 'legal and logical form,' such as is required in good pleading, that the suit is one which 'really and substantially involves a dispute or controversy' as to a right which depends upon the construction or effect of the constitution or some law or treaty of the United States.' It is not enough for the party who seeks a removal of his cause to say that the suit is one arising under the constitution. He must state the facts so as to enable the court to see whether the right he claims does really and substantially depend on a construction of that instrument. That has not been done in this case, and the order remanding the suit is consequently affirmed.

UNITED STATES
v.
SCHLESINGER and another, doing Business under the
Firm Name and Style of Naylor & Co.1
January 24, 1887.
1
This is an action at law brought by the United States against the members of the firm of Naylor & Co., in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts, to recover a sum of money claimed to be due as duties on merchandise imported into the port of Boston from England, in January, 1880. The importers paid the estimated amount of duties, and obtained possession of the goods, and this suit was brought to recover the difference between the duties so paid and a larger amount at which the collector subsequently liquidated the duties. The case was tried by the court without a jury, evidence being introduced by both parties. The court found the following facts: 'The defendants imported into Boston, from Liverpool, the merchandise named in plaintiffs' declaration, which they [the defendants] invoiced and entered as 'scrap steel,' dutiable at 30 per cent. ad valorem. At the time of the entry they paid the estimated duties thereon, calculated at 30 per cent. ad valorem, and all the merchandise was thereupon then delivered to them. No question was made but that a portion of the merchandise was dutiable at 30 per cent. ad valorem, as entered. The other and disputed portion of the merchandise consisted of pieces of steel railway bars, sawed at both ends, from two feet to six feet in length. After entry the whole merchandise was weighed by customs officers. Proper examination was made thereof by the appraiser, who duly made report thereon to the collector, who in due course and form of la liquidated the entries; classifying the undisputed portion of the merchandise as it was entered, and assessing the duty thereon at 30 per cent. ad valorem, but classifying the disputed portion as 'steel in bars, dutiable at 2 1/4 cents a pound, under department decision of October ' Against this classification of the disputed portion of the merchandise, and the ascertainment and liquidation of the duty thereon, the defendants duly protested, and appealed to the secretary of the treasury, who sustained the action of the collector, and, the defendants not paying the duty thus ascertained and assessed, this action was brought. The plaintiffs claimed that the decision of the secretary of the treasury, under the provisions of section of the Revised Statutes of the United States, was final and conclusive, the defendants not having paid the duties and brought suit to recover the amount so paid, and that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover the whole amount found due upon liquidation by the collector, with interest, which amount so found due was $ It also appeared that, owing to error in the supposed weight and amount of the merchandise when the estimated duties were paid, the proper duty due upon all the importations, calling the merchandise 'scrap steel,' as entered, and dutiable at 30 per cent. ad valorem, was $more than had been paid as the estimated duty thereon; which sum of $is included in the above amount of $ The defendants introduced testimony tending to show, and the court found as a fact, that the steel railway bars above described were commercially known as 'scrap steel,' and that they were fit only to be remanufactured.'
1
2
Upon the foregoing facts the court ruled, as matter of law, that the assessment of duty by the collector upon the disputed portion of the merchandise was illegal, and that the plaintiffs were not, under the provisions of section entitled to recover the full amount they claimed, and ordered judgment for the plaintiffs for $only. To this ruling and order the plaintiffs excepted; and, judgment being entered for them for $ they have brought this writ of error.
2
3
The circuit court, in its decision, made in December, ) construed sections of the Revised Statutes. Section as it stood at the time of these importations, and stands now, reads as follows: 'Any person who shall have made payment under protest, and in order to obtain possession of merchandise imported for him, to any collector, or person acting as collector, of any money as duties, when such amount of duties was not, or was not wholly, authorized by law, may maintain an action in the nature of an action at law, which shall be triable by jury, to ascertain the validity of such demand and payment of duties, and to recover back any excess so paid. But no recovery shall be allowed in such action unless a protest [and appeal shall have been taken as prescribed in section twenty-nine hundred and thirty-one.]' The portion contained in brackets was inserted by the act of February ) in place of the words, 'in writing, and signed by the claimant or his agent, was made and delivered at or before the payment, setting forth distinctly and specifically the grounds of objection to the amount claimed.' Section as it originally stood in the Revised Statutes, was a re-enactment of the act of February )
3
Section is a re-enactment of section 14 of the act of June ) and is in these words: 'On the entry of any vessel, or of any merchandise, the decision of the collector of customs at the port of importation and entry, as to the rate and amount of duties to be paid on the tonnage of such vessel or on such merchandise, and the dutiable costs and charges thereon, shall be final and conclusive against all persons interested therein, unless the owner, master, commander, or consignee of such vessel, in the case of duties levied on tonnage, or the owner, importer, consignee, or agent of the merchandise, in the case of duties levied on merchandise, or the costs and charges thereon, shall, within ten days after the ascertainment and liquidation of the duties by the proper officers of the customs, as well in cases of merchandise entered in bond as for consumption, give notice in writing to the collector on each entry, if dissatisfied with his decision, setting forth therein, distinctly and specifically, the grounds of his objection thereto, and shall, within thirty days after the date of such ascertainment and liquidation, appeal therefrom to the secretary of the treasury. The decision of the secretary on such appeal shall be final and conclusive; and such vessel or merchandise, or costs and charges, shall be liable to duty accordingly, unless suit shall be brought within ninety days after the decision of the secretary of the treasury on such appeal for any duties which shall have been paid, before the date of such decision, on such vessel, or on such merchandise, or costs or charges, or within ninety days after the payment of duties paid after the decision of the secretary. No suit shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any duties alleged to have been erroneously or illegally exacted, until the decision of the secretary of the treasury shall have been first had on such appeal, unless the decision of the secretary shall be delayed more than ninety days from the date of such appeal in case of an entry at any port east of the Rocky mountains, or more than five months in case of an entry west of those mountains.' The view of the circuit court was that, under section there could be no suit against a collector to recover back an excess of duties paid on merchandise imported, unless the payment, in addition to being made under protest, was made 'in order to obtain possession' of the merchandise; that section did not destroy the limitation imposed by section on the right to sue to recover back duties, or create any right to sue independently of such limitation; and that, consequently, as it was plain, as a fact, that the $of duties liquidated and sought to be recovered were illegally imposed, the importers could not, after paying them, recover them back, but could obtain the benefit of the exemption from the duty demanded by a defense in this suit, and by that means alone.
4
5
We concur in this view, and are of opinion that the proper construction of section in view of the fact that section is in force concurrently with it, is that the decision of the secretary of the treasury is not final and conclusive, except in a case where, after a protest and an appeal, a payment of duties is made in order to obtain possession of the goods, and then a suit is not brought to recover back the duties within the times and under the limitations prescribed by section That being so, it is not final in the present case, there having been a payment of estimated duties, a delivery of the goods, a reliquidation assessing further duties, a protest, an appeal, and a suit against the importers by the United States to recover the further duties.

6
The United States cite the decision of the district court of the United States for the Southern district of New York in U. S. v. Cousinery, and the cases of Watt v. U. S., 15 Blatchf. 29, and U. S. v. Phelps, as sustaining the view maintained by them. The first case cited was decided in April, 1874, before the enactment of the Revised Statutes, in June, 1874; the second case in July, 1878; and the third in November, 1879. But this court, in November, 1883, in Arnson v. Mur- phy against a collector in 1879 to recover back duties exacted in 1871, held that the only existing authority for such a suit was to be found in the provisions f sections taken together. In the opinion of this court at October term, in Barney v. Watson, a suit brought to recover back duties paid in March, 1864, on an importation made in December, 1863, it was suggested that the act of February 26, 1845, now section was supplied by section 14 of the act June 30, 1864, now section and was thus repealed by implication. That case, however, arose before the act of June 30, 1864, was passed, and not under it, though adjudged here after it was enacted. But the decision in Arnson v. Murphy was based on the view that sections co-exist, and must be construed together. So what was held in U. S. v. Cousinery, under the idea that section 14 of the act of June 30, 1864, was the only statute to be considered, (and the act of February 26, 1845, is not alluded to in the decision,) is of no force when sections are both of them to be taken into consideration as coexisting. The same remarks apply to what was ruled, on the same basis, in U. S. v. Phelps.
6
7
In Watt v. U. S., 15 Blatchf. 29, the suit was by the United States to recover duties liquidated in 1876 on an importation made in 1872, and there was no appeal after liquidation; and it was held that for that reason the defendant could not attack the liquidation.
7
8
Nor does anything in the decision in Westray v. U. S., control the present case. That case had reference, it is true, to section 14 of the act of June 30, 1864, and the suit was one by the United States on a bond given on the entry of goods for warehousing, conditioned to pay the amount of duties to be ascertained to be due and owing on the goods. The duties were afterwards liquidated. The defendants, at the trial, offered to show that the duties should have been less. The evidence was excluded, on the ground that there had been no appeal from the decision of the collector, and this court sustained the ruling.

OTIS.
OTIS
v.
UNITED STATES.
January 24, 1887.

These are appeals by both parties from a judgment rendered by the court of claims in favor of George K. Otis against the United States for $ The claims of Otis are founded on two contracts for carrying the mails, on two routes, No. The findings of fact by the court of claims, contained in the record, are set forth at length in the report of the case in Such of them as are material are as follows:
1
 Finding No. 1. The United States advertised, March 1, 1877, by an advertisement headed 'Mail-station Service, New York City,' for proposals 'for carrying the mails of the United States from July 1, 1877, to June 30, 1881, in the city of New York, as herein specified. Route No. ' The findings state that the advertisement designated the points to and from which the mails should be carried, but those points are not set forth in the findings. The advertisement then proceeded: 'It is to be understood and agreed that any increase in the service which may be rendered necessary by the removal to other localities of any of the above-named stations, or by any other cause, may be ordered by the postmaster general, and shall be paid for pro rata; and also that compensation, pro rata, shall be deducted in case of decrease in said service, caused by any such removal, or by the discontinuance of any of said stations.'
2
3
Under this advertisement, Otis made a written proposal 'to carry the mails of the United States from July 1, 1877, to June 30, 1881, on route No. between New York city post-office and branch offices, state of New York, under the advertisement of the postmaster general dated March 1, 1877,' for the sum of $per annum. On the thirteenth of April, 1877, a written contract was executed by the United States and Otis, which recited that the proposal of Otis, under said advertisement, 'for the performance of the mailstation service at the city of New York, in the said advertisement described,' at the price and for the term above named, had been accepted, and then proceeded: 'Now, therefore, the said contractor and his sureties do, jointly and severally, undertake, covenant, and agree with the United States of America to carry the mail of the United States, using such proper means therefor, and particularly the wagons hereinafter described, as may be necessary to transport the whole of said mail, whatever may be its size or weight, during the term of this contract, * * * and any new or additional mail-station service which may become necessary and be required by the postmaster general during the term of this contract. * * * It is further understood and agreed that any increase in the service which may be rendered necessary by the removal to other localities of any of the above-named stations, or by any other cause, may be ordered by the postmaster general, and shall be paid for pro rata; and also that compensation, pro rata, shall be deducted in case of decrease in said service, caused by any such removal, or by the discontinuance of any of said stations.'
3
4
Otis, while engaged in carrying the mails under this contract, and also under the contract for mail-messenger service, set forth hereinafter in finding No. 2, was directed by the postmaster in New York city to perform the following trips: Eighteen round trips per week from Station E, No. Eighth avenue, to the Hudson River Railroad depot, Thirtieth street and Tenth avenue; six trips per week from post-office to Harlem Railroad depot, Forty-second street and Fourth avenue, A. M. train. These trips were duly performed. The service between Station E and the Hudson River Railroad depot amounted to miles. The allowance therefor, under said station-service contract, would be $ The service between the post-office and the Harlem Railroad depot amounted to miles. The allowance therefor, under said station-service contract, would be $.
4
 Finding No. 2. The United States advertised March 1, 1877, by an advertisement headed, 'Mail-messenger Service, New York City,' for proposals 'for carrying the mails of the United States between the post-office in the city of New York and the railroad stations and steam-boat landings, and between the several stations where transfer service is required, from July 1, 1877, to June 30, 1881,' on route No. The advertisement then proceeded:

6
'The following schedule shows the mail-messenger and transfer service now required at New York; but the accepted bidder under this advertisement will be required to perform, without additional compensation, any and all new or additional service that may become necessary during the term of the contract, whether to and between depots and landings now established, or those which may be hereafter established. Bids must be made with this distinct understanding, and must name the amount per annum for the whole service, and not by the trip. There will be no diminution of compensation on account of the discontinuance of such portions of the service as may become unnecessary during the contract term; but deductions will be made for neglect of duty. .

'It is hereby stipulated and agreed that the postmaster general may, if it be required by the public interest, order new or additional service which may become necessary to be performed, which shall be performed without additional compensation; also that he may discontinue or curtail the service, in whole or in part, if in his judgment the public interest shall so require, he allowing as full indemnity to the contractor one month's extra pay on the amount of service dispensed with, and a pro rata compensation for the amount of service retained and continued.'
33
34
While Otis was engaged in the performance of this contract, the United States, on the twelfth of November, 1878, directed him to transport mails which theretofore had been transferred, as required by the contract, 'from the New York city post-office to the Pennsylvania Railroad depot (foot of Cortlandt street) and back, fifty times per week,' across the Hudson river to the Pennsylvania Railroad depot at Jersey City, in the state of New Jersey. This service Otis performed from November 12, 1878, to July 1, 1881. The pro rata compensation for it, as also its reasonable value, is $ When the contract was executed, this extra service was being performed by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, under contract with the United States.
34
35
The item for the extra service between Station E and the Hudson River Railroad depot, $ and the item for the extra service between the foot of Cortlandt street and Jersey City, $ were allowed by the court of claims. The item for the extra service between the post-office and the Harlem Railroad depot, $ was disallowed.
35
36
No error is assigned by Otis as to the disallowance of the $ But the United States question the propriety of the allowance of the other two items. They contend that the 'eighteen round trips per week from Station E, No. Eighth avenue, to the Hudson River Railroad depot, Thirtieth street and Tenth avenue,' were mail-messenger service, under the contract for route No. and not, as held by the court of claims, mail-station service under the contract for route No. The argument is made that mailstation service, under the latter contract, comprehended only service between the city post-office and the stations or branch offices, and did not include service between a station or branch office and a railroad depot; and that the latter was mail-messenger service, and was governed by the terms of the contract for route No. which forbade extra compensation in regard to it. Although it does not appear by the record what points were designated in the advertisement or in the contract for route No. as those between which the mails were to be carried, the fair inference is that there was no specific designation which would include the trips between Station E and the Hudson River Railroad depot. The opinion of the court of claims says, on this subject, that this service was not 'named in the station contract, but that instrument provided that any increase in mail-station service should be paid for pro rata.' It held that the service was, on its face, station service, the mails being taken from a station. The mail-station service for which Otis proposed was designated, in his proposal, as 'between New York city post-office and branch offices,' and the 'mail-station service' named in the contract is referred to as that for which Otis proposed. Any increase in the service which might be ordered was to be paid for pro rata. The service in question was an increase in the service beyond that for which the $per annum was to be paid. The mail-messenger contract for route No. did not contemplate mail-station service, but only service between the main post-office and railroad stations and steam-boat landings. The $was accordingly properly allowed.
36
37
As to the extra service to Jersey City, under the contract for route No. the contract covered 54 trips per week from the New York city post-office to the Pennsylvania Railroad depot at Jersey City, and 27 trips per week from that depot to that post-office; and also 50 trips per week from that post-office to the Pennsylvania Railroad depot at the foot of Cortlandt street, and 50 trips per week from the latter depot to that post-office. The finding of the court of claims is that on each occasion of a trip under the item of 50 trips per week from the post-office to the depot at the foot of Cortlandt street and back, Otis was required, in addition, to carry the mails across the Hudson river, and did so. These trips were no portion of the trips contracted for from the post-office to the Pennsylvania Railroad depot at Jersey City and back. It is also found by the court of claims that, when the contract was executed, this extra service in regard to the 50 trips was being performed by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company under a contract with the United States. This extra service was not included in the routes designated in the contract.
37
38
The contract provides that Otis shall 'do and perform all other mail-messenger and transfer service now being performed in the said city of New York, and any and all new or additional mail messenger or transfer service in the said city, whether to and between depots and landings now established and those which may hereafter be established, which may become necessary and be required by the postmaster general during the time of this contract, without additional compensation.' There is this further provision: 'It is hereby stipulated and agreed that the postmaster general may, if it be required by the public interest, order new or additional service which may become necessary to be performed, which shall be performed without additional compensation.'
38
39
I is contended for the United States that, as Otis specifically agreed, in the contract, to carry the mails to the Pennsylvania Railroad depot at Jersey City 54 times, and back 27 times, each week, in addition to carrying them to Cortlandt street and back 50 times each week, the extra service across the river is 'new or additional service,' and so to be performed without additional compensation. But the fair construction of the two clauses of the contract, taken together, is that the new or additional service which is to be performed without additional compensation is new or additional service in the city of New York, as expressed in the first clause. Especially is this so as the contract specifically designates the 54 trips and the 27 trips as being to and from Jersey City, and then provides for 50 other trips to Cortlandt street and 50 back. Under those circumstances, the limitation of the new or additional service to be performed, without additional compensation, to such service in the city of New York, would be natural; service under the contract, and out of that city, and to Jersey City, being specially provided for in the case of mails deliverable at a depot of the Pennsylvania Railroad, at Jersey City, and service under the contract, and out of the city of New York, being also provided for in six other instances of delivery in Jersey City, and one in Hoboken, and one in Long Island City, at places to be reached only by ferries. Judgment affirmed.

v.
COOPER.
January 24, 1887.
1
In June, 1864, certain parcels of real estate in the county of Shelby, state of Tennessee, at that time the property of John C. Cooper, were sold by the United States tax commissioners for direct taxes, under the act of congress of August 5, 1861, and acts amendatory thereof. The taxes, including charges and commissions, amounted to $ The property was sold for $ The surplus, after payment of the taxes, charges, and commissions, was paid into the treasury of the United States. For this surplus, amounting to $ Cooper presented a claim to the secretary of the treasury in August, 1882, which was disallowed in April, 1884, and he thereupon brought this suit in the court of claims, and obtained a judgment for the amount, from which the United States have appealed.
1
2
The grounds of the appeal, as set forth by counsel of the government, are not sustained by the record. The court of claims found that, in 1865, t e claimant sold the property, subject to the tax title; and in 1882 released to the government, and those claiming under it, all his interest, to secure it against a second payment of the surplus. Upon these findings, counsel assume that the claimant retained possession of the property after the tax sale; and that he sold it to a third person for a valuable consideration, regardless of the sale and conveyance by the tax commissioners. But there was no evidence that the claimant was in possession, either at the time of the sale or afterwards; nor does it appear that the claimant ever asserted ownership over the property after the tax sale, and sold it, regardless of that sale, for a valuable consideration. His sale was made subject to the tax title, and could therefore have been of nothing more than his right to redeem the property from the tax sale, and the consideration paid is not stated. Of course, it is not necessary to consider the argument founded upon these assumed facts, however ingeniously framed, or however replete with learning.
2
3
The thirty-sixth section of the act of August 5, 1861, in prescribing the manner in which property subject to a direct tax shall be sold, where it is not divisible, so that by a sale of a part the whole amount of the tax, with costs, charges, and commissions, may be raised, provides that 'the surplus of the proceeds of the sale, after satisfying the tax, costs, charges, and commissions, shall be paid to the owner of the property, or his legal representatives; or if he or they cannot be found, or refuse to receive the same, then such surplus shall be deposited in the treasury of the United States, to be there held for the use of the owner or his legal representatives, until be or they shall make application therefor to the secretary of the treasury, who, upon such application, shall, by warrant on the treasury, cause the same to be paid to the applicant.' .
3
4
In U. S. v. Taylor, this section was the subject of consideration by this court; and it was held that it was not repealed by the act of June 7, 1862; that prior to the application of the owner for the surplus he has no claim therefor which can be enforced by suit against the United States; and that the statute of limitations begins to run against it only from the date of his application. This decision covers the present case. It is of no consequence to the government what the claimant did with his right of redemption. It was never exercised by him, or the purchaser from him, assuming that it could have been enforced, and the time for its assertion has long since elapsed. The United States did not guaranty the title it gave upon the tax sale; and it does not appear that the levy or the proceedings for the sale have ever been called in question. If the sale was for any reason invalid, and the United States could be held to indemnify the owner therefor, the release by his quitclaim of all interest in the property would secure the government against any claim on that account.
4
5
We see no valid ground for the refusal of the secretary of the treasury to comply with the command of the law, and pay to the claimant the money which the government has always held as trustee for him, and payable on his application. Judgment affirmed.

UNITED STATES
v.
SAUNDERS.
January 24, 1887.
1
Saunders, the appellee in this case, recovered against the United States in the court of claims a judgment for $ from which the United States appealed. The recovery was for the salary of the claimant as clerk of the committee on commerce of the house of representatives, from the fourteenth day of March, 1885, to the seventh day of January, 1886, at the rate of $per annum. Mr. Saunders held this place from the first day of July, 1884, when he was appointed, up to the seventh day of January, 1886, when his successor was appointed. He was paid the compensation up to the fourteenth of March, 1885, and for the time between that and the seventh of January, 1886, the comptroller refused to pay him. The various appropriation acts, including the one which would cover the period now in question, had all made appropriations for compensation for the clerk of the committee on commerce. The ground upon which payment is resisted by the United States is that the claimant was, on the fourteenth day of March, 1885, appointed a clerk in the office of the president of the United States, since which time he has continued to perform the duties of that office, and receive its salary. The comptroller, in his decision refusing to allow the claim, places his objection upon section Rev. St. U. S., and upon the opinion of Atty. Gen. Black, in regard to extra pay and double compensation, delivered in 1857. 9 Op. Attys. Gen. is found in immediate connection whth several other sections on the same subject, of which the two immediately preceding may be considered to some extent in pari materia. They are as follows:
1
 No person who holds an office, the salary or annual compensation attached to which amounts to the sum of two thousand five hundred dollars, shall receive compensation for discharging the duties of any other office, unless expressly authorized by law.
2
 No allowance or compensation shall be made to any officer or clerk, by reason of the discharge of duties which belong to any other officer or clerk in the same or any other department; and no allowance or compensation shall be made for any extra services whatever, which any officer or clerk may be required to perform, unless expressly authorized by law.
3
 No officer in any branch of the public service, or any other person whose salary, pay, or emoluments are fixed by law or regulations, shall receive any additional pay, extra allowance, or compensation, in any form whatever, for the disbursement of public money, or for any other service or duty whatever, unless the same is authorized by law, and the appropriation therefor explicitly states that it is for such additional pay, extra allowance, or compensation.'
4
5
Some stress is laid in the letter of the comptroller on the proposition that the clerkship to the committee is not an office in contemplation of the constitution of the United States and the law, and the decision in U. S. v. Germaine, is relied upon in support of that proposition. We do not think it important to decide in this case whether such a clerkship is an office within the meaning of these sections of the law and the constitution, because sections both include in their prohibition officers, clerks, and other persons. The proposition of the comptroller that the clerk is not an officer is made to meet his concession that a person who holds two distinct compatible offices may lawfully receive the salary of each.
5
6
The general question here raised has been much discussed in the opinions of the attorneys general, and in the decisions of this court. This section mainly relied upon by the government, is taken from two statutes, the first passed March 3, 1839, (5 St. at Large U. S. ) and the second, August 23, 1842, (5 St. at Large U. S. ) This opinion of Atty. Gen. Black seems to be in conflict with the principles laid down by his predecessors, and is materially modified, if not overruled, on the point mainly in question here, by his opinion in the Case of J. P. Brown, on page of the same volume. In Heiro's Case, 5 Op. Attys. Gen. Atty. Gen. Crittenden held that these two acts of 'were intended to fence against arbitrary extra allowances in each particular case, but not applying to distinct employments, with salaries affixed to each by law or regulation.'
6
7
The case before us comes within the terms of this language, which is further confirmed by the fact that he regarded the act of as prohibiting a person 'from receiving the salary of an office which he does not hold, and not against his receiving the salaries of two offices which he does legitimately hold;' and we do not see that there is any distinction between emoluments received for two distinct employments, whether offices or not, the salaries of which are distinct, and the services rendered distinct, both appointments being held by the same person, as in this case. We are of opinion that, taking these sections all together, the purpose of this legislation was to prevent a person holding an office or appointment, for which the law provides a definite compensation by way of salary or otherwise, which is intended to cover all the services which, as such officer, he may be called upon to render, from receiving extra compensation, additional allowances, or pay for other services which may be required of him either by act of congress or by order of the head of his department, or in any other mode, added to or connected with the regular duties of the place which he holds; but that they have no application to the case of two distinct offices, places, or employments, each of which has its own duties and its own compensation, which offices may both be held by one person at the same time. In the latter case he is, in the eye of the law. two officers, or holds two places or appointments, the functions of which are separate and distinct, and, according to all the decisions, he is in such case entitled to recover the two compensations. In the former case he performs the added duties under his appointment to a single place, and the statute has provided that he shall receive no additional compensation for that class of duties, unless it is so provided by special legislation. The case of U. S. v. Brindle, Sup. Ct. Rep. in which an Indian agent received large additional compensation for services connected with the sale of lands belonging to the Indians of his agency, which was affirmed in this court, was upon the ground that these additional services were performed for the benefit of the Indians, and the statute implied the payment of a reasonable compensation for such services. See, also, Converse v. U. S..

These views require the affirmance of the judgment of the court of claims, and it is so ordered.

CRESCENT CITY LIVE-STOCK LANDING & SLAUGHTER-HOUSE
CO. and another
v.
BUTCHERS' UNION SLAUGHTER-HOUSE & LIVE-STOCK LANDING CO.*
January 24, 1887.
1
This is a writ of error bringing into review a judgment of the supreme court of the state of Louisiana, reported in The federal question arising upon the record presented for our consideration is whether the supreme court of Louisiana, in its determination of the case, gave due effect to a certain decree of the circuit court of the United States for the Eastern district of Louisiana, in a previous litigation between the same parties. That question is presented upon the following case:
1
2
The plaintiff in error is a corporation created by the laws of Louisiana, which, by an act of the legislature of that state, passed March 8, 1869, was invested with the sole and exclusive privilege of conducting and carrying on the live-stock landing and slaughter-house business within the city of New Orleans, and the parishes of Orleans, Jefferson, and St. Bernard. The validity of this monopoly was sustained by the decision of this court in the Slaughter-house Cases, 16 Wall. 36, on the ground that this grant of exclusive right or privilege was a police regulation for the health and comfort of the people within the power of the state legislature, and not in violation of any provision of the constitution of the United States. The company continued thenceforward to use and enjoy its exclusive privileges until the adoption by the people of Louisiana of a new state constitution, in the year That constitution contained the following articles:
2
 The police juries of the several parishes, and the constituted authorities of all incorporated municipalities of the state, shall alone have the power of regulating the slaughtering of cattle and other live-stock within their respective limits: provided, no monopoly or exclusive privilege shall exist in this state, nor such business be restricted to the land or houses of any individual or corporation: provided, the ordinances designating places for slaughtering shall obtain the concurrent approval of the board of health or other sanitary organization.
3
 The mo opoly features in the charter of any corporation now existing in the state, save such as may be contained in the charters of railroad companies, are hereby abolished.'
4
5
The city of New Orleans, by ordinances adopted in 1881, proceeded to declare, under article of the constitution, within what limits in the parish of Orleans animals, intended for food, might be slaughtered, in which in the board of health of the state of Louisiana concurred. In March, 1880, the Butchers' Union Slaughter-house & Live-stock Landing Company, the defendant in error, became incorporated under the general law of Louisiana; and was authorized by its charter 'to erect, at any point or place in the parish of Orleans, wharves, stables, sheds, yards, and buildings necessary to land, stable, shelter, protect, and preserve all kinds of horses, mules, cattle, and other animals, for the purpose of carrying on the live-stock landing and slaughter-house business, and for the purpose of sheltering and protecting all such cattle or other animals which may be sent to said company destined for slaughter; and the said company shall, as soon as practicable, build and complete a slaughter-house; also a sufficient number of sheds and stables and other buildings as may be deemed necessary for the carrying on said slaughtering business.'
5
6
This company having begun to acquire the necessary plant for conducting the live-stock and slaughtering business, in pursuance of its charter, the plaintiff in error, on the twenty-third of November, 1881, filed its bill in the circuit court of the United States for the Eastern district of Louisiana against the defendant in error, setting up its exclusive right and privilege, as claimed by it under its original charter and grant, alleging that the defendant was about to violate the same, and praying for an injunction to restrain that company from carrying out its purpose. On the twenty-ninth of December, 1881, after notice and hearing, the judges of that court granted the injunction as prayed for, pendente lite. On final hearing, on the eighth of May, 1882, this injunction was made perpetual.1 On May 5, 1884, this decree of the circuit court was reversed by this court by a decision reported in Sup. Ct. Rep. on the ground that the exclusive right originally granted to the plaintiff in error was valid only as an exercise of the police power of the state, and was of that character, having reference to the public health, that it could not be made the subject of contract, protected against subsequent legislation by the constitution of the United States.
6
7
In granting the preliminary injunction referred to, the plaintiff in error was required to and gave an injunction bond in the sum of $ with Bertrand Saloy as surety, reciting the allowance of the injunction pendente lite, and conditioned to pay to the defendant in said injunction all such damages as it might suffer or had suffered in consequence thereof. The present action was begun in the civil district court for the parish of Orleans on May 28, 1884, by the defendant in error against the plaintiff in error and Bertrand Saloy, by a petition in which a recovery is sought upon the bond against the defendants in solido for the sum of $ with 5 per cent. interest from judicial demand, for a breach of its condition, and against the company alone for the further sum of $damages, with 5 per cent. interest from the date of the verdict, on the alleged ground of a malicious prosecution by the complainant therein of the said bill in equity for an injunction. This cause came on for trial by a jury, when there was a verdict against both defendants for $ with interest, and against the Crescent City Live-stock Landing & Slaughter-house Company alone, upon the plea of malicious prosecution, for the sum of $damages, and the further sum of $attorneys' fees. Upon the trial the defendant relied upon the decree of the circuit court of the Unite States, granting and perpetuating the injunction, as conclusive proof of probable cause for the institution and prosecution of the suit complained of. The rulings of the civil district court upon this defense are set out in several bills of exception. In one of them it appears that the judge left it to the jury to determine whether the decree of the circuit court constituted probable cause or not, adding that in his opinion it was both remarkable and extraordinary, and, as explanatory of that, the bill of exceptions signed by him contains the following statement: 'I described the action of the federal court as 'remarkable and extraordinary,' because it set at naught the decisions of the state courts of Louisiana, of the supreme court of Louisiana, set at defiance the positive mandate of the state constitution, and because it was held by the unanimous supreme court of the United States to have involved a usurpation of jurisdiction; such action was truly 'remarkable and extraordinary,' though not without deplorable precedent.'
7
8
It also appears that the defendants requested the judge to charge the jury as follows: 'A plaintiff whose asserted right was conferred by an act of legislature, and has been in force for a number of years, has a right to test the legality of a subsequent repeal of said right, when the validity of such repeal or modification has not been finally settled, and the plaintiff is advised by competent counsel that the repeal is invalid. In such a case the plaintiff has probable cause for asserting his rights, and instituting an action for such purpose. If, in the action instituted, the lower court being the circuit court of the United States, presided over by two judges, render a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, the existence of probable cause for instituting such suit is demonstrated by the finding of the judges of the circuit court, although their judgment was reversed on appeal.'
8
9
This charge the judge refused to give, on the ground that it was unsound in law. Judgment was rendered on the verdict, February 24, 1885, and the cause was removed by a suspensive appeal to the supreme court of Louisiana for the final decision of that court, by which, on December 14, 1885, it was affirmed.
9
10
It is contended by counsel for the defendant in error that, in examining the record in this case, this court will only consider the opinion and judgment of the supreme court of Louisiana in order to ascertain if the authority relied upon by the plaintiff in error was wrongfully disregarded by that tribunal, and that without reference to the rulings of the inferior court, the opinion of the supreme court being made a part of the record by law for that purpose. Such appears to be the law of Louisiana, as recognized by the decisions of this court. Code Pr. La. art. Parks v. Turner, 12 How. 43; Hennen, Dig. 92, No. 3; Cousin v. Blanc's Ex'rs, Grand Gulf R. & B. Co. v. Marshall, Murdock v. City of Memphis, Crossley v. City of New Orleans, Sup. Ct. Rep. Caperton v. Bowyer. 
10
11
It must therefore be conceded that the sole question to be determined is, did the supreme court of Louisiana, in deciding against the plaintiffs in error, give proper effect to the decree of the circuit court of the United States, subsequently reversed by this court?
11
12
It is argued by counsel for the defendant in error that this does not embrace any federal question; that the effect to be given to a judgment or decree of the circuit court of the United States sitting in Louisiana, by the courts of that state, is to be determined by the law of Louisiana, or by some principle of general law, as to which the decision of the state court is final; and that the ruling in question did not deprive the plaintiffs in error of 'any privilege or immunity specially set up or claimed under the constitution or laws of the United States.' But this is an error. The question whether a state court has given due effect to the judgment of a court of the United States is a question arising under the constitution and laws of the United States, and comes within the jurisdiction of the federal courts by proper process, although, as was said by this court in Dupasseur v. Rochereau, 'No higher sanctity or effect can be claimed for the judgment of the circuit court of the United States rendered in such a case, under such circumstances, than is due to the judgments of the state courts in a like case, and under similar circumstances.' Embry v. Palmer, Sup. Ct. Rep. 25. It may be conceded, then, that the judgments and decrees of the circuit court of the United States, sitting in a particular state, in the courts of that state, are to be accorded such effect, and such effect only, as would be accorded in similar circumstances to the judgments and decrees of a state tribunal of equal authority. But it is within the jurisdiction of this court to determine, in this case, whether such due effect has been given by the supreme court of Louisiana to the decrees of the circuit court of the United States here drawn in question.
12
13
The decree of the circuit court was relied upon in the state court as a complete defense to the action for malicious prosecution, on the ground that it was conclusive proof of probable cause. The supreme court of Louisiana, affirming the judgment of the inferior state court, denied to it, not only the effect claimed, but any effect whatever. It is conceded that, according to the law of Louisiana, the action for a malicious prosecution is founded on the same principles, and subject to the same defenses, as have been established by the common law prevailing in the other states.
13
14
In the case of Hubgh v. New Orleans & C. R. Co., it was said that 'the dispositions of article are found in the Roman and Spanish laws. So far from being new legislation, that article embodies a general principle as old as the science of jurisprudence itself, and it must still be understood with the limitations affixed to it by the jurisprudence of Rome and Spain. Domat Lois Civiles, tit. 'Dommages Causes par des Fautes,' p. ' In the same case the court said on a rehearing: 'The article of our Code provides that every act whatever of man that causes damage to another obliges him by whose fault it happened to repair it. The provisions of this article, however general and comprehensive its terms may be, may be found more than once recited in terms equally general and comprehensive in the laws of the fifteenth title of the seventh Partidas. The article was inserted in the Code of at a time when the Spanish laws were in force. It was put, and retained to this time, in the Code, not for the purpose of making any change in the law, but because it was a principle which was in its proper place in a code,—a principle which would be equally recognized as a necessary conservative element of society, and equally obligatory, whether it was formally enacted in a code or not.'
14
15
In the case of Senecal v. Smith, it had been previously decided that, 'in cases of this kind, it is well settled that malice and the want of probable cause in the original action are essential ingredients. Malice may be expressly proved, or it may be inferred from the total want of a probable cause of action; but malice alone, however great, if there be a probable cause upon which the suit or prosecution is based, is insufficient to maintain an action in damages for a malicious prosecution.'
15
16
In the case of Gould v. Gardner, 8 La. Ann. 11, it was determined that the defendants in the case were not without probable cause for the arrest of the plaintiff, which was the ground of the action, because they acted by the advice of eminent and learned counsel, though his opinion was held to be erroneous. The court refer to the case of Stone v. Swift, in Massachusetts, and that of Foshay v. Ferguson, in New York, as sufficient authority in support of their opinion, and add as follows: 'Our code and statutes have not provided any rules to guide us on the trial of such actions, and we are governed in the absence of positive legislation by the rules laid down in the authorities quoted, because we consider them just and reasonable in themselves.' In the opinion in the present case, the supreme court of Louisiana say that to sustain the charge of malicious prosecution it is necessary to show '(1) that the suit had terminated unfavorably to the prosecutor; (2) that in bringing it the prosecutor had acted without probable cause; (3) that he was actuated by legal malice, i. e., by improper or sinister motives. The above three elements must concur.' And, when there is no dispute of fact, the question of probable cause is a question of law, for the determination of the court. Stewart v. Sonneborn, Want of probable cause, and the existence of malice, either express or implied, must both concur to entitle the plaintiff in an action for a malicious prosecution to recover. So that, if probable cause is shown, the defense is perfect, notwithstanding the defendant in instituting and carrying on the action may have been actuated solely by a motive and intent of malice. If he had probable cause to institute his action, the motives by which he was actuated, and the purposes he had in view, are not material.
16
17
How much weight, as proof of probable cause, shall be attributed to the judgment of the court in the original action, when subsequently reversed for error, may admit of some question. It does not appear to have been judicially determined in Louisiana. In the case of Griffis v. Sellars, RUFFIN, C. J., said 'that probable cause is judicially ascertained by the verdict of the jury, and judgment of the court thereon, although upon an appeal a contrary verdict and judgment be given in a higher court.' In Whitney v. Peckham, such a judgment was held to be conclusive in favor of the existence of probable cause. To the same effect is Herman v. Brookerhoff, in an opinion of Chief Justice GIBSON. The decision in the case of Whitney v. Peckham, ubi supra, however, was questioned by the supreme court of New York in the case of Burt v. Place, where MARCY, J., delivering the opinion of the court, said that the Massachusetts decision rested entirely upon Reynolds v. Kennedy, which had been qualified by the decision of EYRE, baron of the exchequer, in Sutton v. Johnstone, and by what was said by Lord MANSFIELD and Lord LOUGHBOROUGH in the same case, which came before them on a writ of error. 
17
18
The effect of these English authorities, as stated by MARCY, J., in Burt v. Place, ubi supra, is as follows: 'That if it appears by the plaintiff's own declaration that the prosecution, which he charges to have been malicious, was before a tribunal having jurisdiction, and was there decided in favor of the plaintiff in that court, nothing appearing to fix on him any unfair means in conducting the suit, the court will regard the judgment in favor of the prosecution satisfactory evidence of probable cause.' In that case the judgment relied upon by the defendant was held not to be conclusive. The reason is stated to be as follows: 'Though the plaintiff admits in his declaration that the suits instituted before the magistrate by the defendant were decided against him, he sufficiently countervails the effect of that admission by alleging that the defendant, well knowing that he had no cause of action, and that the plaintiff had a full defense, prevented the plaintiff from procuring the necessary evidence to make out that defense by causing him to be detained a prisoner until the judgments were obtained, and by all ging that the imprisonment was for the very purpose of preventing a defense to the actions.'
18
19
Commenting on this case, the court of appeals of Kentucky in Spring v. Besore, say: 'The principle settled in the case last cited we understand to be that such a judgment will not, in every possible state of case, be deemed to be conclusive of the question of probable cause; but that, like judgments in other cases, its effect may be destroyed by showing that it was procured by fraud or other undue means.' That court proceeds to state the rule as follows: 'The correct doctrine on the subject is, in our opinion, that the decree or judgment in favor of the plaintiff, although it be afterwards reversed, is, in cases where the parties have appeared, and proof has been heard on both sides, conclusive evidence of probable cause, unless other matters be relied upon to impeach the judgment or decree, and show that it was obtained by fraud, and, in that case, it is indispensable that such matter should be alleged in the plaintiff's declaration, for unless it be done, as the other facts which have to be stated establish the existence of probable cause, the declaration is suicidal. The plaintiff's declaration will itself always furnish evidence of probable cause when it states, as it must do, the proceedings that have taken place in the suit alleged to be malicious, and shows that a judgment or decree has been rendered against the plaintiff. To counteract the effect of the judgment or decree, and the legal deduction of probable cause, it is incumbent upon him to make it appear in his declaration that such judgment or decree was unfairly obtained, and was the result of acts of malice, fraud, and oppression on the part of the defendant, designed and having the effect to deprive him of the opportunity and necessary means to have defeated the suit, and obtained a judgment in his favor.'
19
20
The limitations upon the general principle declared in Burt v. Place, ubi supra, were followed by the supreme court of Maine in Witham v. Gowen, and both decisions were referred to in the subsequent case of Payson v. Caswell, where the court said: 'In these two cases we have instances of exceptions to the general rule, indicative of the general nature of the characteristics which might be expected to attend them; but the rule itself remains unimpaired. If there be a conviction before a magistrate having jurisdiction of the subject-matter, not obtained by undue means, it will be conclusive evidence of probable cause.'
20
21
The propriety of this limitation of the rule seems to have been admitted by the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts in Bacon v. Towne, though in later cases it reiterated the broader rule, as originally stated in Whitney v. Peckham, ubi supra. Parker v. Huntington, 7 Gray, 36.
21
22
This seems to reconcile the apparent contradiction in the authorities, and states the rule, which we think to be well grounded in reason, fair and just to both parties, and consistent with the principle on which the action for malicious prosecution is founded.
22
23
It is, perhaps, not material in this case to define the rule with precision, and to attempt to state with accuracy the precise effect to be given to a judgment or decree of the court as proof of probable cause under all circumstances, because in the present case the decree of the circuit court of the United States was adjudged to be entitled to no effect whatever as evidence in support of the defense of the plaintiff in error. The ground on which the supreme court of Louisiana proceeded, as stated in its opinion, is explained to be as follows:
23
24
Shortly after the adoption of the constitution of the plaintiff in error instituted a suit in the state court of Louisiana, which was finally decided by the supreme court of the state in Crescent City, etc., Slaughter-house Co. v. City of New Orleans, The object of the suit was to obtain a writ of injunction 'restraining the city of New Orleans from entertaining any petitions for, and from ever designating any place or places for, the landing, yarding, sheltering, or slaughtering any animal or animals intended for human food in the parishes or Orleans, Jefferson, and St. Bernard, other than at the slaughter-houses and premises of the petitioner, and above the United States barracks on the east or left bank of the Mississippi river, and above the depot of Morgan's Louisiana & Texas Railroad, on the west or right bank or side of the Mississippi river.' There was a judgment dismissing the plaintiff's suit, and dissolving the injunction provisionally granted, from which the plaintiff appealed to the supreme court of Louisiana. That court affirmed the judgment, holding that the articles of the new constitution had destroyed the monopoly claimed by the plaintiff, and that this was a valid exercise of power on the part of the state of Louisiana, not in violation of any provision of the constitution of the United States. Speaking of the action of the present plaintiff in error in bringing that suit, the supreme court of Louisiana, in its opinion in the present case, () says: 'The questions involved were serious and important. Defendant's right to assert judicially the validity of his contract, and to resist by all legal remedies the execution of any state law which impaired it, was unquestioned. The question involved was federal in its nature, and the courts of the state, and perhaps of the United States, were equally open to it for the vindication of its alleged right; and, in either forum, it was entitled to appeal to the supreme court of the United States for the final and conclusive settlement of the question.' And, referring to the judgment in that suit, it also says: 'It is important to estimate the scope and effect of this decision. It was an authoritative judicial determination, by a competent court, of questions submitted to it at the instance of the company itself. In denying the rights claimed by the company, and in affirming the right of the city to regulate slaughtering within her limits, and to designate places for the conduct of such business, it necessarily affirmed the right of persons complying with such regulations to transact that business at such places, and denied the right of this company to interfere with them. If there was error in the decision, that error could be corrected by one tribunal only,—the supreme court of the United States. Until the questions involved had been determined differently by that high tribunal, the decision of this court was entitled to be accepted as the law by this litigant. Technical principles of lis pendens and res adjudicata might not debar the company from prosecuting another suit against a different party, involving the same subject-matter; but, if such suit rested exclusively upon the assertion of rights which this court had directly determined that the company did not possess, it could find no protection against the charge of being a malicious prosecution save in the production of a decision of the supreme court of the United States holding that our opinion was error.'
24
25
The following extracts from the same opinion are on the same point:
25
26
'We are bound to hold that there was entire absence of probable cause. The suit involved absolutely nothing but questions of law. Those identical questions had been submitted to this court by this very prosecutor, in a case precisely analogous, and had been determined against him. It was thus authoritatively advised what the law was. If it was dissatisfied with the opinion, its remedy was clear by appeal to the United States supreme court, and it had actually availed itself of that remedy on a writ of error which was pending and determined when this suit was brought. It must be carefully observed that, though the Butchers' Union Company was not technically a party to the suit against the city, the questions of right betw en it and the Crescent City Company were as directly involved as if it had been a party. If the city had the right to regulate slaughtering within her limits, and to designate places for its lawful conduct, obviously persons complying with such regulations had the right to transact the business. If she had not that right, no person could lawfully slaughter elsewhere than at the old company's slaughter-house. * * *
26
27
'But it is claimed that the prosecutor acted under the advice of counsel learned in the law. That is certainly true, and would ordinarily protect. But here the client was in possession of the opinion of this court on the very point in its own case, involving the same subject-matter. It had no need for advice of counsel. That advice was simply that the opinion of this court was error. Counsel had the undoubted right to entertain such opinion, and so to advise its client. The only lawful remedy under such advice consisted in an appeal to the United States supreme court. If it chose to act otherwise on such advice, it acted at its peril, and can take no protection therefrom. The only lawful action it could take under such advice had already been taken in the writ of error from the United States supreme court. * * *
27
28
'Nor does the decision of the judges of the circuit court of the United States afford a better shield. They are not vested with authority to review or reverse the decisions of this court. The effect of their action was not only to overrule our opinion, but practically to reverse our decree; for of what avail was the right decreed by us in favor of the city, to regulate slaughtering and to designate places therefor, if persons complying with those regulations could be enjoined by the United States circuit court from conducting the business at such places? It is obvious that the entire subject-matter of the injunction suit was embraced in and disposed of by our decree; and that, though the Butchers' Union Company was not nominally a party, its rights, and those of all persons, to transact the business of slaughtering in this city, being subsidiary to and springing directly from the right of the city, were necessarily involved in and protected by our decree. * * * But the ground on which we rest our conclusion on the question of probable cause is that our decree in the suit, to which the defendant corporation was a party, was, until reversed, the law to it so far as the subject-matter thereof is concerned; that the prosecution of a suit which had no foundation, except in the assumption that our decree was not law, was without probable cause; and that neither the advice of counsel, nor the opinions of judges of a co-ordinate court that our decree was error, could furnish any cause whatever for the prosecution of such suit.'
28
29
It is conceded by the supreme court of Louisiana, in this opinion, that its prior judgment in the case between the plaintiff in error and the city of New Orleans could not operate as an estoppel upon the principle of res judicata, in the suit which the plaintiff in error brought in the circuit court of the United States, the prosecution of which is charged against it as being malicious, because it was between different parties. It is also admitted that the judgment was not a final one, but, by reason of the federal question involved, was subject to review and possible reversal by a writ of error from the supreme court of the United States. The prosecution of such a writ of error, which was in fact actually sued out but subsequently dismissed, is declared by the supreme court of Louisiana to be the only lawful course which the plaintiff in error had a right to pursue. The failure to prosecute that writ of error is charged against the plaintiff in error, so as not only to deprive him of the benefit of the defense of probable cause, but as sufficient proof of malice in the subsequent institution of his suit in the circuit court of the United States; and these consequences, in the opinion of the supreme court f Louisiana, are not alleviated by the admitted fact that the plaintiff in error acted under the advice of counsel. Notwithstanding such advice, the client itself, the supreme court of Louisiana declared, was bound at its peril to take notice of its legal rights as defined in that opinion of the supreme court of the state. It is not shown in the present record on what grounds counsel proceeded in their advice, or the plaintiff in error in failing to prosecute the writ of error from that judgment. It will be observed that the only relief sought in that suit was a writ of injunction against the city of New Orleans from taking the preliminary steps under the ordinances of the city in reference to entertaining petitions, and designating places, for the prosecution of the business of which it claimed to have a monopoly under its charter.
29
30
In a similar case, Crescent City Live-stock Landing & Slaughter-house Co. v. Police Jury, decided by the supreme court of Louisiana, () the plaintiff, who is the plaintiff in error herein, sought to enjoin the defendant from granting permission to any one to establish a slaughter-house in the parish of Jefferson, on the ground that such a grant of authority would be in violation of the exclusive rights given to it under its charter,—a case precisely analogous to that between the plaintiff in error and the city of New Orleans, () In the case against the police jury of Jefferson parish, the appeal and the petition of the plaintiff were dismissed. In disposing of the case, the court say, (page ) 'The averments of the petition disclose a clear case of prematurity of complaint. It will be time enough for the plaintiff to apply for an injunction, upon a sworn averment of proper facts, if, after the police jury will have passed the resolution or given the permission, some party assumes to act upon that resolution and permission; for the determination of the motion to dismiss an opinion necessarily had to be expressed, not upon the merits, for none as yet exist, but upon the sufficiency of the sworn averment to justify the injunction.'
30
31
It might, therefore, on the authority of this decision of the supreme court of Louisiana, be argued that the expression of its opinion in the case of Crescent City, etc., Slaughter-house Co. v. City of New Orleans, was unnecessary to the decision of the cause, and obiter dictum, and, for aught that appears, counsel may have advised that a writ of error to reverse that judgment in the supreme court of the United States would fail on the ground that the record did not disclose the existence of a federal question necessarily to be passed on; for it has been the uniform doctrine of this court that where it appears that the judgment of the state court must be affirmed on other grounds disclosed in the record, it will not be reversed for an erroneous ruling of the state court on a federal question not necessary to the decision of the cause. Murdock v. Memphis, Jenkins v. Loewenthal, Sup. Ct. Rep. Erwin v. Lowry, Gibson v. Chouteau. 
31
32
However that may be, we are of the opinion, on other grounds, that the supreme court of Louisiana in this case erred in not giving due effect to the decree in question of the circuit court of the United States. The latter is a court co-ordinate to the supreme court of Louisiana in authority, and equal in dignity, being the highest federal court sitting in that state, whose judgments and decrees are final and conclusive, subject only to review and reversal in the supreme court of the United States. In the case in which the decree complained of was pronounced the circuit court did not act without jurisdiction, the subject-matter of the suit being a controversy arising under the constituion of the United States. The argument of the counsel for the defendant in error to the contrary, which deduces hat the judge of the inferior court in his charge to the jury alleged to be a usurpation of jurisdiction, merely from the fact that its decree was reversed by this court, could only be true if the general proposition were true that all judgments reversible for error are void for want of jurisdiction. Having jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject-matter of the suit, the judges of the circuit court were bound to declare the law of the case between the parties in the light of their own convictions, and under a sense of their official responsibilities, not being under any legal obligation to regard the decision of the supreme court of Louisiana upon a question of federal law as controlling by reason of its authority, whatever respect and deference they might see fit to accord to it by way of persuasion and argument. And their judgment or decree, when rendered, is binding and perfect between the parties until reversed, without regard to any adverse opinion or judgment of any other court of merely concurrent jurisdiction. Its integrity, its validity, and its effect are complete in all respects, between all parties in every suit, and in every forum, where it is legitimately produced as the foundation of an action, or of a defense, either by plea or in proof, as it would be in any other circumstances. While it remains in force it determines the rights of the parties between themselves, and may be carried into execution in due course of law to its full extent, furnishing a complete protection to all who act in compliance with its mandate, and, even after reversal, it still remains, as in the case of every other judgment or decree in like circumstances, sufficient evidence in favor of the plaintiff who instituted the suit or action in which it is rendered, when sued for a malicious prosecution, that he had probable cause for his proceeding.
32
33
Neither was there anything in the situation or conduct of the plaintiff in error that could deprive it of the protection of the decree of the circuit court of the United States in this action. The fact that it had exercised an election to bring its suit against the city of New Orleans in the state court could have no legal effect upon its right afterwards to bring a similar suit against other parties in the circuit court of the United States. Its right of choice was not exhausted by a single exercise, and justified it in subsequently invoking the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, no matter with what motive or for what purpose. As we have already seen and declared, the existence of express malice, however flagrant or unjustifiable, could not affect the exercise of this right, or deprive the party of the benefit of the judgment of the court as proof of a probable cause for the institution of the suit. Neither was the plaintiff in error bound to reject the advice of its counsel on the ground of its own presumed knowledge of the law, as declared in the opinion of the supreme court of Louisiana in the prior suit. It had a right to test the soundness of that judgment by seeking the jurisdiction of a co-ordinate court, whose decision would be of equal authority and dignity with that of the supreme court of the state, both being final between the parties to the particular litigation until reversed by the supreme court of the United States. The plaintiff in error owed no allegiance to the courts of the state greater than that due to the courts of the United States. It had an equal right in both to vindicate what it claimed to be its rights, by remedies appropriate to that purpose, and against all parties infringing them. The fact that the supreme court of Louisiana had spoken first gave no additional weight to its decision. Whatever deference may be due to the decisions of the state court of final resort in every case in which it has spoken, and whatever may be the respect to which its decisions upon questions of purely local law established as rules of property may be entitled, they are not authority binding upon the courts of the United States, sitting even in the same state, where the questions involved and decided relate to rights arising under the constitution and laws of the United States.
33
34
But the rule in question, which declares that the judgment or decree of a court having jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject-matter, in favor of the plaintiff, is sufficient evidence of probable cause for its institution, although subsequently reversed by an appellate tribunal, was not established out of any special regard to the person of the party. As we have already seen, it will avail him as a complete defense in an action for a malicious prosecution, although it may appear that he brought his suit maliciously, for the mere purpose of vexing, harassing, and injuring his adversary. The rule is founded on deeper grounds of public policy, in vindication of the dignity and authority of judicial tribunals constituted for the purpose of administering justice according to law, and in order that their judgments and decrees may be invested with that force and sanctity which shall be a shield and protection to all parties and persons in privity with them. The rule, therefore, has respect to the court and to its judgment, and not to the parties, and no misconduct or demerit on their part, except fraud in procuring the judgment itself, can be permitted to detract from its force. It is equally true and equally well settled in the foundations of the law that neither misconduct nor demerit can be imputed to the court itself. It is an invincible presumption of the law that the judicial tribunal, acting within its jurisdiction, has acted impartially and honestly. The record of its proceedings imports verity; its judgments cannot be impugned except by direct process from superior authority. The integrity and value of the judicial system, as an institution for the administration of public and private justice, rests largely upon this wholesome principle. That principle has been disregarded in the present case by the supreme court of Louisiana in failing to give due effect to the decree of the circuit court of the United States as sufficient evidence in support of the defense of the plaintiff in error in this action, so far as it is an action for the recovery of damages for a malicious prosecution.
34
35
The judgment of the supreme court of Louisiana on the bond itself, for damages occasioned by its breach, against the principal and surety, is not attacked in this proceeding. It is so far affirmed. But that part which constitutes a judgment against the Crescent City Live-stock Landing & Slaughter-house Company solely, for damages for the malicious prosecution, is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings therein not inconsistent with this opinion; and it is so ordered.

LITTLE ROCK & FT. S. RY.
v.
HUNTINGTON and another, Trustees, etc.1
January 24, 1887.
1
The Little Rock & Fort Smith Railway is a corporation organized under the laws of Arkansas, and the defendants are citizens of Massachusetts, and trustees under a mortgage or deed of trust executed to them by the corporation on the nineteenth of December, 1874. The bill is filed to enforce the performance of certain trusts devolving upon the defendants under that instrument.
1
2
By the act of congress of July 28, 1866, a grant of land was made to the state of Arkansas, to aid in the construction of a railroad from Little Rock to Fort Smith. The grant was of 10 alternate sections of land on each side of the road, with a right of way over land of the United States to the width of feet. By legislation of Arkansas in 1869 the right to the lands thus granted by congress became vested in the Little Rock & Fort Smith Railway Company. In December following, that corporation executed a mortgage upon its road, equipments, franchises, and property, to secure its bonds to be issued thereunder to the amount of $ and, in June, 1870, it executed a second mortgage upon the same property to secure its bonds to be issued to the amount of $ The bonds were issued, but the compan defaulted in their payment, and both mortgages were foreclosed, and the property was sold under a decree of the circuit court of the United States for the Eastern district of Arkansas. The purchasers at such sale, under a statute of Arkansas, organized themselves into a corporation, and adopted as their corporate name that of the Little Rock & Fort Smith Railway, and became vested with all the rights, privileges, powers, and franchises of the former corporation, together with the lands granted to that company by the acts of congress and of the legislature of Arkansas. This new company, the plaintiff herein, in order to provide means for the completion and equipment of its road, and for other purposes, issued and negotiated a series of bonds, amounting in the aggregate to $ payable to bearer at the end of 30 years from January 1, 1874, with interest coupons payable semi-annually at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum, fee from any United States tax. The bonds were issued in denominations of $each, from No. inclusive, and in denominations of $each, from Nos. inclusive. To secure their payment, principal and interest, the company executed a mortgage or deed of trust, bearing date December 19, 1874, upon its road, franchises, rights, and lands, to the defendants, Huntington and Ripley, in trust, among other things, to apply the moneys arising from the lands of the company, after deducting the expenses of executing the trust, as follows: (1) To the payment of the coupons or interest warrants attached to the bonds as fast as they shall become due and payable, to the extent that the net earnings from the business of the road shall be insufficient for that purpose; (2) to the purchasing and canceling of such outstanding bonds as can be obtained, at their market value, not exceeding, however, a premium of 10 per cent.; and (3) to the payment of such of the bonds as shall not have been purchased in accordance with these provisions, when the same shall become due and payable. All the trust moneys coming to the trustees, not applied or used in accordance with the above provisions, were to be invested in United States securities, or lent, from time to time, in such manner as by the law of Massachusetts is permitted, to savings banks. The interest derived from such investments or loans was to be applied by the trustees to the payment of the bonds or coupons.
2
3
The bill alleges that, after the execution of this mortgage, the company completed its railroad from Little Rock to Fort Smith, within the time and in the manner required by the acts of congress and of Arkansas, and thereby became the owner of acres of land, as certified by the secretary of the interior to the state, all of which, and the proceeds of sales, were subject to the trusts and charges imposed by the mortgage or deed of trust; that the corporation has disposed of all the bonds authorized to be issued under the mortgage, but that of the lands there still remain unsold acres; that, during the years and the first six months of the year the net earnings derived from the operation of the road, even when united with the proceeds of the sales of lands, were insufficient to meet the coupons or interest warrants attached to the bonds maturing on January 1, 1878, July 1, 1878, January 1, 1879, July 1, 1879, and January 1, 1880; and thereupon an agreement was made, between the corporation and the holders of the bonds and coupons payable on those dates, by which the holders surrendered to the defendants, trustees, the coupons, and the corporation issued to them negotiable scrip or certificates, by which it promised to pay the trustees, or bearer, the amount of the coupons surrendered, in 10 years from their maturity, with interest at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum, payable semi-annually, the corporation reserving the right to pay the scrip and interest at any time previous to its maturity. The scip or certificate als provided that the trustees should hold the coupons surrendered as collateral security for the payment of the scrip thus issued therefor, and that the coupons should not be surrendered or canceled until the scrip should be paid. The coupons maturing on July 1, 1883, and January 1, 1884, were also unpaid, and a similar arrangement was made with the holders of these coupons by the issue of scrip for them; so that the whole amount of scrip issued for coupons thus unpaid was $ The bill also alleges that out of the moneys received from the sale of the lands since the execution of the mortgage the trustees have bought and canceled bonds amounting to $ besides appropriating moneys to aid the corporation in paying the interest coupons attached to the bonds; that since the year the trustees have applied the net proceeds of the sales to the purchase and cancellation of the bonds, and no part thereof to the purchase and cancellation of the said scrip, or the coupons held by them as collateral security for the payment of that scrip; that for several years the net earnings of the road have been more than sufficient to enable the corporation to pay its current coupons and the interest upon the scrip; that the corporation has notified the trustees that it was no longer necessary to retain any portion of the proceeds of sales for the payment of the interest coupons to mature hereafter; that the net earnings of the road would, in all probability, be ample for that purpose, and, by reason of the increased earnings, will continue to be more than ample to pay the coupons as they severally become due and payable; and that the price of the bonds has greatly risen in value, and the premium thereon has varied the past year from 13 to 17 per cent., so that under the mortgage the trustees are no longer able to purchase such bonds, being limited by the mortgage to the payment of 10 per cent. premium. The bill also alleges that acres of the lands of the company remain unsold; that the trustees hold contracts for lands sold upon which partial payments have been made, but upon which deeds are not to be executed until the purchase money and interest are fully paid, amounting in the aggregate to more than the sum of $ and that, in the ordinary course of business, the trustees and their successors will have large amounts of money from sales thereof, which must be applied by them in accordance with the provisions of the mortgage, and in the order of priority, before the moneys can be invested as provided therein; that the trustees have refused to apply any of the said money to the payment of the outstanding coupons for which the scrip mentioned was given; that such coupons draw interest at the rate of 7 per cent., and any investment of such moneys by the trustees can only be made so as to obtain a much smaller rate of interest, and that, therefore, it would be greatly to the advantage of the corporation and to the bondholders that such moneys should be applied to taking up the outstanding coupons. The trustees, in their answer to the demand of the corporation that the moneys be so applied, have expressed a willingness to so apply them; but they entertain doubts as to their authority so to do, unless directed by order of the court.
3
4
The mortgage, as is seen by its terms, contemplates that the proceeds of sales of lands shall be applied to the payment of the interest coupons to the extent that the earnings of the road are insufficient for that purpose. The contract by which the time to pay those coupons for which the scrip was issued was extended for 10 years, does not release the corporation from its obligation, provided it is in funds from the earnings of the road and the sales of its lands. The coupons are not canceled, but are still held as collateral security for the scrip issued. The inability of the company to pay such coupons from the earnings of the road, combined with the proceeds of the sales of the lands, which led to the contract for the scrip, no lenger exists, and there is no legal impediment in the way of the trustees taking up such coupons, notwithstanding the contract deferring their compulsory payment for 10 years. The money received from the sales of the lands cannot be used in purchasing the bonds of the company which are now at more than 10 per cent. premium, and the trustees are restricted in their payment to that premium. Any investment under the law of Massachusetts would bring them only a moderate interest, probably not exceeding 4 per cent. The coupons draw 7 per cent. There is therefore a manifest propriety and justice in the demand of the corporation that the surplus money from the sales of its lands, instead of being thus invested, should be applied to taking up the outstanding coupons. And it is the plain duty of the trustees, in the execution of their trust, to make the proceeds of the sales of lands as available as possible for the extinction of the indebtedness of the corporation,—first on its coupons, and then upon its bonds, so long as the same can be bought at a premium not exceeding 10 per cent.

5
The decree of the court is therefore reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to enter a decree in accordance with this opinion.

=======================================================

120 U.S. 287
MEMPHIS & L. R. R. Co. (as reorganized)
v.
Dow and others, Trustees.1
January 24, 1887.
1
From these facts it appears that at the date of the mortgage of May 2, 1877, appellant's entire assets consisted of the property, rights, and privileges purchased by Pierson, Dow, and Matthews, trustees, at the sale under the decree foreclosing the mortgage of December 1, 1873, and by them conveyed to it, on the express condition that the beneficial owners should receive therefor, besides $in stock, its mortgage bonds for $ That amount, in the stock and bonds of the appellant, was the valuation placed by such owners upon their interests, after taking into account as well the amount previously expended in the construction and maintenance of the road as the probable value, in the future, of the stock and bonds to be given for a surrender of those interests. The transaction was, in its essence, a purchase of said property, rights, and privileges by the appellant at an agreed price, to be paid in its stock and bonds. A part of the price was paid when the $of stock was issued. But appellant disputes its liability upon the bonds given for the balance upon the theory that they were prohibited from issuing them by the eighth section of the twelfth article of the constitution of Arkansas, adopted in 1874. That section provides that 'no private corporation shall issue stocks or bonds, except for money or property actually received, or labor done, and all fictitious increase of stock or indebtedness shall be void.' In support of this view, our attention is called to the fact, admitted by the demurrer, that the full value of the property, rights, and privileges conveyed to appellant did not xceed $ the amount at which the capital stock was fixed; and, consequently, it is argued, the $of bonds were issued without any consideration received in money, property, or labor, and represented only a fictitious indebtedness. In other words, appellant's vendors were fully compensated for their interests by taking to themselves its entire stock.
1
2
We do not concur in this view of the case. It does not, we think, rest upon a sound interpretation of the state constitution. The prohibition against the issuing of stock or bonds, except for money or property actually received or labor done, and against the fictitious increase of stock or indebtedness, was intended to protect stockholders against spoliation, and to guard the public against securities that were absolutely worthless. One of the mischiefs sought to be remedied is the flooding of the market with stock and bonds that do not represent anything whatever of substantial value. In reference to a provision in the constitution of Illinois, adopted in 1870, containing a prohibition as to railroad corporations similar to that imposed by the Arkansas constitution upon all private corporations, the supreme court of the former state, in Peoria & S. R. Co. v. Thompson, said: 'The latter part of the clause of the constitution in question, which declares that 'all stocks, dividends, and other fictitious increase of the capital stock or indebtedness of such corporation shall be void,' we think clearly points out the chief object which the constitutional convention sought to accomplish in adopting it; and to this we must look, in a large degree, for a solution of the language which precedes. The object was, doubtless, to prevent reckless and unscrupulous speculators, under the guise or pretense of building a railroad or of accomplishing some other legitimate corporate purpose, from fraudulently issuing and putting upon the market bonds or stocks that do not and are not intended to represent money or property of any kind, either in possession or expectancy, the stock or bonds in such case being entirely fictitious. * * * Under this provision of the constitution, railroad companies have no right to lend, give away, or sell on credit their bonds or stock, nor have they the right to dispose of either except for a present consideration, and for a corporate purpose.'
2
3
Recurring to the language employed in the Arkansas constitution, we are of opinion that it does not necessarily indicate a purpose to make the validity of every issue of stock or bonds by a private corporation depend upon the inquiry whether the money, property, or labor actually received therefor was of equal value in the market with the stock or bonds so issued. It is not clear, from the words used, that the framers of that instrument intended to restrict private corporations—at least when acting with the approval of their stockholders—in the exchange of their stock or bonds for money, property, or labor, upon such terms as they deem proper: provided, always, the transaction is a real one, based upon a present consideration, and having reference to legitimate corporate purposes, and is not a mere device to evade the law, and accomplish that which is forbidden. We cannot suppose that the scheme whereby the appellant acquired the property, rights, and privileges in question, for a given amount of its stock and bonds, falls within the prohibition of the state constitution. The beneficial owners of such interests had the right to fix the terms upon which they would surrender those interests to the corporation of which they were to be the sole stockholders. And, that subsequent holders of stock might not be misled, each certificate of stock states upon its face that 'the holder takes this stock subject to $of mortgage bonds of the company, which are secured by two mortgages duly recorded.' All that was done was to reorganize the Little Rock & Memphis Railroad Company upon the same basis, substantially, as to capital stock an bonded indebtedness, as existed, in respect to these properties, rights, and privileges, before the adoption of the state constitution, and while they were held and controlled by the companies which preceded the appellant in the ownership. There was, consequently, no fictitious increase by appellant of its stock or indebtedness. Under these circumstances, it cannot be fairly said that the bonds secured by the mortgage were issued without any consideration whatever actually received in property.
3
4
Equally untenable is the position that the bonds were void because made to bear interest at a rate in excess of that specified in the act of January 22, 1885, now section of the Revised Statutes of Arkansas. Mansf. Dig. Ark. The seventh section of that act provides that 'whenever any railroad company heretofore or hereafter incorporated in this state shall, in the opinion of the directors thereof, require an increased amount of the capital stock, they shall, if authorized by the holders of a majority of the stock, be, and they are hereby, authorized to increase their capital stock to any amount not exceeding the estimated cost of their road, and shall have power to borrow money on the credit of the corporation, not exceeding its authorized capital stock, at a rate of interest not exceeding seven per cent. per annum, and may execute its bonds therefor in sums of five hundred dollars or one thousand dollars; and to secure payment thereof may pledge the property, both real and personal, and the income of said company, and to secure the payment thereof may execute a deed of mortgage or other instrument of writing; and such company are hereby authorized to sell, negotiate, pledge, or mortgage such bonds for the benefit of such company, and on such terms and at such places, either within or without this state, and at such rates and at such prices as, in the opinion of such directors, will best advance the interests of such company; and if said bonds are thus sold bona fide, at a discount, such sale shall be valid in every respect, and such securities as binding for the respective amounts thereof as if sold at their par value.'
4
5
It is sufficient to say that this statute has no application to the present case; for there was here no increase of the existing capital stock of a corporation, nor were the bonds secured by the mortgage of May 2, 1877, executed for money borrowed, but for property, rights, and privileges conveyed to appellant at an agreed price, to be paid in its stock and bonds.
5
6
It results from what has been said that the validity of the bonds cannot be disputed upon any of the grounds stated. Neither the constitution nor the statutes of Arkansas interpose any obstacle to the full performance by the appellant of the terms and conditions upon which only it acquired the ownership of the interests in question.
6
7
The appellant, in the mortgage to the appellees, covenanted that the interests conveyed were free from incumbrances, and that it would warrant and defend the title against all lawful claims whatsoever. Its duty, therefore, was to protect those interests against prior liens. Appellant having neglected to perform that duty, the appellees, as junior incumbrancers, had the right to protect the mortgaged estate against a forced sale. Upon payment of the amount due the state, they became entitled to the benefit of her lien upon the property. Although the appellees did not purchase the state's claim, or become, technically, the assignee thereof, her lien will be regarded, in equity, as subsisting, so far as is necessary for their protection.
7
8
In behalf of the appellant it is contended that the decree below went beyond what was required for the indemnification of the appellees. The debt due the state, by the terms of her contract with the old company, bore interest at the rate of eight per cent. per annum until paid. The entire claim, with interest at that rate, was paid by the appellees. But the decree below gave a lien, as against the ppellant, for the amount so paid, with interest from the date of such payment at the same rate as was stipulated in the contract between the state and her debtor. The constitution of Arkansas provides that 'all contracts for a greater rate of interest than ten per centum per annum shall be void as to principal and interest, and the general assembly shall prohibit the same by law; but, when no rate of interest is agreed upon, the rate shall be six per centum per annum.' Article 19, § 13. And by statute it is provided that 'judgments or decrees, upon contracts bearing more than six per cent. interest, shall bear the same interest as may be specified in such contracts, and the rate of interest shall be expressed in all such judgments and decrees; and all other judgments and decrees shall bear interest at the rate of six per cent. per annum until satisfaction is made as aforesaid.'
8
9
The right of subrogation is not founded on contract. It is a creature of equity; is enforced solely for the purpose of accomplishing the ends of substantial justice; and is independent of any contractual relations between the parties. All that the appellees can, in good conscience, demand, is reimbursement for their outlay in protecting the mortgaged property against the prior lien of the state. When relief to that extent is accorded, they will have no just ground to complain, especially as the debt held by the state was not the personal debt of the appellant. There was no agreement between them and the appellant in respect to interest upon any sum they might be compelled to pay in order to relieve the property from prior incumbrances. It, therefore, they are adjudged to have a lien upon the mortgaged property for the whole amount actually paid to the state, with interest thereon from the date of such payment, at the rate established by law in the absence of an agreement as to rate, they will be fully indemnified. It is not for the court or for parties to say that the rate of interest fixed by law, in the absence of an agreement, is not adequate compensation for delay in the payment of money. It results that the decree, so far as it allows to appellees interest in excess of 6 per cent. per annum on the aggregate amount of principal and interest paid by them to the state, is erroneous.

10
One other question remains to be determined. The appellant insists that the court below erred in giving judgment against it for $ the amount found to be due the appellees for services and counsel fees herein, and for costs paid out by the appellees in this suit. We are of opinion that the decree in this respect was right. This allowance, as to its amount, is fully sustained by the evidence in the cause. And it is authorized by that clause and condition in the mortgage of May 2, 1877, which provides that the appellant 'will, from time to time, as incurred, pay all charges, costs, and expenses' of the appellees, or either of them, 'in and about the execution of the trust,' and 'will indemnify and hold harmless' the appellees 'against all costs, charges, damages, and expenses which they or either of them may sustain or be put to in consequence of accepting this trust, or of anything which may be done or omitted to be done under it, saving only such damages as may be incurred by or arise from the culpable act or neglect' of said appellees.
10
11
The decree below is reversed, so far as it gives the appellees interest upon the aggregate amount paid by them into the treasury of the state, at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum from the time of such payment; and the cause is remanded, with directions to allow interest upon that amount from the date of payment, at the rate only of 6 per cent. per annum. In all other respects the decree is affirmed. The appellant will have its costs in this court.

HIBERNIA INS. CO.
v.
ST. LOUIS & N. O. TRANSP. CO. and another.1
January 31, 1887.
1
This is a suit in equity, brought in the circuit court of the United States for the Eastern district of Missouri, by the Hibernia Insurance Company, a Louisiana corporation, against the St. Louis & New Orleans Transportation Company and the Babbage Transportation Company, two Missouri corporations, and Henry Lowery, a citizen of Missouri. The bill alleges that in August, 1879, the Babbage Company, of which Lowery was president and director, being engaged in transporting merchandise for hire on the Mississippi river from St. Louis to New Orleans, by means of certain steam tow-boats and barges which it owned, contracted with the firm of Gordon & Gomila to transport for it from St. Louis to New Orleans a quantity of wheat, 'the dangers of the river, fire and collision only excepted;' that it loaded a part of the wheat on the barge Sallie Pearce, which it took in two by its tow-boat John Means; and that, by negligent navigation on the part of the Babbage Company, the barge broke away from the tow-boat, and was allowed to drift down the river until she brought up aa inst a steam-boat which was lying at rest along the bank on the Missouri side of the river, and was broken and crushed, so that some of the wheat was lost in the river and some of it was damaged by water. The bill also alleges that in September, 1879, one Pleasants owned certain rye, corn, oats, and hay, which were at St. Louis, on the barge Colossal; that the Babbage Company contracted with Pleasants to carry those goods on that barge from St. Louis to New Orleans, 'the dangers of navigation, fire, explosion, collision, bridges, and all other known and unknown obstructions excepted;' and that the company, by its tow-boat E. M. Norton, took the barge in tow, and the tow-boat was so negligently managed that she drew the barge against an obstruction then visible and known to the master, pilot, and officers of the tow-boat, and the barge was broken, and allowed by them or remain, without any attempt to rescue the goods, and nearly all of them were lost. The bill also alleges that the plaintiff, as insurer of the goods in both cases, paid to Gordon & Gomila and Pleasants $ The bill also alleges that in January, 1880, the Babbage Company, by Lowery, as its president, sold all its property, consisting of four steam tow-boats and thirteen barges, to the St. Louis Company; that such sale was without consideration, and fraudulent as against the rights of the plaintiff as a creditor of the Babbage Company, and that Lowery and the St. Louis Company had notice of the fraud. The bill waives an answer on oath, and prays that the court will decree payment of said debt to the plaintiff, with interest; that the St. Louis Company be restrained from disposing of any of said property until the plaintiff's debt shall be paid; and that until that time the plaintiff have a lien on said property.

The defendants demurred to the bill for want of equity, for want of privity between the plaintiff and the defendants, and for multifariousness. The court (McCrary, dismissed the bill as to Lowery, and overruled the demurrer as to the other defendants, with leave to them to answer, holding that it was not necessary that the plaintiff should recover a judgment at law against the Babbage Company before bringing the suit. The defendants then put in a plea to that part of the bill which relates to the transfer of the property, and ask for relief by a lien and an injunction, denying the fraud, and alleging the bona fides of the transaction. They, at the same time, put in an answer to the part of the bill not covered by the plea, denying the negligence, and averring that the losses were due to the perils of navigation. There were special replications to the plea and the answer. Proofs being taken on the plea, the court (McCrary, overruled it, on a hearing, holding that the allegations of the bill involved in the plea were established, and that the debts of the Babbage Company could be enforced in equity against the other company to the extent of the property received by the latter. The case was afterwards brought to a hearing on proofs on the issues raised by the answer, and the court (McCrary, dismissed the bill. The plaintiff has appealed. The circuit court held, as to the Sallie Pearce, that the contract was that of a common carrier; that, as to the Colossal, it was immaterial whether the contracts was that of towage merely, or that of a common carrier; and that each disaster was caused by an inevitable accident, falling within the excepted dangers of the river and of navigation, alleged in the bill as forming part of each contract. We concur in this conclusion. In the first case a sand reef had been recently formed in the channel. The pilot of the tow-boat had no reason to suppose it was there; and she was being handled with skill and care when the accident occurred. In the second case, the Colossal was unseaworthy when she started. The tow-boat was prudently navigated, but the river bank had shortly before caved in, n d a tree from the land had fallen into the river, its presence being unknown, and the Colossal struck it under water, causing the accident, there being no want of care, skill, or attention on the part of those in charge of the tow-boat, either before or after the occurrence, in regard to the navigation or the saving of the cargo of the Colossal.

The appellees have contended in this court that the rulings of the circuit court as to the demurrer and the plea were erroneous; but, without passing on those questions, we affirm the decree, for the reason stated.

UNITED STATES
v.
HILL and another.1
January 31, 1887.
1
On the fifth of February, 1879, Clement Hugh Hill was duly appointed clerk of the district court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts, by the judge of that court. On the same day he and William Goodwin Russell and another person executed a joint and several bond to the United States in the penal sum of $ conditioned that Hill, 'by himself and by his deputies,' should 'faithfully discharge the duties of his office, and seasonably record the decrees, judgments, and determinations of the said court, and properly account for all moneys coming into his hands, as required by law.' The statute requiring a bond, in force at the time, was section 3 of the act of February ) which required the clerk to give a bond, with sureties, 'faithfully to discharge the duties of his office, and seasonably to record the decrees, judgments, and determinations of the court of which he is clerk.' This suit was brought by the United States against Hill and Russell on said bond by a writ, dated December 4, 1884, claiming $damages. The declaration alleges, as a breach of the bond, that Hill 'has not properly accounted for all moneys coming into his hands, as required by law, according to the condition of said bond.' The answer of the defendants denies that allegation, and avers that Hill 'has made full and sufficient returns of all moneys received by him, as required by law, and that he owes no sum of money to the said United States.'

2
The following agreed statement of facts was filed July 1, 1885, signed by the attorneys for the respective parties, and upon it the case was, by written agreement, submitted to the decision of the court: 'The defendant Hill was appointed clerk of said court on the fifth day of February, 1879, and duly qualified as clerk, and the defendants gave the bond, a copy of which is annexed to the declaration. As clerk he has made half-yearly returns of fees and emoluments received by him; but he has not included in the same the amounts received by him for the naturalization of aliens in the district court. It has been the custom in the United States courts in the district of Massachusetts for a long time, not less than forty-five years before the date of the writ in the present action, and known and approved by the judges, for the clerk to charge one dollar as a fee for a declaration of intention to become a citizen, and two dollars as a fee for a final naturalization and certificate thereof; and the clerk of the district court has never included these in the fees and emoluments returned by him, and this has been known to the judges to whom the accounts have been semi-annually exhibited, and by whom they were passed without objection in this particular. Following this custom, and believing and being informed that these fees formed no part of the emoluments to be returned to the government, the defendant Hill has not included these amounts in his accounts, and this was known to the judge when the accounts were examined, and he made on each a certificate in the form hereto annexed; and his accounts, so made out, up to July 1, 1884, have been examined and adjusted by the accounting officers of the treasury department. The clerks of the several courts of the state of Massachusetts made similar charges for like services, and made no return to the treasurers of the counties of the fees so received until the passage of the statute of the state of If, upon the facts before stated and agreed, the court shall be of opinion that the said fees, charged by the defendant Hill, in respect to naturalizations, or any part thereof, should have been returned in his accounts to the United States as part of the emoluments of the clerk, from which his compensation is to be taken in accordance with section of the Revised Statutes, and that the settlements and adjustments of his several accounts, as above mentioned constitute no defense to this action, the case shall be sent to an assessor to ascertain the amount due the United States, in accordance with the law as laid down by the court, unless the parties shall, within fifteen days after the announcement of the opinion of the court, agree upon the amount. The blanks used for the report of clerks' fees and emoluments, and the blanks used in naturalization of aliens, may be considered as part of the record of the case. The instructions of the department of justice to the several clerks, dated January, 1879, may be read for any purpose for which they are properly applicable; but neither the defendant Hill nor his deputy, Mr. Bassett, has any recollection of receiving or seeing such a circular before October, 1884. The court may draw such inferences from the above facts as a jury might.'

Section of the Revised Statutes provides that every clerk of a district court shall, 'on the first days of January and July in each year, or within thirty days thereafter, make to the attorney general, in such form as he may prescribe, a written return for the half year ending on said days, respectively, of all the fees and emoluments of his office of every name and character, and of all the necessary expenses of his office, including necessary clerk hire, together with the vouchers for the payment of the same for such last half year. He shall state separately in such return the fees and emoluments payable under the bankrupt act. * * * Said returns shall be verified by the oath of the officer making them.' Section of the Revised Statutes provides that 'no clerk of a district court * * * shall be allowed by the attorney general * * * to retain the fees and emoluments of his office * * * for his personal compensation, over and above his necessary office expenses, including necessary clerk hire, to be audited and allowed by the proper accounting officers of the treasury, a sum exceeding three thousand five hundred dollars a year for any such district clerk, * * * or exceeding that rate for any time less than a year.' Section provides that every clerk shall, 'at the time of making his half-yearly return to the attorney general, pay into the treasury, or deposit to the credit of the treasurer, as he may he directed by the attorney general, any surplus of the fees and emoluments of his office, which said return shows to exist over and above the compensation and allowances authorized by law to be retained by him.' Section provides that, in every case where the return of a clerk 'shows that a surplus may exist, the attorney general shall cause such returns to be carefully examined, and the accounts of disbursements to be regularly audited by the proper officer of his department, and an account to be opened with such officer in proper books to be provided for that purpose.' The foregoing provisions of sections and were taken from section 3 of the act of February ) the supervision being changed from the secretary of the interior to the attorney general by section 15 of the act of June establishing the department of justice, () Section provides that the accounts of clerks 'shall be examined and certified by the district judge of the district for which they are appointed, before they are presented to the accounting officers of the treasury department for settlement. They shall then be subject to revision upon their merits by said accounting officers, as in the case of other public accounts.' This provision was taken from section 1 of the act of August )

________.
NOTE 1.—No money can be paid from the treasury to any clerk while his emolument return shall remain in arrear.
On the foregoing facts and statutes it was contended by the United States, before the circuit court, held by the circuit judge and the district judge, that the sums received as fees in naturalization proceedings were 'fees and emoluments' within the meaning of section and ought to have been included by the clerk in his returns, on the ground that they were received for services rendered by the clerk in his official capacity, and he was, therefore, bound to account, for them, whether they were or were not chargeable under section prescribing fees for clerks. The circuit court held that the action could not be maintained, and entered a judgment for the defendants, to review which the United States have brought a writ of error.
The opinion of the circuit court, which accompanies the record, and is reported in gives the following statement as to the former and the existing legislation of congress on the subject, and as to the action of the courts and of the executive departments of the government: 'By the act of March ) the compensation of the clerks was fixed at five dollars a day for attending court, and their travel. To this was added, by the act of May ) such fees as were allowed in the supreme courts of the state, with a provision that, for discharging duties not performed by the clerks of the state courts, and for which the laws of the state made no allowance, the court might allow a reasonable compensation. Under these acts the clerks were allowed to retain all their fees, and were not required to render any account of them to the government. The first law requiring returns to be made was the act of March ) This act established the compensation of clerks of courts at $a year, above clerk hire and office expenses, payable from fees only, and required them to pay the overplus into the public treasury, under such rules and regulations as might be prescribed by the secretary of the treasury. The next in order of time was the act of May ) That act required the clerks to make to the secretary of the treasury semi-annual returns, embracing all the fees and emoluments of their office, of every name and character, distinguishing those received or payable under the bankrupt act from those received or payable for any other service. It authorized the clerk of the district court to retain from the fees and emoluments of his office, above office expenses and clerk hire, as his personal compensation, $a year, and required him to pay the surplus into the treasury. It has been stated that the provision in this act as to bankruptcy fees was inserted to change the law, as ruld by Judge STORY, that the clerks were not bound to account for fees earned under the bankrupt act of August 19, 1841. The act of March ) establishing the department of the interior, transferred the supervision of the accounts of clerks of the the secretary of the interior. Until the act of February ) the official fees of the clerks remained in substance as fixed by the acts of The act of was the first uniform statute regulating the fees of the clerks and other officers of the courts throughout the United States. It established the present fee-bill, and is reproduced in sections of the Revised Statutes. Its provisions in regard to returns to be made by the clerks were the same as in the act of except that they were to be made to the secretary of the interior, as directed by the act of instead of to the secretary of the treasury. Since the act of June 22, creating the department of justice, the returns have been made to the attorney general, and supervision of these accounts has been exercised by that officer of the government.' Referring, then, to the fee-bill of February 26, 1853, as found in sections et seq. of the Revised Statutes, the court proceeds: 'Upon an examination of the statute, it will be seen that it applies to taxable costs in all ordinary litigation, whether at law or in equity or admiralty, and undoubtedly governs the taxation in all such actions, suits, and proceedings, civil and criminal, in personam and in rem, in the courts of the United States. But it has not usually been considered, at least in this district, as applying to certain special and peculiar cases, of which the courts have jurisdiction, where only the party asking for the right or privilege is before the court, and from the nature of the case no costs are taxable as in ordinary litigated suits. Of such a character are proceedings under the naturalization laws, under the shipping commissioner's act, and applications to be admitted to practice as an attorney. Thus Judge SHEPLEY early refused to allow the clerk to tax costs by the fee-bill on applications under the shipping commissioner's act of June Rev. St. § 4544,) for the money and effects of deceased seamen deposited in the circuit court by the shipping commissioner. In respect to naturalization cases, it has never been hitherto understood, either by the judges or the departments, that the fees of the clerk were for services rendered in his official capacity. At times, especially before elections, these applications are extremely numerous. The papers are usually prepared by the parties themselves, or their friends, or, more frequently, by agents of candidates. The hearings are ex parte, at no stated times, and it is rare that any person appears in opposition. It has, therefore, been necessary, both in the interest of the applicants and for the due and orderly execution of the law, and to enable the court to dispose of the cases, that the papers should be looked over and corrected by some person familiar with the law and practice, and in many instances that the witnesses should be examined before the cases were presented to the court for final action. It was for this service that the clerk has been allowed to make these charges to the parties. These are duties which the court has the undoubted right to have performed by some other person than the presiding judge. In these cases the clerk acts rather as a person appointed to assist the court in exercising its functions, like a master or examiner in an equity cause, or an assessor in admiralty, or an auditor in a suit at law. It is the universal practice of all courts of large jurisdiction to appoint special officers, at the expense of the parties, to make inquiries, in vestigate details, examine papers, take accounts, make computations, and perform ministerial acts. Their reports, when returned into court and accepted, become part oft he case, and form the basis of the orders and decrees of the court in the cause. It was with this view, to regulate the practice in naturalization cases, and define the duties required of the clerk, that Judge SPRAGUE, in 1855, adopted the following rules, which have ever since been in force: 'Ordered, by the court, that applications by aliens to be admitted to become citizens of the United States shall be presented to the court while in session, and that proof of the facts whereof the court is required by law to be satisfied shall be made by at least two credible and disinterested witnesses, who are citizens of the United States, to be produced and examined in open court. Ordered that, before such applications are presented, all necessary papers shall be filed with the clerk, who shall report to the court, when the application is made, that he has examined the same, and whether they are all in due form and in conformity with the requirements of law, or how otherwise."
This fact, as to these rules made in 1855, was not made a part of the agreed statement of facts, but the counsel in the cause in this court stipulated in open court that the fact should be taken as agreed. The opinion of the circuit court then proceeds: 'It is for services rendered under these rules, and as a special officer of the court, and not as clerk, that these fees have been permitted. They were not duties pertaining to the office of clerk. They could as well have been performed by any other person designated by the court for the purpose; as by the district attorney, or a commissioner of the circuit court, or an attorney, or any suitable person not an officer of the court. Reference has been made to the circular of Attorney General Devens, of January 14, 1879, issued to the clerks. In it he says, referring to section 'This language embraces every possible fee or emolument accruing to you by reason of your official capacity, and does not allow the withholding of any. Whatever is done by you that you could not do if out of office has an official color and significance that brings it within the compass of the language of the statute.' This is undoubtedly a forcible and accurate statement of the meaning of the statute. But the naturalization fees do not come within this rule. They did not accrue to the clerk by reason of his official capacity, and were for work which might as well have been done by him when out of office as when in. It is also to be noticed that this circular calls upon the clerks for 'a statement of sums received for searches, for all copies for naturalization papers and oaths, and all other sums received through your office,' but makes no mention in terms of naturalization fees. Reg. Dep. Just. No complaint of these fees has ever come to the ear of the court from any quarter. On the contrary, this service performed by the clerks has been of great advantage to those seeking to be admitted as citizens. It has had the effect, as originally intended, to simplify the process of becoming a citizen, and to make it more expeditious and inexpensive. It saves the parties the expense of employing an attorney, and the fee charged therefor is much less than would be allowed by the fee-bill, if the application is to be treated and entered on the docket of the court as an ordinary suit. In rejected cases no fee has been charged. This practice has prevailed for more than forty years, ever since the act of which first required returns, and has been perfectly well-known to everybody conversant with the courts. It was begun by Judge STORY and Judge SPRAGUE, and has had the approval of all the judges of this district since their day. It has also had the sanction successively of the department of the treasury, the department of the interior, and the department of justice. Until this suit was brought, it has never been called in question by any accounting officer of the government; nor has congress seen fit to put a stop to it by legislation. This constructin of the statute in practice, concurred in by all the departments of the government, and continued for so many years, must be regarded as absolutely conclusive in its effect. Edwards' Lessee v. Darby, U. S. v. Temple, Ruggles v. Illinois, Sup. Ct. Rep. U. S. v. Graham, Sup. Ct. Rep. It was stated at the bar that a bill was introduced in the last congress to require the clerks to make returns of all fees which they should receive for naturalizations and as masters and commissioners, but failed to become a law. If a change in the practice should be thought desirable, it is obvious that it should be made by congress, and not by the courts. It is also to be noticed as significant that the clerks of the courts of Massachusetts, under a fee-bill much like ours, and a statute requiring them to make to the county treasurer yearly a return 'of all fees received by them for their official acts and services,' were never required to include in their returns the fees received in naturalization cases. Rev. St. c. This was changed by the act of which defined what the fees in such cases should be, and directed the clerks to include them in their returns. The decision of the court is that, upon the agreed facts in this case, this action cannot be maintained.'
Viewing the whole subject in the light in which it appears on the face of the statute in regard to the fees of the clerk, we are met by the fact that section of the Revised Statutes, taken from section 1 of the act of February ) provides that 'the following, and no other, compensation shall be taxed and allowed' to clerks of the district courts. This applies prima facie to taxable fees and costs in ordinary suits between party and party prosecuted in a court. There is no specification of naturalization matters in the fees of clerks. From as early as December, 1839, the practice, set forth in the agreed statement of facts, has obtained in the district court in Massachusetts of charging the fees of one dollar and two dollars as gross sums in naturalization proceedings, without any division for specific services, according to any items of the fee-bill. The act of March 3, 1841, before referred to, the first one on the subject of returns, implied that there should be reports of 'fees and emoluments' by the clerk to the secretary of the treasury. The act of May 18, provided for semi-annual returns to that officer, and included, specifically, fees and emoluments under the bankrupt act. But the clerk never has included in these returns his fees and emoluments for naturalization proceedings, and his action from to and including has been with the knowledge of the successive district judges, to whom his accounts have been semi-annually exhibited. From to these accounts went to the secretary of the treasury; from to to the secretary of the interior; and since they have gone to the attorney general. From the statute has required that these accounts, before going forward, 'shall be examined and certified by the district judge,' and that, after being sent to the several heads of the departments, they shall be subject to revision on their merits by the accounting officers of the treasury department. The agreed statement of facts shows that this course has been pursued; that the district judge has examined and certified the accounts, knowing that they did not include naturalization fees; and that those accounts have been revised on their merits by these accounting officers, for this long series of years, and been examined and adjusted by them with the naturalization fees not included. With this long practice, amounting to a contemporaneous and continuous construction of the statute, in a case where it is doubtful whether the statute requires a return of the disputed fee, judges of eminence, heads of departments, and accounting officers of the treasury having concurred in an interprotation in which those concerned have confided, the surety in the present bond, as well as his principal, had a right to rely on that interpretation in giving the bond; and the semi-annual accounts of the principal having been actually examined and adjusted at the treasury, with the naturalization fees excluded, down to and including the one last rendered five months before this suit was brought, a court seeking to administer justice would long hesitate before permitting the United States to go back, and not only as against the clerk, but as against the surety on his bond, reopen what had been settled with such abundant and formal sanction. This principle has been applied, as a wholesome one, for the establishment and enforcement of justice, in many cases in this court, not only between man and but between the government and those who deal with it, and put faith in the action of its constituted authorities, judicial, executive, and administrative.
In Edwards' Lessee v. Dar by, it was said: 'In the construction of a doubtful and ambiguous law, the contemporaneous court action of those who were called upon to act under the law, and were appointed to carry its provisions into effect, is entitled to very great respect.' To the same effect are U. S. v. Dickson, U. S. v. Gilmore, Smythe v. Fiske, U. S. v. Moore, U. S. v. Pugh, Hohn v. U. S., Sup. Ct. Rep. and Five per cent. Cases, Sup. Ct. Rep. In the case of Brown v. U. S., Sup. Ct. Rep. the same doctrine was applied, the cases in this court on the subject being collected, and it being said that a 'contemporaneous and uniform interpretation 'by executive officers charged with the duty of acting under a statute 'is entitled to weight' in its construction, 'and in a case of doubt ought to turn the scale.' A still more recent case on the subject is U. S. v. Philbrick, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. where this language is used: 'A contemporaneous construction, by the officers upon whom was imposed the duty of executing those statutes, is entitled to great weight; and since it is not clear that that construction was erroneous, it ought not now to be overturned.'
Judgment affirmed.

120 U.S. 183
PHOENIX MUT. LIFE INS. CO.
v.
RADDIN, Sp. Adm'r, etc.
January 31, 1887.
1
This was an action brought by Sewell Raddin, and prosecuted by his administrator, upon a policy of life insurance dated April 25, 1872, the material parts of which were as follows: 'This policy of assurance witnesseth that the Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Company of Hartford, Conn., in consideration of the representations made to them in the application for this policy, and of the sum of one hundred and fifty-two dollars and ten cents to them duly paid by Sewell Raddin, father, and of the semi-annual payment f a like amount on or before the twenty-fifth day of April and October in every year during the continuance of this policy, do assure the life of Charles E. Raddin, of Lynn, in the county of Essex, state of Massachusetts, in the amount of ten thousand dollars, for the term of his natural life. This policy is issued and accepted by the assured upon the following express conditions and agreements,' namely, among others, that 'if any of the declarations or statements made in the application for this policy, upon the faith of which this policy is issued, shall be found in any respect untrue, this policy shall be null and void.' The application was signed by Sewell Raddin, both for his son and for himself, and contained 29 printed 'questions to be answered by the person whose life is proposed to be insured, and which form the basis of the contract,' three of which, with the written answers to them, and the concluding paragraph of the application, were as follows:
1
 Is the party addicted to the habitual use of spirituous liquors or opium?
2
3
No.
3
 Has any application been made to this or any other company for assurance on the life of the party? If so, with what result? What amounts are now assured on the life of the party, and in what companies? If already assured in this company, state the No. of policy.
4
 Equitable Life Assurance Society.
5
 Is the party and the applicant aware that any untrue or fraudulent answers to the above queries, or any suppression of facts in regard to the health, habits, or circumstances of the party to be assured, will vitiate the policy, and forfeit all payments thereon?
6
7
Yes.
7
8
'It is hereby declared that the above are fair and true answers to the foregoing questions, and it is acknowledged and agreed by the undersigned that this application shall form the basis of the contract for insurance, which contract shall be completed only by delivery of policy, and that any untrue, or fraudulent answers, any suppression of facts, or should the applicant become as to habits, so far different from condition now represented to be in as to make the risk more than ordinarily hazardous, or neglect to pay the premium on or before the day it becomes due, shall and will render the policy null and void, and forfeit all payments made thereon.'
8
9
It was admitted at the trial that all premiums were paid as they fell due; that Charles E. Raddin died July 18 1881; and that at the date of this policy he had an endowment policy in the Equitable Life Insurance Society for $ which was afterwards paid to him.
9
10
One of the defenses relied on at the trial was that the answer to question 28 in the application was untrue, and that there was a fraudulent suppression of facts material to the insurance, because the plaintiff, by his answer to that question, '$ Equitable Life Assurance Society,' intended to have the defendant understand that the only application which had been made to any other company for assurance upon the life of his son was one made to the Equitable Life Assurance Society, upon which that society had issued a policy of $ whereas in fact the plaintiff, within three weeks before the application for the policy in suit, had made applications to that society, and to the New York Life Insurance Company, for additional insurance upon the son's life, each of which had been declined. The defendant offered to prove that the two other applications were made and declined as alleged, and that the facts as to the making and the rejection of both those applications were known to the plaintiff, and intentionally concealed by him, at the time of his application to the defendant; and upon these offers of proof asked the court to rule that the answer to question 28 was untrue, and therefore no recovery could be had on this policy; second, that there was a suppression of facts by the plaintiff, and therefore he could not recover; and, third, 'that the answer to question 28 must be construed to be an answer to all the clauses of that question, and as such was misleading, and amounted to a concealment of facts which the defendant was entitled to know, and the plaintiff was bound to communicate.' But the court excluded all the evidence so offered, declined to give any of the rulings asked for, and ruled 'that, if the answer to one of the interrogatories of question 28 was true, there would be no breach of the warranty; that the failure to answer the other interrogatories of question 28 was no breach of the contract; and that, if the company took the defective application, it would be a waiver on their part of the answers to the other interrogatories of that question.' The jury having returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the full amount of the policy, the defendant's exceptions to the refusal to rule as requested, and to the rulings aforesaid, present the principal question in the case.
10
11
The rules of law which govern the decision of this question are well settled, and the only difficulty is in applying those rules to the facts before us. Answers to questions propounded by the insurers in an application for insurance, unless they are clearly shown by the form of the contract to have been intended by both parties to be warranties, to be strictly and literally complied with, are to be construed as representations, as to which substantial truth in everything material to the risk is all that is required of the applicant. Moulor v. American Ins. Co., Sup. Ct. Rep. Campbell v. New England Ins. Co., Thomson v. Weems. 
11
12
The misrepresentation or concealment by the assured of any material fact entitles the insurers to avoid the policy. But the parties may by their contract make material a fact that would otherwise be immaterial, or make immaterial a fact that would otherwise be material. Whether there is other insurance on the same subject, and whether such insurance has been applied for and refused, and material facts, at least when statements regarding them are required by the insurers as part of the basis of the contract. Carpenter v. Providence Washington Ins. Co., Jeffries v. Life Ins. Co., 22 Wall. 47; Anderson v. Fitzgerald, Macdonald v. Law Union Ins. Co., L. R. Edington v. AEtna Life Ins. Co., and .
12
13
Where an answer of the applicant to a direct question of the insurers purports to be a complete answer to the question, any substantial misstatement or omission in the answer avoids a policy issued on the faith of the application. Cazenove v. British Equitable Assurance Co., affirming S. C. But where upon the face of the application, a question appears to be not answered at all, or to be imperfectly answered, and the insurers issue a policy without further inquiry, they waive the want or imperfection in the answer, and render the omission to answer more fully immaterial. Connecticut Ins. Co. v. Luchs, Sup. Ct. Rep. Hall v. People's Ins. Co., Lorillard Ins. Co. v. McCulloch, American Ins. Co. v. Mahone, Carson v. Jersey City Ins. Co., N. J. Law, 210; Lebanon Ins. Co. v. Kepler. 
13
14
The distinction between an answer apparently complete, but in fact incomplete, and therefore untrue, and an answer manifestly incomplete, and as such accepted by the insurers, may be illustrated by two cases of fire insurance, which are governed by the same rules in this respect as cases of life insurance. If one applying for insurance upon a building against fire is asked whether the property is incumbered, and for what amount, and in his answer discloses one mortgage, when in fact there are two, the policy issued thereon is avoided. Towne v. Fitchburg Ins. Co., 7 Allen, 51. But if to the same question he merely answers that the property is incumbered without stating the amount of incumbrances, the issue of the policy without further inquiry is a waiver of the omission to state the amount. Nichols v. Fayette Ins. Co., 1 Allen, 63.
14
15
In the contract before us the answers in the application are nowhere called warranties, or made part of the contract. In the policy those answers and the concluding paragraph of the application are referred to only as 'the declarations or statements upon the faith of which this policy is issued;' and in the concluding paragraph of the application the answers are declared to be 'fair and true answers to the foregoing questions.' and to 'form the basis of the contract for insurance.' They must therefore be considered, not as warranties which are part of the contract, but as representations collateral to the contract, and on which it is based.
15
16
The twenty-eighth printed question in the application consists of four successive interrogatories, as follows: 'Has any application been made to this or any other company for assurance on the life of the party? If so, with what result? What amounts are now assured on the life of the party, and in what companies? If already assured in this company, state the No. of policy.' The only answer written opposite this question is '$ Equitable Life Assurance Society.' The question being printed in very small type, the answer is written in a single line midway of the opposite space, evidently in order to prevent the ends of the letters from extending above or below that space; and its position with regard to that space, and to the several interrogatories combined in the question, does not appear to us to have any hearing upon the construction and effect of the answer. But the four interrogatories grouped together in one question, and all relating to the subject of other insurance, would naturally be understood as all tending to one object,—the ascertaining of the amount of such insurance. The answer in its form is responsive, not to the first and second interrogatories, but to the third interrogatory only, and fully and truly answers that interrogatory by stating the existing amount of prior insurance, and in what company, and thus renders the fourth interrogatory irrelevant. If the insurers, after being thus truly and fully informed of the amount and the place of prior insurance, considered it material to know whether any unsuccessful applications had been made for additional insurance, they should either have repeated the first two interrogatories, or have put further questions. The legal effect of issuing a policy upon the answer at it stood was to waive their right of requiring further answers as to the particulars mentioned in the twenty-eighth question, to determine that it was immaterial, for the purposes of their contract, whether any unsuccessful applications had been made, and to estop them to set up the omission to disclose such applications as a ground for avoiding the policy. The insurers, having thus conclusively elected to treat that omission as immaterial, could not afterwards make it material by proving that it was intentional.
16
17
The case of London Assur. v. Mansel, on which the insurers relied at the argument, did not arise on a question including several interrogatories as to whether another application had been made, and with what result, and the amount of existing insurance, and in what company. But the application or proposal contained two separate questions,—the first whether a proposal had been made at any other office, and, if so, where; the second whether it was accepted at the ordinary premium, or at an increased premium, or declined; and contained no third question or interrogatory as to the amount of existing insurance, and in what company. The single answer to both questions was, 'Insured now in two offices for £ at ordinary rates. Policies eff cted last year.' There being no specific interrogatory as to the amount of existing insurance, that answer could apply only to the question whether a proposal had been made, or to the question whether it had been accepted, and at what rates, or declined; and as applied to either of those questions it was in fact, but not upon its face, incomplete, and therefore untrue. As applied to the first question, it disclosed only some, and not all, of the proposals which had in fact been made; and, as applied to the second question, it disclosed only the proposals which had been accepted, and not those which had been declined, though the question distinctly embraced both. That case is thus clearly distinguished in its facts from the case at bar. So much of the remarks of Sir GEORGE JESSEL, M. R., in delivering judgment, as implies that an insurance company is not bound to look with the greatest attention at the answers of an applicant to the great number of questions framed by the company or its agents, and that the intentional omission of the insured to answer a question put to him is a concealment which will avoid a policy issued without further inquiry, can hardly be reconciled with the uniform current of American decisions. For these reasons, our conclusion upon this branch of the case is that there was no error of which the company had a right to complain, either in the refusals to rule, or in the rulings made.
17
18
Another defense relied on at the trial was that after the issue of the policy Charles E. Raddin became, as to habits of using spirituous liquors, so far different from the condition he was represented to be in at the time of the application as to make the risk more than ordinarily hazardous, and thus to render the policy null and void. The bill of exceptions, after showing that in support of this defense the defendant introduced evidence, which it is now unnecessary to state, because the exception to its admission was abandoned at the argument, contains this statement: 'In rebuttal of the foregoing defense of change of habits on the part of the assured after the issuing of the policy, the plaintiff not only denied the fact, but offered evidence tending to show that the defendant was informed of such change in habits prior to its receipt of the last premium, and that it gave no notice to Sewell Raddin of its intention to cancel the policy. Evidence to the contrary was introduced by the defendant, and the questions of change of habits, knowledge thereof by the company, notice to Sewell Raddin, receipt of premium after knowledge, and waiver, were all submitted to the jury.'
18
19
The whole charge to the jury is made part of the bill of exceptions, in accordance with a practice which this court for more than half a century has emphatically condemned, and has by repeated decisions, as well as by express rule, constantly endeavored to suppress. As long ago as Mr. Justice STORY, speaking for the whole court, said: 'The charge is spread in extenso upon the record, a practice which is unneccessary and inconvenient, and may give rise to minute criticisms and observations upon points incidentally introduced, for purposes of argument or illustration, and by no means essential to the merits of the case.' Evans v. Eaton, Opinions to the same effect have been delivered in many later cases. Carver v. Jackson, Ex parte Crane, Conard v. Pacific Ins. Co., Magniac v. Thompson, Gregg v. Sayre, Stimpson v. West Chester R. Co., Zeller v. Eckert, U. S. v. Rindskopf, this court adopted a rule which, with slight verbal changes, has ever since remained in force, by which it was ordered, not only that the judges of the circuit and district courts should not allow any bill of exceptions containing the charge of the court at large to the jury in trials at common law, upon any ground of exception to the whole of such charge, but also 'that the party excepting be required to state distinctly the several matters of law in such charge to which he excepts; and that such matters of law, and those only, be inserted in the bill of exceptions, and allowed by the court.' Rule and 1 How. and and 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 5.
19
20
The disregard of this rule has caused the principal embarrassment in dealing with the question now under consideration.
20
21
The substance of the instructions to the jury on this part of the case was as follows: The judge directed the jury that if they should find that the assured was addicted to the habitual use of spirituous liquors at the date of the policy, or his habits afterwards changed in this respect so as to make the risk more than ordinarily hazardous, they would consider whether there had been a waiver on the part of the insurance company. The judge then told the jury that the plaintiff not only claimed that any misrepresentation as to the habits of the assured, or failure to inform the company of a change in those habits, had been waived by the company by accepting payment of a premium on or about April 25, 1881, after it had knowledge of the habits of the assured, or of the change in those habits, but further claimed that mere silence of the company, after knowledge of such change in habits, was a waiver of the violation of the provision of the policy; and the judge did charge the jury upon both the supposed grounds of waiver, instructing them that if the defendant had knowledge of the change in the habits of the assured before receiving the premium of April 25, 1881, the acceptance of that premium would be a waiver, which would estop the company to set up that the policy was forfeited for a breach of that provision; and further instructing them that if the company, having knowledge of the change in the habits of the assured, did not give notice to the plaintiff of that change, and he was prejudiced in any way by the failure of the company to give such a notice, and by reason of this silence of the company did any act, or omitted to do any act, which prejudiced him, there was a like waiver and estoppel on the part of the company.
21
22
The bill of excepted, after setting out the charge of the court, proceeds as follows: 'To so much of the foregoing instructions as related to notice and waiver the defendant excepted, and asked the court to instruct the jury (1) that no notice of the cancellation of the policy or termination of the risk was necessary, if the jury find the fact to be that the habits of the assured had so far changed from the condition represented to be in as to make the risk more than ordinarily hazardous; (2) that even if any notice were necessary at all, under any circumstances, until the company had completed its investigations, if the company acted in good faith and with reasonable dispatch, they were not bound to give the notice; also that the receipt of the last premium, April 25, 1881, pending such investigations, would not amount to a waiver, especially if a much larger sum was tendered back when full knowledge was had by the company. The court refused these requests, and the defendant excepted thereto.'
22
23
But the bill of exceptions does not state what the investigations and the tender were which are mentioned in the second request for instructions, or at what time or for what purpose either was made; nor does it show that any evidence had been introduced of prejudice to the plaintiff in consequence of the defendant's silence, or any other evidence upon the question of waiver, except that already mentioned, namely, that 'the plaintiff offered evidence tending to show that the defendant was informed of such change in habits prior to its receipt of the last premium, and that it gave no notice to Sewell Raddin of its intention to cancel the policy,' and that 'evidence to the contrary was introduced by the defendan .' It does not, therefore, appear that the instructions requested, or the instructions given, except so far as they related to the effect of accepting payment of the last premium with previous knowledge of the habits of the assured, had any application to the case on trial Except as just mentioned, the bill of exceptions is in the same condition as that of which Mr. Justice MILLER, delivering a former judgment of this court, said: 'There is in no part of this bill of exceptions any statement of the evidence. There is no statement that any evidence was offered, or that any was objected to. With the exception of the reference to it in the charge of the court, there is nothing to show what was proved, or what any of the evidence tended to prove. The prayers for instruction, therefore, may have been hypothetical, and wholly unwarranted by any testimony before the jury.' Worthington v. Mason. 
23
24
It follows that the only question upon the instructions of the court to the jury which is open to the defendant on this bill of exceptions is whether, if insurers accept payment of a premium after they know that there has been a breach of a condition of the policy, their acceptance of the premium is a waiver of the right to avoid the policy for that breach. Upon principle and authority, there can be no doubt that it is. To hold otherwise would be to maintain that the contract of insurance requires good faith of the assured only, and not of the insurers, and to permit insurers, knowing all the facts, to continue to receive new benefits from the contract while they decline to bear its burdens. Insurance Co. v. Wolff, Wing v. Harvey, Frost v. Saratoga Mut. Ins. Co., Bevin v. Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co., Insurance Co. v. Slockbower, Viele v. Germania Ins. Co., 26 Iowa, 9; Hodsdon v. Guardian Life Ins. Co.. 
24
25
The only objection remaining to be considered is that of variance between the declaration and the evidence, which is thus stated in the bill of exceptions: 'After the plaintiff had rested, the defendant asked the court to rule that there was a variance between the declaration and the proof, inasmuch as the declaration stated the consideration of the contract to be the payment of the sum of $ and of an annual premium of $ while the policy showed the consideration to be the representations made in the application as well as payment of the aforesaid sums of money, and that an amendment to the declaration was necessary; but this the court declined to rule, to which the defendant excepted.'
25
26
But the 'consideration,' in the legal sense of the word, of a contract, is the quid pro quo; that which the party to whom a promise is made does or agrees to do in exchange for the promise. In a contract of insurance, the promise of the insurer is to pay a certain amount of money upon certain conditions; and the consideration on the part of the assured is his payment of the whole premium at the inception of the contract, or his payment of part then, and his agreement to pay the rest at certain periods while it continues in force. In the present case, at least, the application is collateral to the contract, and contains no promise or agreement of the assured. The statements in the application are only representations upon which the promise of the insurer is based, and conditions limiting the obligation which he assumes. If they are false, there is a misrepresentation, or a breach of condition, which prevents the obligation of the insurer from ever attaching, or brings it to an end; but there is no breach of any contract or promise on the part of the assured, for he has made none. In short, the statements in this application limit the liability of the insurer, but they create no liability on the part of the assured. The expression at the beginning of the policy, that the insurance is made 'in consideration of the representations made in the application for this policy,' and of certain sums paid and to be paid for premiums, does not make those representations part of the consideration, in the technical sense, or render it necessary or proper to plead them as such. Judgment affirmed.

BOFINGER and others, Copartners, etc.,
v.
TUYES and others.1
January 31, 1887.
1
In a maritime cause of collision arising on the waters of the Mississippi river, the owners of the steam-boat Sabine filed their libel in the district court of the United States for the Eastern district of Louisiana against the steam-boat Richmond, to recover damages for the loss alleged to have been occasioned by the fault of the latter. The owners and claimants of the Richmond, being the plaintiffs in error in this cause, defended against the libel filed by the owners of the Sabine, and also filed a cross-libel, alleging damage to the Richmond in the collision caused by the fault of the Sabine, and claiming damages therefor. A decree was rendered in this cause June 5, 1873, against the steam-boat Sabine and her owners, Sarah C. Shirley, R. F. Fuller, and America B. Selby, and Nathaniel C. e lby, her husband, together with Alfred Moulton, Charles Cavaroc, Jules Tuyes, and Achille Chiapella, the four last named being sureties for the owners of the Sabine in a bond for the sum of $ conditioned to pay any damages adjudged in favor of the owners of the Richmond as cross-libelants in the suit, which the libelants had been required by the court to give. The amount of the decree against the owners of the Sabine, as principals, was $damages, besides costs, and against each of the four named surities the sum of $ that being the amount limited in the obligation as the several liability of each. From this decree all the parties appealed to the circuit court of the United States for the Eastern district of Louisiana. For the purpose of perfecting the appeal, Fuller, Moulton, Cavaroc, Tuyes, and Chiapella executed and filed an appeal-bond in the sum of $ the condition of which was that, if they should prosecute their appeal to effect, and answer all damages and costs, and satisfy whatever judgment might be rendered against them, if they failed to make their appeal good, the obligation should be void; and on this bond J. W. Hincks and Pierre S. Wiltz, two of the defendants in error, were sureties, each in the sum of $ The cause was heard on this appeal in the circuit court on the eleventh of March, 1876, when a decree was rendered in the cause, dismissing the original libel, maintaining the cross-libel, and condemning the original libelants, the owners of the steam-boat Sabine, together with their sureties in the original bond of $ viz., Moulton, Cavaroc, Tuyes, and Chiapella, to pay to the owners of the steam-boat Richmond, as damages, the sum of $ with costs. The decree of the circuit court as against Moulton, Cavaroc, Tuyes, and Chiapella, sureties as aforesaid, was several as against each in the sum of $ that being the amount for which they respectively bound themselves. From this decree of the circuit court the owners of the steam-boat Sabine, the original libelants, together with the Merchants' Mutual Insurance Company, the Mechanics' & Traders' Insurance Company, the Factors' & Traders' Insurance Company, the New Orleans Mutual Insurance Company, the Sun Mutual Insurance Company, the New Orleans Insurance Association, the Crescent Mutual Insurance Company, and the Commercial Insurance Company, all of which insurance companies were libelants and intervenors in certain other similar causes consolidated with that of the original libel of the owners of the Sabine against the Richmond, joined in an appeal to the supreme court of the United States from the several decrees rendered in the consolidated causes, including that in which the present defendants in error were parties. The bond given for the prosecution of that appeal to the supreme court was in the sum of $ and did not operate as a supersedeas. The defendants in error in this cause were not parties to this appeal. The appeal from the decree of the circuit court was heard at the October term, of the supreme court, when it was ordered and decreed that the decree of the circuit court appealed from should be and the same was affirmed. Subsequently an execution was issued on the decree of the circuit court, running against Moulton, Cavaroc, Tuyes, and Chiapella, for the sum of $ with interest at 5 per cent. per annum from March 11, 1876, and costs. Motions were made on May 3, 1881, on behalf of Moulton and Tuyes, defendants in that execution, to quash the same on the ground that the said decree, as against each of the said sureties, had been satisfied and discharged. These motions came on to be heard June 16, 1881, on consideration whereof they were allowed, and the writ of fieri facias quashed, and the marshal ordered to desist from any further proceedings thereunder. The plaintiffs in error thereafter, on the seventh of March, 1882, being the owners of the steam-boat Richmond, or their representatives, commenced this action against the defed ants in error, as parties to the appeal-bond given for the prosecution of the appeal from the original decree of the district court to the circuit court. The defendants rely upon two defenses: (1) That the matters in controversy were finally adjudged in their favor by the circuit court on the motion to quash the execution issued against them on its decree, so as to constitute an estoppel upon the principle of res judicata; (2) that the decrees of the circuit court against them, respectively, were discharged by payments made and accepted in full satisfaction thereof, by way of compromise, prior to the appeal taken by the other parties to the supreme court of the United States. The cause came on to be heard before the circuit court on May 29, 1883, when the parties, having duly waived the intervention of a jury, submitted the cause to the court; on consideration whereof the court rendered judgment in favor of the defendants. The object of the present writ of error is to reverse that judgment.

It appears from the bill of exceptions taken on the trial that the plaintiffs below, to maintain the issues on their part, put in as evidence in said cause the appeal-bond, decree, and final judgment, and the mandate of the supreme court of the United States, as the same are described and referred to in the plaintiffs' petition, and also the amount of costs taxed in the cause, amounting to the sum of $ and rested their case. Thereupon the defendants, to maintain the issues on their part, put in evidence, among other matters, the following: (1) The decree rendered by the district court against the owners of the Sabine in favor of the cross-libelants, the owners of the Richmond, showing the amount decreed against the sureties on the bond of $to be the sum of $ The decree of the circuit court in the same cause in the amount of $in solido against the owners of the steamer Sabine, and against the sureties on the original bond for $in the sum of $ The petition and allowance of the appeal from that decree to the supreme court of the United States, together with the appeal-bond for the prosecution thereof. (4) The record of the proceedings in the circuit court on the motion to quash the execution, together with the judgment of the court allowing said motion and quashing the said execution. (5) Four written papers, signed by Kennard, Howe & Prentiss, attorneys of record for the owners of the steamer Richmond in the proceedings in admiralty, showing payments made by the parties, respectively, in satisfaction of the decree of the circuit court against them, which papers are as follows:

It was then proved by John Kennard, a member of the firm of Kennard. Howe & Prentiss, that he signed the papers by the firm name of Kennard, Howe & Prentiss, who were the attorneys for the steamer Richmond; that he received the sums of money in the said papers severally mentioned; and that he executed the said papers under plenary authority from the plaintiffs to make the compromise. The plaintiffs then offered to prove by the same witness that the proctors for the owners of the steamer Sabine opened a negotiation with him to compromise said case, and offered to pay the sum of $for a compromise of the litigation then pending between the parties, and threatened an appeal from the decree and judgment of the circuit court, which had been rendered in favor of the owners of the steamer Richmond, unless said money should be accepted and said compromise effected; and that, for the purpose of ending said litigation, he accepted said money and compromised said case; that it was expressly agreed by the parties to that cause that said litigation was then ended, and that no appeal should be taken from the said decree and judgment of the circuit court. To this offer and evidence the defendant objected, on the ground that the papers in evidence constituted a contract in writing between the parties, and that no parol evidence impeaching them could be received. The court sustained the objection, and refused to hear the evidence, to which ruling the plaintiffs excepted.
22
23
It is not important to determine what effect, if any, should be given to the proceedings and order of the circuit court on the motion of the defendants Tuyes and Moulton to quash the execution issued on the decree against them. It does not appear from the record of these proceedings on what ground the judgment of the court was placed, and in its terms it is not final, as it merely quashes the particular writ of execution then in the marshal's hands, and directs him to take no further proceedings thereunder. If it had been based upon a finding of a payment of the decree, or of an accord and satisfaction equivalent to payment, and had directed satisfaction of the decree to be entered of record, as it clearly had power to do in such a proceeding, the judgment would have been conclusive as a defense to the bond in suit, notwithstanding the summary character of the proceeding. U. S. v. McLemore, Perkins v. Fourniquet, But the introduction of the record of these proceedings as evidence did not prejudice the plaintiffs in error; for the other evidence in the cause, and which no doubt is the same on which the circuit court acted in that proceeding, shows an accord and satisfaction equivalent to a payment of the decree, and in equity, to a satisfaction faction and discharge. It is so expressed in each of the papers executed at the time, which, although they are in one sense receipts acknowledging the payment of money, are also written evidence of an executed agreement by which the money was received in full payment and settlement of the decree and of the bond given for its payment now sued on. It is shown that the attorneys for the owners of the Richmond, who signed those receipts, were fully authorized to do so. The contract in each case is with the individual defendant for a satisfaction of the decree rendered against him severally. The payment and receipt of the money in pursuance of the agreement amounted to a release of errors, so that there was a valuable consideration to sustain the contract, whereby a less sum than the amount due by the decree was received in full payment.
23
24
The offer on the part of the plaintiffs in error to prove by parol another condition of the contract, viz., that the other defendants, the owners of the steam-boat Sabine, and the intervenors and other parties, the several insurance companies who had become parties to the appeal, should not take and perfect an appeal to the supreme court of the United States, was rightly rejected, because such parol evidence necessarily varied and contradicted the written agreement of the parties. The papers in evidence established a complete accord and satisfaction fully performed, in pursuance of an agreement to extinguish the liability of the defendants by reason of the original decree, and so to satisfy the obligation of the bond on which they are sued. The right of the defendants to appeal from the decree, and the fact that they had declared their intention to do so, created such a dispute in respect to their liability as made it a proper subject of compromise. A compromise was made and fully performed on their part. They paid the money, which was received in payment of the decree, and took no appeal. It is not now open to the plaintiffs in error to treat this payment merely as a credit on account and hold the defendants to their original liability. U. S. v. Child, Oglesby v. Attrill. 
24
25
The technical difficulty that there can be no satisfaction and discharge of a judgment or decree, except by matter of record, (Mitchell v. Hawley, Amer. Dec. ) cannot be interposed. At common law actual payment of a debt of record could not be pleaded in bar of an action for the recovery of the debt. This has been changed by statute both in England and in this country, and no reason can be assigned why an accord and satisfaction should not have the same effect. In the present case the action is not on the decree, but on the appeal-bond, and for the recovery of damages arising from the breach, as to which matters in pais, such as payment or accord and satisfaction, were always a good plea.

v.
BLOCK.
SAME
v.
ISAACS.
January 31, 1887.
1
These are suits on injunction bonds, given by the plaintiffs in error to the defendants in error, respectively, Friedlander being a surety. On the twentieth of January, 1874, Meyers & Levi, Lehman, Godchaux & Co., and Michael Frank filed a petition in the district court of the United States for the district of Louisiana to have their alleged debtors, Block Bros., a firm composed of Simon and Joseph Block, declared bankrupts, and the petition charged, among other things, that the alleged bankrupts had, on the ninth of January preceding, sold a certain store of goods, situated at Opelousas, to Solomon Isaacs, their brother-in-law, with intent to defraud their creditors. At, or immediately after, the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, the petitioning creditors filed a special petition for an injunction to prevent Isaacs from disposing of the store or its contents. A similar petition was filed against David Block, a brother of the members of the firm of Block Bros., alleging that the bankrupts had sold to him another store of goods at Opelousas with intent to defraud their creditors. Writs of arrest and provisional seizure were issued against the bankrupts, and injunctions against Solomon Isaacs and David Block, in accordance with the prayers of the several petitions. Applications were immediately made by the pat ies to set these proceedings aside; and such a showing was presented to the district court that, on the thirty-first of January, the following order was made, towit: 'The rules to set aside the arrest, provisional seizure, and injunction came up, * * * when, after hearing the pleadings, evidence, and arguments, it is ordered by the court that the writs of arrest and provisional seizure be set aside, but that the injunction be maintained, on the complaining creditors giving bond and security to save the parties harmless from the effects of said injunction in such sum as will be fixed by the court upon ascertaining the value of the property, and to that end the parties shall take their evidence before Register Kellogg.' Evidence having been taken under this order, the court, on the seventh of February, 1874, made the following order, to-wit: 'After hearing counsel on both sides, it is ordered by the court that the complaining creditors do give bond and security in the sum of $in favor of Solomon Isaacs, and another bond in the sum of $in favor of David Block, to save the parties harmless from the effects of the injunction issued in this cause.' Bonds were accordingly given in pursuance of these orders, and the injunctions were retained. Motions to dissolve them, however, were pressed, and after a large amount of evidence had been taken and laid before the court, they were dissolved on the merits on the eighteenth and twentieth of March, 1874. The bonds referred to were executed for the respective penalties required; but the conditions did not follow the precise terms of the orders. The bond given to Isaacs, with which that given to Block corresponded, was in the following words, to-wit:

'Know all men by these presents, that we, Meyers & Levi, Meyer Weill, Michael Frank, and Samuel Friedlander, are held and firmly bound, jointly and severally, unto Solomon Isaacs in the sum of five thousand dollars, lawful money of the United States of America, to be paid to the said Solomon,' etc.

'SAM'L FRIEDLANDER.' In January, 1875, suits were brought on these bonds by Solomon Isaacs and David Block, respectively, in the Sixth district court for the parish of Orleans, to recover the damages sustained by reason of the injunctions, and on the thirtieth day of March, 1876, judgment was rendered in favor of Isaacs for the sum of $ with interest from judicial demand, and costs; and on the twenty-second of November, 1877, judgment was rendered in favor of Block for $ (the whole penalty of the bond,) with interest and costs. These judgments were severally appealed to the supreme court of Louisiana, and, after much consideration, were affirmed. The cases are now here on writs of error to the latter court; and the same errors are assigned in both cases, namely: First. The supreme court of Louisiana erred in subjecting the plaintiffs in error to the law and jurisprudence of Louisiana, when they were parties to an injunction bond given in equity in and by order of the federal court. Second. The supreme court of Louisiana erred in holding that the bond was regular. Third. The supreme court of Louisiana erred in holding that an action could be maintained on the bond in suit before its condition was broken. Fourth. The supreme court of Louisiana erred in holding that the bond in suit, construed with the order requiring it, could cover and bind the obligors for damages which had been sustained before it was given.
9
10
For supporting the first three assignments of error reliance is mainly placed on the case of Bein v. Heath, There an injunction had been obtained in the circuit court of the United States for the Eastern district of Louisiana to suspend proceedings of seizure and sale under a mortgage; and, to obtain the injunction, the complainants were required, by order of the court, to give bond, with sureties, to answer all damages which the defendant might sustain in consequence of said injunction being granted, should the same be thereafter dissolved. The bond given was conditioned that the principal and sureties would pay to the defendant in the injunction (the plaintiff in the case of seizure and sale) all such damages as she might recover against them in case it should be decided that the said injunction was unlawfully obtained, being in nearly the same form as the bonds now in controversy. The case proceeded to hearing, and a decree was made, establishing the mortgage and dissolving the injunction, which decree was affirmed on appeal to this court. The mortgage debt was over $ besides interest and costs. The property mortgaged was sold for $ Suit was then brought in the same court on the injunction bond, the plaintiff claiming, not only damages for expense and delay, but 10 per cent. per annum on the amount of the debt. The cause was tried by the court without a jury. On the trial the court allowed the plaintiff, in proof of damages sustained, to give evidence of counsel fees and other expenses incurred by the plaintiff before the injunction was issued, and of the value of lawyers' services in this court not paid for, and of the amount of the rents and profits of the mortgaged premises pending the suit; to all of which exceptions were taken; and judgment was rendered for the penalty of the bond, the court being of opinion that the damages from the injunction were greater than that amount. This court, on writ of error brought, reversed the judgment, Chief Justiee TANEY delivering the opinion. The bond was regarded by this court as a departure from the order requiring it, and as being in effect equivalent to an injunction bond given to suspend seizure and sale under the Louisiana practice, which operates as a security for the debt, as well as the damages arising from the injunction, the same as a recognizance in error in the English practice. Such a bond requires a recovery against the parties before the condition is broken; that is, a judgment for the debt in suit. This the court considered as entirely different from the bond required by a court of equity as a condition of granting an injunction, and different from the bond required by the order of the court in that case. 'In proceeding upon such a bond,' said the chief justice, 'the court would have no authority to apply to it the legislative provisions of the state. The obligors would be answerable for any damage or cost which the adverse party sustained by reason of the injunction, from the time it was issued until it was dissolved, but to nothing more. They would certainly not be liable for any aggravated interest on the debt, nor for the debt itself, unless it was lost by the delay, nor for the fees paid to the counsel for conducting the suit.' The chief justice also referred to the fact that no recovery had been had against the parties,—nothing but a seizure and sale of the mortgaged premises and a dissolution of the injunction; and therefore, as the court construed the bond, the contingency on which the obligors agreed to pay had not happened, and the condition of the bond was not broken. Under the construction given to the bond in that case, the court could not well do otherwise than reverse the judgment of the circuit court.
10
11
But, according to our view, the bond sued on in the cases before us do not demand any such construction. It is plain that they could not be intended as security for any debt or demand in litigation, but as security only for the damages that might be sustained by the issuing of the injunctions. The condition is to pay 'all such damages as he [Isaacs, in the one case, and Block, in the other] may recover against us in case it should be decided that the said writ of injunction was wrongfully issued.' Recover, how? By the law of Louisiana damages may be recovered for suing out an injunction without just cause, independently of a bond. Florance v. Nixon, But this cannot be done in the United States courts. Without a bond, no damages can be recovered at all. Without a bond for the payment of damages or other obligation of like effect, a party against whom an injunction wrongfully issues can recover nothing but costs, unless he can make out a case of malicious prosecution. It is only by reason of the bond, and upon the bond, that he can recover anything. When, therefore, the condition of the bond in these cases declares that the obligors will pay such damages as the obligee may recover against them, it must mean that they will pay such damages as he may recover by a suit on the bond itself. Otherwise it is senseless and vain. Construed in this way, it is in strict conformity with the order which required it. It is in this way that the bonds in question were finally construed by the supreme court of Louisiana, and we think that its construction was right. In its opinion in the Block Case the court says: 'Under our construction we find no difference in the obligation of parties 'to save David Block harmless from the effects of an injunction issued against him,' and the obligation contracted in this bond, 'to pay to David Block, the defendant in said injunction, all such damages as he may recover against the obligors in case it should be decided that the said writ of injunction was wrongfully issued.' We therefore hold that the bond in this case did comply with the condition prescribed in the judge's order, and that it was a valid bond.' The court not only construed the bonds in this way, but decided the cases upon this view as to their meaning and effect, awarding to the plaintiffs, respectively, only such damages as arose from the effects of the respective injunctions. The actions were brought to recover such damages. The petition in each case set forth the facts, showing the injuries which the plaintiff sustained as the immediate result of the injunction, and based his claim to a recovery entirely on the damages arising from such injuries. The evidence was directed to the establishment of these facts, and conformed to the allegations of the petition. The court, in its opinion in the Case of Dacid Block, after showing that the bond must be construed as intended to cover these damages, says: 'After a careful examination and consideration of the evidence in the record, we are satisfied that plaintiff suffered damages to the full extent of the amount allowed him by the lower court. The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed.' In the Case of Isaacs, the court at first reversed the judgment of the inferior tribunal, conceding that the order of the district court required security for the entire damages, past as well as future, but considering the bond as not framed in conformity with it, and as not covering any damages but such as arose after it was given, as to which there was no distinct evidence. Supposing, however, that damages might be recovered against the plaintiffs in the injunction independently of the bond, the court reserved to Isaacs the right to bring a suit for that purpose. But on a rehearing of the case, and after the argument and decision in the Block Case, the court came to a different conclusion, and held that the bond was in substantial conformity with the order, and was to be construed as intended to save the parties harmless from thee ffects of the injunction, adopting in all things the views expressed in the opinion in the Block Case. It then adds: 'This leaves open for consideration the question of the quantum of damages allowed by the judgment appealed from. We have gone over the evidence on this point with care and deliberation, and reviewed all the authorities cited bearing on this point, the same in both cases, and are satisfied that the amount awarded by the judgment is fully justified and sustained by the proof and the law.' The court thereupon set aside its former judgment, and affirmed that of the inferior court.
11
12
The fourth assignment of error is that the court erred in holding that the bond, construed with the order requiring it, bound the obligors for damages sustained before it was given. The solution of the question raised by this assignment depends upon the fair construction of the order, and of the bond given in pursuance of it, and read, as it should be read, in the light of it. The order was 'that the injunction be maintained on the complaining creditors giving bond and security to save the parties harmless from the effects of said injunction.' The last words clearly mean all the effects of the injunction. The condition of the bonds was to pay 'all such damages as he [the obligee] may recover against us, in case it should be decided that the said writ of injunction was wrongfully issued.' It seems plain to us that all the damages arising from the wrongful issue of the injunctions were intended to be covered by the bond, as well as by the order; in other words, that the bond was intended and understood as a compliance with the requirements of the order. That is the natural and obvious meaning of its language when the two are read together; and the parties signing the bond must be presumed to have been cognizant of the order under which it was given. It is unnecessary to review the authorities on this subject. It is undoubtedly true that a surety cannot be held beyond the terms or legal effect of his engagement; and when that has respect to the conduct or fidelity of the principal, or to any other matter usually contemplated as arising in the future, it is to be interpreted prospectively, and not retrospectively. But if, from the nature of the case, the subject of guaranty is a past transaction in whole or in part, and the language of the engagement, taken in its natural sense or legal effect, is broad enough to cover it, such language may properly be construed to do so. As to the power of a court of equity to impose any terms in its discretion as a condition of granting or continuing an injunction, there can be no question. This subject is considered in the case of Russell v. Farley. 
12
13
We see no error in the judgments of the supreme court of Louisiana in these cases, and they are affirmed, with costs.

EVERHART
v.
HUNTSVILLE FEMALE COLLEGE and others.
CLAY, Adm'r, etc.,
v.
SAME.
January 31, 1887.
1
These are appeals from a decree dismissing the original bill and a cross-bill in a suit begun in the circuit court of the United States for the Northern district of Alabama, by george M. Everhart against the Huntsville Female Academy, George W. F. Price, Martha T. Rison, Myra J. Erwin, Robert M. Erwin, William H. Erwin, Joseph B. Erwin, and Marcus A. Erwin, and in which Hugh L. Clay, as administrator de bonis non of Abraham R. Erwin, deceased, was afterwards added as a defendant; but, on looking into the record, we find no sufficient evidence of the jurisdiction of the circuit court, which depends alone on the citizenship of the parties. It is stated in the original bill that Everhart is a resident of Wisconsin, and the same fact is also shown by the testimony; but this, as it has often been held, is not enough. An averment of residence is not the equivalent of an averment of citizenship for the purposes of jurisdiction in the courts of the United States. Accordig to the pleadings, the Huntsville Female Academy is an Alabama corporation, and the other defendants are residents of either Alabama or Tennessee. The decree dismissing both the original and cross-bills is reversed, because the record fails to show the jurisdiction of the circuit court; but, as the fault rests alone on Everhart, the complainant in the original bill, whose duty it was to put on record the facts necessary to show the jurisdiction, the reversal will be at his costs in this court. This whole subject has already been considered twice during the present term,—once in Continental Ins. Co. v. Rhoads, and again in Peper v. Fordyce, The reasons for our judgment sufficiently appear in the opinions delivered in those cases. If, on the return of the case to the circuit court, it is made to appear that the citizenship necessary for the jurisdiction existed at the time the suit was brought, it will be for that court to determine whether an amendment of the pleadings ought to be allowed, so as to cure the present defects.

v.
COUNTY OF OTOE.1
January 31, 1887.

This case was argued upon the question of limitation. But we have no occasion to consider that question; for it does not appear that the circuit court had jurisdiction of the action. Unless the contrary appears affirmatively from the record, the presumption, upon writ of error or appeal, is that the court below was without jurisdiction. Robertson v. Cease, Grace v. American Cent. Ins. Co., Sup. Ct. Rep. Bors v. Preston, Sup. Ct. Rep. That the point as to jurisdiction was not made here by either party is immaterial, because, as said in Mansfield, C. & L. M. Ry. Co. v. Swan, Sup. Ct. Rep. 'the rule, springing FROM THE NATURE AND LIMITS OF THE JUDICIal power of the united states, is inflexible and without exception, which requires this court, of its own motion, to deny its own jurisdiction, and, in the exercise of its appellate power, that of all other courts of the United States, in all cases where such jurisdiction does not affirmatively appear in the record on which, in the exercise of that power, it is called to act. On every writ of error or appeal, the first and fundamental question is that of jurisdiction,—first of this court, and then of the court from which the record comes.' See, also, Hancock v. Holbrook, Sup. Ct. Rep. The act of March 3, 1875, (section 1,) excludes from the cognizance of a circuit or district court of the United States 'any suit founded on contract in fv or of an assignee, unless a suit might have been prosecuted in such court to recover thereon if no assignment had been made, except in cases of promissory notes, negotiable by the law-merchant, and bills of exchange.' One of the warrants is payable to Z. King and the other to Z. King or order. The latter is not indorsed by him in blank or to the order of the plaintiff. Plainly, therefore, upon any view of the statute, the plaintiff, as the holder or owner of the warrants, could not maintain a suit in the court below, unless King could have sued in that court, had he not sold the warrants. But it does not appear that King could have maintained the suit. There is no averment as to his citizenship, nor does his citizenship otherwise appear from the record. We must therefore presume, on this writ of error, that the circuit court was without jurisdiction.

PACIFIC R. R.
v.
UNITED STATES.
January 31, 1887.
1
The Pacific Railroad Company, the claimant in this case, is a corporation created under the laws of Missouri, and is frequently designated as the Pacific Railroad of that state, to distinguish it from the Central Pacific Railroad Company incorporated under the laws of California, and the Union Pacific Railroad Company incorporated under an act of congress, each of which is sometimes referred to as the Pacific Railroad Company.
1
2
From the fourteenth of August, 1867, to the twenty-second of July, 1872, it rendered services by the transportation of passengers and freight, for which the United States are indebted to it in the sum of $ unless they are entitled to offset the cost of labor and materials alleged to have been furnished by them, at its request, for the construction of certain bridges on the line of its road. The extent and value of the services rendered are not disputed. It is only the offset or charge for the bridges which is in controversy, and that charge arose in this wise: During the civil war the state of Missouri was the theater of active military operations. It was on several occasions invaded by Confederate forces, and between them and the soldiers of the Union conflicts were frequent and sanguinary. The people of the state were divided in their allegiance, and the country was ravaged by guerrilla bands. The railroads of the state, as a matter of course, were damaged by the contending forces; as each deemed the destruction of that means of transportation necessary to defeat or embarrass the movements of the other. In October, 1864, Sterling Price, a noted Confederate officer, at the head of a large force, invaded the state, and advanced rapidly toward St. Louis, approaching to within a few days' march of the city. During this invasion, 13 bridges upon the main line and south-western branch of the company's road were destroyed. Gen. Rosecrans was in command of the Federal forces in the state, and some of the bridges were destroyed by his orders, as a military necessity, to prevent the advance of the enemy. The record does not state by whom the others were destroyed; but, their destruction having taken place during the invasion, it seems to have been taken for granted that it was caused by the Confederate forces, and this conclusion was evidently correct. All the bridges except four were rebuilt by the company. These four were rebuilt by the government, and it is their cost which the government seeks to offset against the demand of the company. Of the four, two (one over the Osage river and one over the Moreau river) were destroyed by order of the commander of the Federal forces. The other two, which were over the Maramec river, it is presumed, were destroyed by the Confederate forces.
2
3
Soon after the destruction of the bridges, and during the same month, Gen. Rosecrans summoned to an informal conference, in St. Louis, several gentlemen regarded as proper representatives of the railroad company, being its president, the superintendent, and the engineer of the road, and several of the directors. The court below makes the following findings as to what there occurred.
3
4
'By Gen. Rosecrans it was stated that the immediate rebuilding of the bridges was a military necessity; that he should expect and require the company to do all in their power to put the roads in working order at the earliest possible moment; and that he intended to have what work they did not do, done by the government, and withhold from the freight earnings of the road a sum sufficient to repay the government for such outlays as in law and fact it should be found entitled to have repaid. The gentlemen present assured Gen. Rosecrans that they would do all in their power to rebuild the bridges, and put the roads in working order at the earliest moment, but they at the same time represe ted that several of the bridges, as they believed, had been destroyed by the proper military authority of the United States, and that in such cases the government was properly responsible for the loss, and should replace the bridges. Those which the public enemy had destroyed they conceded that the company should replace.
4
5
'Gen. Rosecrans replied, in substance: 'Gentlemen, the question of the liability of the government for repairing damages to this road is one of both law and fact, and it is too early now to undertake the investigation of that question in this stirring time. I doubt myself whether all the damages which you say the government should be responsible for will be found liable to be laid to the charge of the government. Nevertheless, whatever is fair and right I should like to see done. You tell me now, and I have been informed by some of your representatives individually, that the company's means are insufficient to make these large repairs, and make them promptly. Therefore I want to say to you that, as a military necessity, we must have the work done, and shall be glad to have the company do everything it can, and I will undertake to have the remainder done, and we will reserve out of the freights money enough to make the government good for that to which it shall be found to be entitled for rebuilding any or all of the bridges, and we will return the freights to you, or settle with you on principles of law and equity.' The gentlemen interested in the company reiterated their view of the case, that the company should pay for bridges destroyed by the public enemy, and that the government should replace at its own cost the bridges destroyed by its own military authorities.'
5
6
The court also finds that these mutual representations and assurances were not intended or understood on either side to form a contract or agreement binding on the government or the company; that no formal action upon them was taken by the board of directors; and that there was no proof that they were ever communicated to the directors, except as may be inferred from subsequent facts and circumstances mentioned; but that the company, through its directors and officers, promptly exerted itself, to its utmost power, to restore the roads to running order, and to that end co-operated with the government.
6
7
At the same time Gen. Rosecrans informed the secretary of war that the rebuilding of the bridges was 'essential, and a great military necessity,' in the defense of the state, and requested that Col. Myers should be authorized 'to have them rebuilt at once, the United States to be reimbursed the cost out of freight on the road.' The secretary referred the matter to the quartermaster general, who recommended that Gen. McCallum, superintendent of military roads, be directed to take the necessary measures immediately for that purpose. The secretary approved the recommendation, and Gen. McCallum was thereupon ordered to cause the bridges to be rebuilt by the quickest and surest means possible. It does not appear that the company had any notice of these communications, or of the order.
7
8
The bridge over the Osage river was destroyed on the fifth of October, 1864, by order of the officer commanding the central district of Missouri, acting under instructions from Gen. Rosecrans to 'use every means in his power to prevent the advance of the enemy.' The court finds that the destruction was ordered for that purpose, and that the exigency appeared to the officer, and in fact was, of the gravest character, and an imperative military necessity. The government rebuilt the bridge at an expense of $ and this sum it seeks to charge against the company.
8
9
The bridge across the Moreau was also destroyed by command of the same officer, under the same military exigency. The company commenced its reconstruction, but, before it was completed, the work was washed away by a freshet in the river. The government afterwards rebuilt it at an expense of $ and this sum it also § eks to charge against the company.
9
10
The two bridges across the Maramec were destroyed during the invasion, as already stated, but not by the forces of the United States. They were, however, rebuilt by the government as a military necessity, at an expense of $ and this sum, also, it seeks to charge against the company. The court of claims allowed the costs of three of the bridges to be charged against the company, but rejected the charge for the fourth,—the one over the Osage river. The United States and the claimant both appealed from its judgment,—the claimant because the cost of the three bridges was allowed; the United States because the charge for one of the four was disallowed.

The cost of the four bridges rebuilt by the government amounted to $ The question presented is whether the company is chargeable with their cost, assuming that there was no promise on its part, express or implied, to pay for them. That there was no express promise is clear. The representations and assurance at the conference called by Gen. Rosecrans to urge the rebuilding of the bridges were not intended or understood to constitute any contract; and it is so found, as above stated, by the court below. They were rebuilt by the government as a military necessity, to enable the Federal forces to carry on military operations, and not on any request of or contract with the company. As to the two bridges destroyed by the Federal forces, some of the officers of the company at that conference insisted that they should be rebuilt by the government without charge to the company, and, though they appeared to consider that those destroyed by the enemy should be rebuilt by the company, there was no action of the board of directors on the subject. What was said by them was merely an expression of their individual opinions, which were not even communicated to the board. Nor can any such promise be implied from the letter of the president of the company to the quartermaster general in November, subsequent to the destruction of the bridges, informing him that the delay of the war department in rubuilding them had prompted the company to 'unusual resources;' that it was constructing the bridges over the Gasconade and the Moreau rivers; and that the only bridge on the main line to be replaced by the government was the one over the Osage river, the company having replaced all the smaller and was then replacing all the larger ones. The letter only imparts information as to the work done and to be done in rebuilding the bridges on the main line. It contains no promise, as the court below seems to have thought, that, if the government would rebuild the bridge over the Osage river, it should be reimbursed for any other it might rebuild on the main line of the company. Nor do we think that any promise can be implied from the fact that the company resumed the management and operation of the road after the bridges were rebuilt; but on that point we will speak hereafter. Assuming, for the present, that there was no such implication, we are clear that no obligation rests upon the company to pay for work done, not at its request or for its benefit, but solely to enable the government to carry on its military operations.

It has been held by this court in repeated instances that, though the late war was not between independent nations, yet, as it was between the people of different sections of the country, and, the insurgents were so thoroughly organized and formidable as to necessitate their recognition as belligerents, the usual incidents of a war between independent nations ensued. The rules of war, as recognized by the public law of civilized nations, became applicable to the contending forces. Their adoption was seen in the exchange of prisoners, the release of officers on parol, the recognition of flags of truce, and other arrangements designed to mitigate the rigors of warfare. The inhabitants of the Confederate States on the one hand, and of the states which adhered to the Union on the other, became enemies, and subject to be treated as such, without regard to their individual opinions or dispositions; while during its continuance commercial intercourse between them was forbidden, contracts between them were suspended, and the courts of each were closed to the citizens of the other. Brown v. Hiatts.

The war, whether considered with reference to the number of troops in the field, the extent of military operations, and the number and character of the engagements, attained proportions unequaled in the history of the present century. More than a million of men were in the armies on each side. The injury and destruction of private property caused by their operations, and by measures necessary for their safety and efficiency, were almost beyond calculation. For all injuries and destruction which followed necessarily from these causes no compensation could be claimed from the government. By the well-settled doctrines of public law it was not responsible for them. The destruction or injury of private property in battle, or in the bombardment of cities and towns, and in many other ways in the war, had to be borne by the sufferers alone, as one of its consequences. Whatever would embarrass or impede the advance of the enemy, as the breaking up of roads, or the burning of bridges, or would cripple and defeat him, as destroying his means of subsistence, were lawfully ordered by the commanding general. Indeed, it was him imperative duty to direct their destruction. The necessities of the war called for and justified this. The safety of the state in such cases overrides all considerations of private loss. Salus populi is then, in truth, suprema lex. These views are sustained in treatises of text writers, by the action of congress, and by the language of judicial tribunals. Respublica v. Sparhawk, Parham v. Justices, Taylor v. Nashville & C. R. Co., Mayor v. Lord. 
13
14
Vattel, in his Law of Nations, speaks of damages sustained by individuals in war as of two kinds,—those done by the state, and those done by the enemy. And after mentioning those done by the state deliberately and by way of precaution, as when a field, a house, or a garden, belonging to a private person, is taken for the purpose of erecting on the spot a town rampart, or other piece of fortification, or when his standing corn or his store-houses are destroyed to prevent their being of use to the enemy, and stating that such damages are to be made good to the individual, who should bear only his quota of the loss, he says: 'But there are other damages, caused by inevitable necessity; as, for instance, the destruction caused by the artillery in retaking a town from the enemy. These are merely accidents; they are misfortunes which chance deals out to the proprietors on whom they happen to fall. The sovereign, indeed, ought to show an equitable regard for the sufferers, if the situation of his affairs will admit of it; but no action losses which she has occasioned, not willfully, but through necessity and by mere accident, in the exertion of her rights. The same may be said of damages caused by the enemy. All the subjects are exposed to such damages; and woe to him on whom they fall! The members of a society may well encounter such risk of property, since they encounter a similar risk of life itself. Were the state strictly to indemnify all those whose property is injured in this manner, the public finances would soon be exhausted, and every individual in the state would be obliged to contribute his share in due proportion,—a thing utterly impracticable.' Book .

15
Three cases in congress, one before the house of representatives in 1797, and two before the senate, one in 1822 and one in 1872, illustrate this doctrine.
15
16
In the first of these a Mr. Frothingham, of Massac usetts, presented a petition to the house of representatives, asking compensation for a dwelling-house, the property of his mother, burned at Charlestown, in March, 1776, by order of Gen. Sullivan, then commanding the American troops at that place. The committee on claims, to whom it was referred, made a report that they found that the house, for which compensation was sought, was, with several other buildings in the vicinity at that time, in possession of the British troops; and that, for the purpose of dislodging them, the general sent a party of troops with orders to set fire to the buildings, which was done accordingly; and that they apprehended that the loss of houses and other sufferings by the general ravages of war had never been compensated by this or any other government; that, in the history of our Revolution, sundry decisions of congress against claims of this nature might be found; and that the claim presented rested upon the same basis with all others where sufferings arose from the ravages of war. As the government had not adopted a general rule to compensate individuals who had suffered in a similar manner, the committee were of opinion that the prayer of the petitioner could not be granted, and no further action was had upon the claim. Amer. State Papers, class claims, p. 199.
16
17
In the second of the cases referred to, a Mr. Villiers, of Louisiana, presented a petition to the house of representatives, stating that during the invasion of the British in 1814-15, after the enemy had landed near the city of New Orleans, in order to prevent him from bringing up his cannon and other ordnance to the city, Gen. Morgan, commanding the Louisiana militia, caused the levee to be cut through, at or near the plantation of the petitioner, whereby the greater part of his plantation was inundated, and remained so till after the departure of the invading army from the state; that in consequence the petitioner had suffered great losses in the destruction of his sugarcane, cane plants, and in the expenses of repairing the levee, appraised at $ for which he prayed compensation. The committee on claims, to whom the petition was referred, recommended that its prayer should not be granted, on the ground that the losses were sustained in the necessary operations of war, for which the United States were not liable; and their recommendation was adopted. Amer. State Papers, class claims, p. 835; Annals Seventeenth Cong. (1st Sess.) pt. 
17
18
The third of the cases referred to is that of J. Milton Best, which was much discussed in the senate. His claim was for the value of a dwelling-house and contents destroyed by order of the officer commanding the Union forces in defense of the city of Paducah, Kentucky, in March, 1864. The city being attacked by the Confederates in force, the Federal troops, numbering were withdrawn into Fort Anderson. The claimant's house, which was about yards from the fort, was taken possession of by the sharpshooters of the enemy, who did great execution picking off men at the guns within the defenses. They were driven from the house by shells from the fort and gun-boats, and late that night the Confederates retired from their assault without success. They appeared with reinforcements the next morning, and the Union officer, regarding his command in great peril, his ammunition being nearly exhausted, gave orders for the destruction of all houses within musket-range of the fort. The claimant's loyalty was unquestioned. The officers in command at the post from time to time during the war testified to his reliability, and the effective aid he rendered the Union cause.
18
19
The senate committee on claims reported the case as one presenting the 'simple question of who shall pay for the destruction of a loyal citizen's property, destroyed by the order of a commanding officer to save his imperiled at the claimant's home, a place never in possession of the enemy, and in a non-seceding state.' Upon this question they § y: 'It appears to your committee that the facts establish a just claim against the government for private property taken and destroyed to prevent a greater destruction of its own property, and the massacre of its troops.' They reported that 'the injuries to the claimant's house, by shelling out the rebels in the battle of the twenty-fifth of March, [the day preceding the destruction of the property,] may be regarded as a casualty by the general ravages of war, which might properly be deducted from the amount of loss proved by claimant,' and they made what they deemed a proper deduction on that account in the bill presented by them for the payment of the damages. The bill was intended to cover the value of his property at the time it was burned to prevent its use by the reinforced enemy on the following day. In the debate which followed, it was contended by advocates of the bill that while the damage by shelling from our own fort during the battle came within the ravages of war, the subsequent burning of the house to prevent its being used by the sharp-shooters of the enemy was a taking by the government of private property for public use, for which compensation should be made.
19
20
The bill passed in the senate January 5, 1871, but was not acted upon by the house during that congress. It again passed in the senate, April 8, 1872, and in the house, May 18, 1872. It was vetoed by the president, June 1, 1872. In his message to the senate the president, after speaking of the claim as one for compensation on account of the ravages of war, and observing that its payment would invite the presentation of demands for very large sums of money against the government for necessary and unavoidable destruction of property by the army, said: 'It is a general principle of both international and municipal law that all property is held subject, not only to be taken by the government for public uses, in which case, under the constitution of the United States, the owner is entitled to just compensation, but also subject to be temporarily occupied, or even actually destroyed, in times of great public danger, and when the public safety demands it; and in this latter case governments do not admit a legal obligation on their part to compensate the owner. The temporary occupation of, injuries to, and destruction of property, caused by actual and necessary military operations, is generally considered to fall within the last-mentioned principle. If a government makes compensation under such circumstances, it is a matter of bounty rather than of strict legal right.' Cong. Globe, Forty-second Cong. (2d Sess.) pt. 
20
21
The message was referred to the committee on claims, and on the seventh of February, 1873, it was reported back with a recommendation that the bill be passed, the objections of the president to the contrary notwithstanding. On the twenty-fourth of the same month the bill was reached on the calendar, and was passed over upon objection. No further action was ever taken upon it in the senate, and consequently it never reached the house. The claim has been repeatedly presented to congress since, but has never been considered by either house. The principle that, for injuries to or destruction of private property in necessary military operations during the civil war, the government is not responsible, is thus considered established. Compensation has been made in several such cases, it is true; but it has generally been, as stated by the president in his veto message, 'a matter of bounty rather than of strict legal right.'
21
22
In what we have said as to the exemption of government from liability for private property injured or destroyed during war, by the operations of armies in the field, or by measures necessary for their safety and efficiency, we do not mean to include claims where property of loyal citizens is taken for the service of our armies, such as vessels, steam-boats, and the like, for the transport of troops and munitions of war, or buildings to be used § store-house and places of deposit of war material, or to house soldiers or take care of the sick, or claims for supplies seized and appropriated. In such cases it has been the practice of the government to make compensation for the property taken. Its obligation to do so is supposed to rest upon the general principle of justice that compensation should be made where private property is taken for public use, although the seizure and appropriation of private property under such circumstances by the military authorities may not be within the terms of the constitutional clause. Mitchell v. Harmony, U. S. v. Russell. 
22
23
While the government cannot be charged for injuries to, or destruction of, private property caused by military operations of armies in the field, or measures taken for their safety and efficiency, the converse of the doctrine is equally true, that private parties cannot be charged for works constructed on their lands by the government to further the operations of its armies. Military necessity will justify the destruction of property, but will not compel private parties to erect on their own lands works needed by the government, or to pay for such works when erected by the government. The cost of building and repairing roads and bridges to facilitate the movements of troops, or the transportation of supplies and munitions of war, must therefore be borne by the government.
23
24
It is true that, in some instances, the works thus constructed may afterwards be used by the owner. A house built for a barrack, or for the storage of supplies, or for a temporary fortification, might be converted to some purposes afterwards by the owner of the land, but that circumstance would impose no liability upon him. Whenever a structure is permanently affixed to real property belonging to an individual, without his consent or request, he cannot be held responsible because of its subsequent use. It becomes his by being annexed to the soil, and he is not obliged to remove it to escape liability. He is not deemed to have accepted it so as to incur an obligation to pay for it merely because he has not chosen to tear it down, but has seen fit to use it. Zottman v. San Francisco, Where structures are placed on the property of another, or repairs are made to them, he is supposed to have the right to determine the manner, form, and time in which the structures shall be built, or the repairs be made, and the materials to be used; but upon none of these matters was the company consulted in the case before us. The government regarded the interests only of the army; the needs or wishes of the company were not considered. No liability, therefore, could be fastened upon it for work thus done.
24
25
We do not find any adjudged cases on this particular point, whether the government can claim compensation for structures erected on land of private parties, or annexed to their property, not by their request, but as a matter of military necessity, to enable its armies to prosecute their movements with greater efficiency; and we are unable to recall an instance where such a claim has been advanced.
25
26
It follows from these views that the government can make no charge against the railroad company for the four bridges constructed by it from military necessity. The court will leave the parties where the war and the military operations of the government left them. The judgment of the court of claims must therefore be reversed, and judgment be entered for the full amount claimed by the railroad company for its services; and it is so ordered.

120 U.S. 241
CITY OF QUINCY
v.
STEEL.
January 31, 1887.
1
In the cases of Hawes v. Oakland, and Huntington v. Palmer, Id. the question of the growth of the form of invoking federal jurisdiction, where it does not otherwise exist, by the attempt of a corporation, which cannot sue in the federal court, to bring its grievance into that court by a suit in the name of one of its stockholders who has the requisitecitizenship, was very much considered. In order to give effect to the principles there laid down, this court at that term adopted rule 94 of the rules of practice for courts of equity of the United States, which is as follows: 'Every bill brought by one or more stockholders in a corporation, against the corporation and other parties, founded on rights which may properly be asserted by the corporation, must be verified by oath, and must contain an allegation that the plaintiff was a shareholder at the time of the transaction of which he complains, or that his share had devolved on him since by operation of law, and that the suit is not a collusive one to confer on a court of the United States jurisdiction of a case of which it would not otherwise have cognizance. It must also set forth with particularity the efforts of the plaintiff to secure such action as he desires on the part of the managing directors or trustees, and, if necessary, of the shareholders, and the causes of his failure to obtain such action.'
1
2
The bill in the present case, although verified by oath, is far from complying with the letter or the spirit of this rule. It does not contain an allegation that the plaintiff was a shareholder at the time of the transaction of which he complains, although the allegation on that subject includes a part of the time in which the city of Quincy failed to pay for its gas; but inasmuch as the sworn allegation in the bill was made on the eighteenth day of August, 1885, and he there swears that he had been the owner of the stock on which he brings this suit over four years, it is easy to suppose that he acquired this stock after the eleventh day of May, 1881, on which day the city, by its official action, notified the gas company that it repudiated the contract, and would no longer be bound by it. And it is not an unreasonable supposition that the gas company, foreseeing litigation which it might be desirable for that company to have carried on in a federal court, immediately after receiving notice of that resolution, had this stock placed in the hands of Mr. Steel for the purpose of securing that object, and, though the suit was delayed for two or three years, it was probably because the city continued to pay some part of the demand for the gas furnished by the company. The bill does not contain the allegation, expressly prescribed by this rule, that 'the suit is not a collusive one to confer on a court of the United States jurisdiction of a case of which it would not otherwise have cognizance.' The allegation of the bill 'that this suit is brought in good faith, and for the collection of, and to compel the collection of, what your orao r believes to be a meritorious claim,' is by no means the equivalent of this provision of the rule, for it may very well be understood that the party who is seeking to enforce a debt which he believes to be due is acting in good faith for the purpose of compelling its collection, while he may be well aware that he is imposing upon the court to which he actually resorts a jurisdiction which does not belong to it. The rule also requires that he must set forth with particularity his efforts to secure action on the part of the managing directors or trustees of the corporation of which he is a member, and, if necessary, of the shareholders, and the causes of his failure to obtain such action. In the case before us he seems to have made but a single effort to induce the directors of the gas company to institute a suit against the city to recover the money, and this was by a communication in writing, addressed to the board August 1, 1885. No copy of that letter is produced; but it is said that the board of directors laid the communication on the table. No copy of the order of the board upon that subject is produced. No effort at conversation with any of the directors, or any earnest effort of any kind upon his part to induce the directors to bring the suit, is shown in the bill. No attempt to call the attention of the shareholders to this matter during the four years in which he said he was a shareholder, and during which time the city was failing to pay its debt to the gas company, nor any effort at any of the meetings of the shareholders or of the directors to induce them to enforce the rights of the company against the city, is shown. The most meager description possible of a bare demand in writing, made 16 days before the institution of this suit, is all we have of the efforts which he should have made to induce this corporation to assert its rights. This letter was addressed to the board of directors August 1, 1885, from what point is not stated, but it may reasonably be inferred that it was from Alabama, of which state he was a citizen. The bill itself is sworn to the thirteenth day of August thereafter. How long a time was left for the consideration of this question by the board of directors, and what earnest efforts Mr. Steel may have made to induce their favorable action, may be easily inferred from the speed with which the bill was sworn to in Alabama and filed after he addressed his letter to the board. The inference that the whole of this proceeding was a preconcerted and simulated arrangement, to foist upon the circuit court of the United States jurisdiction in a case which did not fairly belong to it, is very strong.
2
3
In the case of Hawes v. Oakland, in speaking of this perfunctory effort to induce the trustees of the corporation to act, it is said: 'He (the plaintiff) must make an earnest, not a simulated, effort with the managing body of the corporation to induce remedial action on their part, and this must be made apparent to the court. If time permits or has permitted, he must show, if he fails with the directors, that he has made an honest effort to obtain action by the stockholders, as a body, in the matter of which he complains. And he must show a case, if this is not done, where it could not be done, or it was not reasonable to require it.' Again it is said: 'He merely avers that he requested the president and directors to desist from furnishing water free of expense to the city, except in case of fire or other great necessity, and that they declined to do as he requested. No correspondence on the subject is given; no reason for declining; * * * no attempt to consult the other shareholders, to ascertain their opinions or obtain their action. But within five days after his application to the directors this bill is filed.'
3
4
In the case of Huntington v. Palmer, the court says: 'Although the company is the party injured by the taxation complained of, which must be paid out of its treasury, i paid at all, the suit is not brought in its name, but in that of one of its stockholders. Of course, as we have attempted to show in the case just mentioned, (Hawes v. Oakland, supra, ) this cannot be done without there has been an honest and earnest effort by the complainant to induce the corporation to take the necessary steps to obtain relief.' See Detroit v. Dean, Sup. Ct. Rep. 
4
5
We think, upon the face of the bill in this case, there is an entire absence of any compliance with the rule of practice laid down for equity courts in such cases, and of any evidence of an earnest and honest effort on the part of the complainant to induce the directors of the gas company to assert the rights of that corporation. On the contrary, the clear impression left upon reading the bill is that it is an attempt to have a plain common-law action tried in a court of equity, and the rights of parties decided in a court of the United States who have no right to litigate in such a court, and that there is no sufficient reason in the bare fact that Mr. Steel is a stockholder in the corporation, which justifies such a proceeding. If other evidence were wanting of the soundness of our inferences on this subject, it is to be found in the fact that while the decree in this case was rendered on the first day of March, 1886, a suit was commenced by the gas company against the city of Quincy, on the same causes of action, in the circuit court of Adams county, in the state of Illinois, on the thirty-first day of March of the same year. This fact was brought to the attention of the circuit court of the United States at the same term in which the decree now appealed from was rendered, by a petition to vacate and set aside the decree, which that court overruled. It seems very obvious that the gas company, having obtained, through the instrumentality of this collusive suit by Mr. Steel, a decree setting its rights against the city of Quincy, then brought in its own name a suit in the state court, which it had not dared to do until those rights were adjusted in a court of the United States.
5
6
We are of opinion that the demurrer to the plaintiff's bill ought to have been sustained, and the bill dismissed. The decree is therefore reversed, and the case remanded to the circuit court with instructions to that effect.

120 U.S. 256
INDIANAPOLIS ROLLING-MILL CO.
v.
ST. LOUIS, FT. S. & W. R. CO.1
January 31, 1887.
1
This is a writ of error to the circuit court of the United States for the district of Kansas. The plaintiff in error, which was also the plaintiff below, is a corporation existing under the laws of Indiana, and doing business in that state. The defendant in error is a corporation of the state of Kansas. The latter company, while building its railroad, contracted on the eighth day of October, 1881, with the former for the purchase of iron rails. The contract was for tons, to be delivered, during the period between October and June inclusive, on board of the railroad cars at Indianapolis. A jury was waived, and the case was tried before the court, which made a finding of facts, on which it declared the law to be for the defendant, and rendered judgment accordingly. During the trial the defendant company produced a release, apparently executed by the plaintiff company, from the obligation of the contract to receive and pay for the iron, except so far as it had been fulfilled, and upon the validity oft his release the decision depends.
1
2
It appears from the facts found by the court that the plaintiff was in the habit of receiving payment for iron delivered, by drafts on the defendant, payable in New York, and that Moran Bros. were the financial agents of the defendant, through whom such payments were made; that drafts to the amount of $were due on the fourth day of October, 1882, and the company, being hard pressed for money, asked an extension of payment, which was granted for four months; that when these drafts again fell due, they were protested for non-payment, and the defendant company was insolvent, which fact was well known to the plaintiff. It appears, also, that Mr. Thomas, who was the treasurer of the plaintiff company, visited New York, and called upon the firm of Moran Bros., at whose banking-house said drafts were payable, and evdeavored to induce them to pay the drafts, but that Moran Bros., who had no funds of the defendant's at the time, declined to do so, but finally said: 'We, Moran Brothers, will pay these drafts if you will sign a release for the balance of the contract.' To this Mr. Thomas replied that he was not authorized to execute such a release; but he communicated with Mr. Jones, who was the president and superintendent of the company, and obtained from him authority to accept the money and sign the release. This was accordingly done, the release being dated 'New York, eighth February, 1883,' and signed 'INDIANAPOLIS ROLLING—MILL Co., by J. THOMAS, Treasurer.' It is said by the plaintiff that Mr. Thomas had no authority to execute this release, or to make this contract, and therefore it is void. Bearing upon this proposition, it is found, as a matter of fact, by the court, that Mr. Jones was president, and Mr. Thomas treasurer, at the time of this transaction. The original contract for the sale of the iron is executed by Mr. Jones, as president, without the seal of the company, and there is no evidence of any resolution of the board of directors authorizing or approving that contract. The by-laws of the plaintiff corporation, as the court finds, declare that the superintendent, who is this case was Mr. Jones, 'shall have charge of the works, property, and operations of the company, and shall employ all operatives, and certify all wages due and other expenditures to the secretary, * * * and shall, with the approval of the president, buy and sell material, and make all contracts for the same, and for work,' etc. And the court further finds that, under this bylaw, Mr. Jones had the power to buy and sell material, and to make all contracts for the same. Another by-law declares that 'the superintendent and all other persons shall in all cases be subject to the control of the board of directors, in everything where the board shall elect to exercise such control;' and the court finds that, in the making of the original contract sued on, and in the extension of the time for the payment of drafts, as hereinafter mentioned, the board of directors of plaintiff did not at any time or in any way elect to exercise the control over its officers given said board by said by-laws. The court further finds 'that, after the return of Mr. Thomas from the city of New York to Indianapolis, some time in March, there was a meeting of the board of directors of plaintiff, at which the validity of the release executed by Mr. Thomas was discussed, but the records do not show that at that particular meeting any definite action was taken; that the directors at that meeting did in fact agree to submit the question to counsel of plaintiff, let him investigate it, and then act upon his advice; that about two years after this meeting, and a year and a half after this suit was commenced, a nunc pro tunc entry was made upon the records of plaintiff of the proceedings of plaintiff's board of directors, which showed a repudiation upon the part of the board of directors of the release so executed; and that this suit was originally instituted in this court at the first term hereof after the execution of the release.'
2
3
We concur with the court below that on the facts thus stated the release was a valid release. Its execution was of that class of business which, under the by-laws of the corporation and the course of business between these parties, had been confided to the president and superintendent, both of which offices were held by Mr. Jones. The direction given by Mr. Jones to the treasurer, Mr. Thomas, both of whom were also directors in the corporation, was within the line of his authority. He had under this same authority, without any express resolution or ratification of the board of directors, made the contract on which this suit is brought; and it would seem that, not being under seal, a simple contract concerning the ordinary business of the company, the same power which enabled him to make it was sufficient to enable him to release it, unless the power had been withdrawn. Another principle leads to the same result. These by-laws show that the board of directors retained the power in their hands to control the president and superintendent in any transaction, whenever it was thought proper to do so. This matter was reported to the directors. They had a meeting upon the subject some six weeks after the whole thing had been consummated, and after they had received the benefit of the release by the payment of their drafts. The rule of law upon the subject of the disaffirmance or ratification of the acts of an agent required that, if they had the right to disaffirm it. They should do it promptly, and if, after a reasonable time, they did not so disaffirm it, a ratification would be presumed. In regard to this it appears that the board, when notified of what had been done by their agents, did not disaffirm their action at that time, but that the act or resolution of disaffirmance was passed about two years after notice of the transaction, and that, if the suit brought in this case can be considered as an act of disaffirmance, it came too late, as it was commenced some six months after they had knowledge of the release. As was stated in the somewhat analogous $wcase of Twin Luck Oil Co. v. Marbury, 'the authorities to the point of the necessity of the exercise of the right of rescinding or avoiding a contract or transaction as soon as it may be reasonably done, after the party with whom that right is optional is aware of the facts which gave him that option, are numerous. * * * The more important are as follows: Badger v. Badger, 2 Wall. 87; Harwood v. Railroad Co., 17 Wall. 78; Marsh v. Whitmore, Vigers v. Pike, Clark & F. 650; Wentworth v. Lloyd, Follansbe v. Kilbreth, ' See, also, Gold-mining Co. v. National Bank, Law v. Cross.

It is said that the release was without consideration, because Moran Bros. had the means in their hands to pay the drafts of the property of the defendants, but we think the finding of facts clearly disproves that; indeed, the court found, as a matter of fact, that the defendants were then insolvent, and that Moran Bros. had no funds in their hands out of which they could have paid the drafts. It is obvious, therefore, that the consideration for this release was the voluntary payment by Moran Bros. of the existing protested drafts of the plaintiff company out of their own means, and not out of the means of the defendant corporation. We think this was a sufficient consideration to support the release.

BEARD, Collector of Customs, etc.,
v.
NICHOLS and another, Copartners, etc.1
January 31, 1887.
1
The single question in this case is as to the duty payable in the latter part of and the early part of on 'webbing made of India rubber, wool, and cotton,' and known as 'wool elastic webbing,' as distinguished from 'union elastic webbing,' made of rubber, silk, and cotton, and 'cotton elastic webbing,' made of rubber and cotton. It is used for gores and gussets in the manufacture of congress boots, and, without the rubber, would not be adapted to that use. In its manufacture it is not wrought by hand or braided by machinery, but is woven in a loom. In the court below, three clauses of section of the Revised Statutes were brought under consideration, to-wit: First. Schedule L, 'Wool and Woolen Goods,' (Rev. St. ) 'Webbings, beltings, bindings, braids, galloons, fringes, gimps. cords, cords and tassels, dress trimmings, head nets, buttons, or barrel buttons, or buttons of other forms for tassels or ornaments, wrought by hand or braided by machinery, made of wool, worsted, or mohair, or of which wool, worsted, or mohair is a component material, 50 cents per pound, and, in addition thereto, 50 per cent. ad valorem.' Second. Schedule M, 'Sundries,' (Rev. St. ) 'India rubber, articles composed of.—Braces, suspenders, webbing, or other fabrics, composed wholly or in part of India rubber, not otherwise provided for, 35 per cent. ad valorem.' Third. Schedule L, 'Wool and Woolen Goods,' (Rev. St. ) 'Woolen cloths, woolen shawls, and all manufactures of wool of every description, made wholly or in part of wool, not herein otherwise provided for, 50 cents per pound, and, in addition thereto, 35 per cent. ad valorem.' In this court, however, it was conceded by the solicitor general, in his argument for the collector, that, as the third clause does not specifically provide for webbing, and both the others do, that clause would not be relied on here. The precise question to be determined is therefore whether these goods are dutiable as 'webbing, * * * composed wholly or in part of Indian rubber,' at 35 per cent. ad valorem, or as 'webbing * * * made of wool * * * or of which wool * * * is a component material,' at 50 cents per pound, and, in addition thereto, 50 per cent. ad valorem. The collector exacted the larger duty, and this suit was brought to recover back the difference between that and the smaller one. The court below gave judgment against the collector, and to reverse that judgment this writ of error was sued out.

In the tariff act of August St. 555,) was this provision: 'On India-rubber oil-cloth, webbing, shoes, braces, or suspenders, or other fabrics of manufactured articles composed wholly or in part of India rubber, 30 per centum ad valorem.' In the act of July 30, 1846, c. 74, § 11, Schedule C, (9 St. 44,) this was the language: 'Braces, suspenders, webbing, or other fabrics, composed wholly or in part of India rubber, not otherwise provided for.' The same provision was made in the act of March ) and in the act of July )w hich increased the duties on these articles 5 per centum ad valorem. In the last of these acts, (section ) was the following provision: 'On manufactures of India rubber and silk, or of India rubber and silk and other materials, 50 per centum ad valorem.' These provisions of the acts of were re-enacted in substantially the same language as part of the Revised Statutes. That in relation to manufactures of India rubber and silk, and India rubber and silk and other materials, is found in section immediately preceding the second of the clauses above referred to. In while the acts of were in force, and before the enactment of the Revised Statutes, Davies & Co. imported into New York 'suspenders or braces, manufactured of rubber, cotton, and silk,' and the collector exacted a duty of 50 per centum ad valorem as upon a manufacture of India rubber and silk and other materials; but this court held in Arthur v. Davies, that they were only dutiable at the rate of 35 per centum ad valorem, as suspenders or braces composed wholly or in part of India rubber, and that they were not 'otherwise provided for,' as manufactures of India rubber and silk and other materials, because for 30 years before the importation in that case, 'and in four different statutes, braces and suspenders, composed wholly or in part of India rubber, had been a subject of duty eo nomine.' During the same year Faxon, Elms & Co. imported into Boston from Liverpool webbing which was a manufacture of India rubber, silk, and cotton, known as 'Union Gussett,' 'Union Web,' or 'Union Elastic Web,' and used in the manufacture of the gores or gussets of congress boots. In this case, also, the collector exacted a duty of 50 per centum ad valorem, under section 8 of the act of as on manufactures of India rubber and silk and other materials, but this court held, at its October term, in Faxon v. Russell, (not reported,) on the authority of Arthur v. Davies, that the goods were only dutiable as webbing composed wholly or in part of India rubber. These cases, with which we are entirely satisfied, are conclusive upon the questions here involved. Ever since 'webbing,' composed wholly or in part of India rubber, has been a subject of duty eo nomine, and it is no more otherwise provided for, as webbing composed wholly or in part of wool than it would be as a manufacture of India rubber and silk, or of India rubber and silk and other materials, if silk had been one of its component parts.

SCHLESINGER and another, Copartners, etc.,
v.
BEARD, Collector of Customs.1
SAME
v.
UNITED STATES.
January 31, 1887.
1
These cases involve substantially the same questions, and may be considered together. One is a suit by Naylor & Co., importers, against Beard, the collector of customs in Boston, to recover back duties alleged to have been illegally exacted, and the other is a suit by the United States against the same importers to recover additional duties assessed on the liquidation of an entry after the delivery of the goods upon payment of estimated duties. The facts are these: In October, 1879, Naylor & Co. imported into the port of Boston, from England, tons of wrought scrap iron, consisting 'of the punchings and clippings of wrought-iron boiler-plates and wrought sheet-iron, left after the process of the manufacture of the boiler-plates into boilers was completed, and of the ends of bridge rods and beams of wrought iron, cut off to bring the rods and beams to the required length, and to remove imperfections.' When the entry was made at the custom-house, the duties were estimated upon the whole, at the rate of eight dollars per ton. On the payment of this estimate the iron was delivered to the importers. Afterwards pounds were classified by the customs officers as 'new wrought scrap iron,' and an additional duty of $charged thereon. For the recovery of this amount the suit in favor of the United States was brought. In November, 1879, the same parties imported from England tons of wrought scrap iron, consisting entirely of punchings and clippings, such as are described above. Upon this entry pounds were classified as 'old wrought scrap iron,' and charged with duty at the rate of eight dollars per ton, and pounds as 'new wrought scrap iron,' and charged at the rate of one cent a pound. The importers paid the duties assessed under protest as to the last item, and then sued to recover back $ the difference between the duties at eight dollars per ton and the amount actually paid. It was agreed that the punchings, clippings, and ends were all waste iron, and incapable of being further used, and that they were only fit for remanufacture. The only actual use to which they had been subjected was in the making of boilers from the plates out of which they had been cut in the process of manufacture, and in the building of bridges of which the rods and beams that had been cut to adapt them to their places formed a part. The importers claimed that all were dutiable as 'wrought scrap iron,' under Schedule E of section of the Revised Statutes, p. while the collector claimed that the part classified as 'new wrought scrap iron' was subject to a duty of one cent a pound, as 'iron less finished than iron in bars, and more advanced than pig-iron,' because it had not been in 'actual use.' The court below gave judgmen in each of the suits against the importers, to reverse which these writs of error were brought.
1
2
The provisions of the tariff act on which the cases depend are the following clauses in Schedule E of section of the Revised Statutes: '(] But all iron in slabs, blooms, loops, or other forms, less finished than iron in bars, and more advanced than pig-iron, except castings, shall be rated as iron in bars, and pay a duty accordingly,' i. e., one cent per pound. '(] Cast scrap iron of every description, six dollars per ton. Wrought scrap iron of every description, eight dollars per ton. But nothing shall be deemed scrap iron except waste or refuse iron that has been in actual use, and is fit only to be remanufactured.' This particular form of provision as to scrap iron, both cast and wrought, appeared for the first time in the act of July ) from which it was carried into the Revised Statutes. The earlier statutes were as follows: (1) An act of July ) 'That all scrap and old iron shall pay a duty of twelve dollars and fifty cents per ton; that nothing shall be deemed old iron that has not been in actual use, and fit only to be remanufactured; and all pieces of iron, except old, of more than six inches in length, or of sufficient length to be made into spikes and bolts, shall be rated as bar, bolt, rod, or hoop iron, as the case may be, and pay duty accordingly.' (2) An act of August ) which is substantially the same as the act of excepting only that the duty is reduced to $10 per ton. (3) An act of July 30, 1846, c. 74, § 11, Schedule 6, (9 St. 45,) which places among articles subject to a duty of 30 per cent. ad valorem, 'iron in bars, blooms, bolts, loops, pigs, rods, slabs, or other form not otherwise provided for; castings of iron; old or scrap iron.' (4) An act of March ) 'On old scrap iron, six dollars per ton: provided, that nothing shall be deemed old iron that has not been in actual use, and fit only to be remanufactured.' (5) An act of June ) which is in the exact language of the act of except that the duty is raised from six to eight dollars per ton. It thus appears that in 1870 the form of the statutes on this subject was materially changed, and that now the duty is laid upon 'scrap iron,' without any reference to whether it is new or old, and that all waste or refuse iron is scrap iron, if it has been in actual use, and is only fit for remanufacture.
2
3
That the iron now under consideration was waste iron is conceded; and, in our opinion, it had been 'in actual use' within the meaning of that term as employed in the statute. At one time it formed part of boiler-plates used in the manufacture of boilers, or of rods or beams used in building bridges. In order to fit the plates, rods, or beams to the places they were to occupy in the structures of which they were to form a part these pieces were cut off as useless, and thrown away, or, in the language of the trade, 'into the scrap heap.' They had become, by the use to which they were put, 'scrap iron,' in the popular sense of that term, and nothing else. It is true the cuttings and clippings had never themselves been used in the boilers or in the bridges, but they had been used in making those structures, and thus had accomplished the purpose for which they were originally manufactured. The plates, rods, and beams of which they were once parts had been used, and these were the waste resulting from that use. They are not old in the sense of having been worn by use, but they are scrap, and no longer capable of any use until remanufactured, because in their use they have been rendered worthless for any purpose except to remanufacture. In the popular sense, as manufactured articles, they have been used up,—made worthless by use; and this use has been actual, o t colorable only. The plates, rods, and beams were made to be used in a particular way. They have been so used, and these cuttings and clippings are the waste of that use. Consequently they are, in our opinion, 'wrought scrap iron,' and dutiable as such.

The judgment in each of the cases is reversed, and the causes remanded, with instructions to enter judgment upon the agreed facts in favor of the importers in the suit against the collector, and against the United States in the suit against the importers.

BANK OF MAYSVILLE
v.
CLAYPOOL and another.
January 31, 1887.
1
This is a writ of error for the review of an order of a distrc t court, having circuit court jurisdiction, remanding a cause which had been removed from a state court, under section 2 of the act of March ) on the ground of citizenship. The record shows a suit begun by the Bank of Maysville in the circuit court of Kenawha county, West Virginia, September 24, 1877, against Claypool, as maker, and Thayer, as indorser, of a promissory note. After a demurrer, which was overruled, a plea was filed November 26, on which the parties went to trial the same day before a jury. After the evidence on the part of the plaintiff was all in, the defendant Thayer prayed judgment, because, on the facts proven, no case had been made out against him. The jury, under instructions from the court, found the amount due on the note, 'subject to the judgment of the court on the demurrer to the evidence,' and were discharged. Afterwards, on the tenth of January, 1878, the bank moved for leave to amend its declaration so as to show that it was a corporation created by the laws of the state of Kentucky, 'and existing in said state of Kentucky.' This motion was denied, and the bank then moved for leave 'to withdraw its joinder to the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's evidence,' and that the verdict be set aside, and a new trial granted. While these motions were pending, undisposed of, the bank filed its petition for the removal of the suit to the district court of the United States sitting at Charleston, on the ground that the plaintiff was a Kentucky corporation, and the defendants were citizens of West Virginia. Objection was made by the defendants, on the fourth of November, 1879, to the entry of the case in the district court, but this objection was overruled, and the cause docketed by order of the court November 17, 1880. Thereupon the demurrer to the evidence was argued and submitted to the court. On the sixth of December, 1880, there was filed in this court a petition by the defendant Thayer, sworn to September 13, 1880, for a rule on the district judge to show cause why a mandamus should not issue requiring him to remand the suit. In this petition it did not appear that the court had taken any action in the matter, and it was denied because no application had been made for an order to remand. In the opinion it was said: 'We cannot doubt that, if such an application is made, it will be promptly granted, if the facts are as they are stated here. The petition for removal was not filed in the state court until after both trial and verdict, when the law requires it should be filed before or at the term at which the cause could be first tried, and before the trial thereof.' Afterwards, May 7, 1883, a motion to remand was made by Thayer, and at once granted by the court. To review that order this writ of error was brought.
1
2
In the Removal Cases, which were decided December 15, 1879, it was held that a petition for removal under the act of to be in time must be 'presented to the court before the trial is in good faith entered upon,' and we there said, (page ) 'There may be exceptions to this rule; but we think it clear that congress did not intend, by the expression 'before trial,' to allow a party to experiment on his case in the state court, and, if he met with unexpected difficulties, stop the proceedings, and take his suit to another tribunal. But to bar the right of removal it must appear that the trial had actually begun and was in progress in the orderly course of proceeding when the application was made. No mere attempt of one party to put himself on record as having begun the trial is enough. The case must be actually on trial by the court, all the parties acting in good faith, before the right of removal is gone.' This rule was recognized and followed in Jifkins v. Sweetzer, and Alley v. Nott, Sup. Ct. Rep. and must now be considered as settled. Clearly, therefore, this application for removal came too late. We n it was filed, the trial had not only begun, but it had progressed far enough to get a verdict of a jury, subject only to the decision of the court on the questions presented by the demurrer to the evidence. In this connection it is proper to say that the ruling in the Removal Cases was not probably known to the district judge when his order to docket the cause was made, because the volume of our reports in which those cases are found was not published and generally distributed until a very considerable time after our adjournment for the term in May, 1880. The court did not actually proceed in the case after it was docketed further than to take it on the submission of the demurrer to the evidence made at that time, and the order to remand was granted as soon as a motion to that effect was made by the bank.

The order remanding the case is affirmed.

WINCHESTER, Trustee, and others
v.
HEISKELL and others.
January 31, 1887.
1
This petition is denied; but inasmuch as the petitioners think that the points on which they relied for a reversal of the judgment were not clearly understood, we will restate what was decided.
1
2
1. We held that, as the suit of Townsend v. Jones was pending when Townsend filed his petition in bankruptcy, and when he made his assignment to Winchester, the assignee, Winchester, as such assignee, had the right to appear in that suit and have the amount due Heiskell, Scott, and Heiskell determined. It may be that, according to the practice in Tennessee, if he had not appeared, Heiskell, Scott, and Heiskell would have been compelled to bring a new suit to have the amount of their lien ascertained; but as he did appear, and did ask to have the matter adjudicated in that suit, he was bound by what was done. As the court had declared the lien, it was within its jurisdiction to ascertain, with the consent of all the parties, the amount that was due under the lien, and make the necessary order for its enforcement as against those who were parties to that suit. About this we have no doubt.
2
3
2. We said: 'The question here is, not whether that decree thus rendered binds these appellants, (plaintiffs in error,) but whether the state court had u risdiction so as to bind those who were parties to the suit, and those whom the parties in law represented.' The assignee having voluntarily made himself a party to the suit, and the court having at his request settled the amount of the lien, he was bound by what was done, and so were all whom he in law represented in the litigation. That certainly includes the general creditors of the bankrupt, but whether it does those claiming under the trust deed from Townsend, before his bankruptcy, to George W. Winchester, trustee, we did not then, and do not now, decide.

MERIWETHER
v.
JUDGE OF MUHLENBURG Co. COURT, in the State of Kentucky.1
January 31, 1887.
1
The only question necessary to be considered is whether the justices of the peace of Muhlenburg county constitute a necessary part of the county court when levying a tax to pay plaintiff's judgment. The constitution of Kentucky, adopted in 1850, provided for the organization of a county court in each county, to consist of a presiding judge and two associate judges, any two of the three to constitute a quorum, with power in the general assembly to abolish the office of associate judges whee ver it was deemed expedient, 'in which event they may associate with said court any or all of the justices of the peace' elected in the several districts into which the county is divided. Const. art. 4. It is also declared in the same instrument that 'the general assembly may provide by law that the justices of the peace in each county shall sit at the court of claims, and assist in laying the county levy and making appropriations.' Id. § 37. The words 'court of claims' are here employed to designate the county court when it sits for the purpose, among others, of ascertaining the claims against, and the expenses incurred by, the county, and of providing for their payment by appropriations out of the county levy; such levy being the annual tax imposed for county purposes, not upon property, but upon persons residing in the county, without reference to the value of their property. Rev. St. Ky. 296, c. 26. The county court is also described as 'the county court of levy and disbursements' when reference is made to its duty 'to erect and keep a sufficient county jail.' Id. The Revised Statutes provide that the county courts shall have jurisdiction to lay and superintend the collection and disbursement of the county levy; to erect, superintend, and repair all needful county buildings and structures; and 'to superintend and control the fiscal affairs and property of the county, and to make provision for the maintenance of the poor.' Id. They also provide that 'the office of associate judge of the county court is abolished,' and that 'a county court shall be held in each county at the seat of justice thereof by a presiding judge of the court, on the days prescribed by law,' except that 'at the court of claims * * * the justices of the peace of the county shall sit with the presiding judge and constitute the court;' and 'justices of the peace shall only compose a part of the court when it is engaged in laying the county levy, and in appropriating money, and in transacting other financial business of the county.' Id. The same provisions substantially are to be found in the General Statutes of the state which went into effect in Gen. St. Ky. 
1
2
It is clear that the levying and collection of a tax to meet a county subscription to the stock of a railroad company is not a business connected with the laying of the county levy, or with appropriations of money out of such levy. But it is insisted that it is a matter relating to the 'fiscal affairs' of the county, and is 'financial business of the county,' the control or management of which belongs, under the law, to the county court, composed of the presiding judge and the justices of the peace. On the other hand, the plaintiff in error contends this case is taken out of the operation of the general statute, by the fact that the special statute under which the county made the subscription and issued the bonds in question imposes upon the county court, held by the presiding judge, the absolute duty of levying the necessary tax. Upon this point there seems to be a settled course of decision in the highest court of Kentucky; and upon such a subject, as the organization or composition of a tribunal established by the fundamental law of the state, those decisions are, at least, entitled to great weight. Burgess v. Seligman, Sup. Ct. Rep. 10; Claiborne Co. v. Brooks, Sup. Ct. Rep. Norton v. Shelby Co., Sup. Ct. Rep. 
2
3
The first case in the court of appeals of Kentucky upon this question is Bowling Green & M. R. Co. v. Warren Co., (decided in 1875.) That was a proceeding to compel the county court to execute and deliver bonds in payment of a subscription to the stock of the railroad company,—a subscription sustained by a majority of the legal voters at an election held undert he order of the county court, composed of the presiding judge alone. The defense was that the county court, held by that officer, the justices being absent, was without authority to call the election there in question. The court, speaking by PRYOR, J., after observing that, as a general rule, when reference is made to a county court, or the action of a county court, it is understood as a court presided over by the county judge alone, said: 'A county court, held by the county judge, or by the judge in conjunction with the justices, has no power to impose such taxation as this on the people of the county, or to submit the question of taxation to the popular vote, without some special legislative enactment; and, in the absence of any such original jurisdiction belonging to either mode of organization, it remains to be determined whether the legislative intent, to be gathered from the provisions of appellant's charter, and particularly the sixteenth section, was to empower the county judge alone to exercise this right, or to require that the justices of the county should be associated with him. If the direction of the legislature had been imperative on the county court to enter the order submitting the question of subscription to the people, there would be little difficulty in determining this question; for, if the county court had been deprived of all discretion, and compelled to obey a mandatory act, it would be immaterial whether the county court, composed of the justices or the county judge, made the order, as either or both must obey. In this case the legislature seems to have departed from the usual course of legislation with reference to such charters, and instead of exercising its own judgment as to the interests of the people in this particular locality, or of permitting them primarily to do so, required that the county court, preliminary to a vote on the question by the people, should first, in its discretion, determine the propriety of such legislative action. This action on the part of the county court was certainly not judicial. The appellant had no right or claim on the people to make the subscription, or upon the county court to order the vote. The company was empowered by this act to make a request only of the county court that it might in its discretion accede to or refuse. * * * It was a matter of vital importance to the people of the county of Warren, as well as the other counties to whom such a proposition might have been made by appellant, that they should fully understand the nature of the burden they were about assuming; and the legislature in its wisdom saw proper to give them the benefit of the judgment of those who represented the various localities and interests in each county, in order that they might determine whether the benefits to be derived from the construction of this Railway would be an equivalent for the large expenditure to be made.' so the mandamus was refused, upon the ground that the special statute intended that the question of submitting a subscription to the vote of the electors should be determined, in the first instance, by the county court, composed of the judge and justices.
3
4
The same point again arose in the court of appeals of Kentucky in Logan Co. v. Caldwell, () and in Cook v. Lyon Co., () Neither of these cases is reported in the printed volume of decisions, but a copy of the opinion in each has been submitted to us. The case of Logan Co. v. Caldwell involved the validity of a subscription to the capital stock of the Owensville & Russellville Railroad Company, and of the bonds issued in payment thereof; the subscription having been voted at a popular election called by the county court held by the judge alone. The court, speaking by Chief Justice COFER, reaffirmed the rule announced in Bowling Green & M. R. Co. v. Warren Co., observing that it proceeded upon the idea that, as the justices of the peace are by law part of the county court in laying the levy,i n making appropriations of money, and generally when the financial interests of the county are involved, it ought to be presumed, when a discretion is given by law to the county court, in respect to a matter relating to the financial affairs of the county, that the legislature intended by the phrase 'county court' that tribunal to which it had committed the management of the general financial interests of the county. Adhering to this rule, the court sustained the subscription and bonds of Logan county, upon the ground that an act, amendatory of the charter of the company, and which was in force when the election was held, imperatively required the county court to make the subscription and issue the bonds, in accordance with the vote of the majority; and hence, as held in the former case, it was 'immaterial whether a court composed of the justices or held by the presiding judge alone made the order, as either must obey.'
4
5
In Cook v. Lyon Co. the question was as to the validity of certain bonds and coupons issued in conformity with a popular vote at an election called by the county court, held by the presiding judge alone, upon the question of a subscription to the stock of the Elizabethtown & Paducah Railroad Company, under the very act now before us. The court said: 'It is urged that the bonds and coupons are not valid, because the county judge, in ordering the election to take the vote as to whether the county should subscribe stock to said road, and in making the subscription and issuing the bonds therefor, acted alone, and without associating the justices of the county with him. The act in question provides that all this shall be done by the 'county court,' and contains no language from which it can be even inferred that the legislature intended that it should be done by the county levy or fiscal court of the county; and, although there is some reason in the claim that when the term 'county court' is used as to fiscal matters it refers to the fiscal court, yet, as a general rule, when reference is made to a county court, or the action of a county court, it means a court presided over by the county judge alone, and should be held to so mean when used in connection with fiscal matters if it relates to mere ministerial duties. Moreover, in this instance, the direction of the legislature to the county court to do these ministerial acts was imperative, and it is therefore immaterial whether it was done by the county judge alone, or by him and the justices, even admitting (as we do not) that a bona fide holder of the bonds can be affected by such matters.'
5
6
Taking these decisions as the basis upon which to rest our judgment in this case, it only remains to inquire whether the provisions of the act of February 24, 1868, are mandatory in their character, or only invested the county court with a discretion in respect to the material matters involved in the subscription by Muhlenburg county. When the railroad company requests the county court of any county, through or adjacent to which it is proposed to construct the road, to subscribe, either absolutely or conditionally, a specified amount to its stock, the act provides that 'the county court shall forthwith order an election to be held,' etc. The sections authorizing subscriptions by precincts, cities, or towns are equally imperative. Sections 5, 6: When a county subscribes under the provisions of the act, 'it shall be the duty of the county court * * * to issue the bonds of such county,' etc., to be signed by the 'county judge and countersigned by the clerk.' Section 7: In case of a subscription by an election district in any county, 'it shall be the duty of the county court of such county to issue the bonds of such district or districts in payment thereof,' etc. Section 8: We have already referred to the ninth section, which provides that, upon a subscription by any county, 'it shall be the duty of the county court of such county * * * to cause to be levied and collected a tax, suffice nt to pay the semi-annual interest on the bonds issued and the cost of collecting such tax and paying the interest, on all real estate and personal property in said county,' etc. On levying a tax as provided in the act, to pay the interest on bonds issued by a county, 'it shall be the duty of the county court * * * to appoint three resident tax-payers, * * * who shall be styled the board of commissioners of the sinking fund of such county.' Section 10: If dividends upon the stock subscribed prove to be insufficient to enable the county to pay its bonds at maturity, new bonds may be issued; but, if the county deems that course inexpedient, 'it shall be the duty of the county court * * * to cause a tax to be levied and collected on all property in such county * * * subject to taxation,' etc. And so of all the remaining sections of the company's charter. It would be difficult, we think, to frame an act more mandatory in its character than that of February 24, 1868. None of its provisions leave room for the exercise of discretion by the county court in respect to any matter upon which it is required to act. The learned court below announced that, except for the fourth section of this act it would decide (following the decisions in Bowling Green & M. R. Co. v. Warren Co. and Logan Co. v. Caldwell) that the 'county court' in the company's charter meant a court held by the presiding judge alone. That section provides '(4) that the person acting as sheriff at the several precincts shall return to the clerk of the county court, within [three] days after the day of such election, the poll-books of their respective precincts; and on the next day thereafter the county judge and county clerk shall count the vote, and if it shall appear that the majority of those voting voted in favor of the subscription of stock as proposed, the county judge shall order the vote to be entered on the record, and the subscriptions to be made by the clerk on behalf of the county on the terms specified in the order submitting the question to a vote.' We are unable to concur in the suggestion that the use of the words 'county judge,' in the fourth section of the act, in connection with the direction that the vote be entered on the record,—that is, upon the records of the county court,—is inconsistent with the idea that 'county court,' as used in the company's charter, meant merely the county court held by the judge thereof. As the counting must have been by individuals, not by a court, the requirement that the county clerk and county judge should perform that duty, and that the latter should cause the result to be entered on the records of the court, does not, we think, show an intention to invest the county court with any discretion whatever in ordering the election, or in issuing the bonds, or in levying taxes to pay the bonds, and interest thereon. In the absence of that discretion, it is the duty of the county court, held by the presiding judge alone, to levy the required tax. Such was the decision in Cook v. Lyon Co., to which the attention of the court below does not appear to have been called.

The counsel for the defendant in error refer to section 2, art. 17, c. 28, of the General Statutes, in force since December 1, 1873, which provides that 'if, under the provisions of any law hereafter enacted, it is required of the county court to submit to the qualified voters of the county, or to the qualified voters of any local community therein, the proposition to take stock in any, or to levy any tax other than for common school purposes; or if, under any law hereafter enacted, it is required that the county court shall decide upon the issue of any bonds of the county, or of any district or local community therein, to any railroad or other company, it shall be the duty of the county judge to cause all the justices of the peace of such county to be summoned to attend at the term of the court at which any such action is proposed to be taken, who shallb e associated with the county judge and constitute the county court for the occasion.' It is sufficient to say that, as that provision by its terms only applies to laws 'hereafter enacted,'—that is, enacted after the General Statutes went into operation,—it cannot affect the present case, which depends upon the construction to be given to an act passed in 1868.

As the court below erred in sustaining the demurrer to the original petition, the judgment is reversed, with directions to overrule that demurrer, and for such other proceedings as may be consistent with this opinion. Reversed.

UNITED STATES
v.
DUNN, Adm'x, etc.
February 7, 1887.
1
The plaintiff brought her suit as administratrix of the estate of George Dunn, her husband, who died on the twenty-ninth of September, 1884, to recover the difference between what was paid her and what she claimed should have been paid on account of his service as gunner in the navy from the eleventh day of April, 1878, until the tenth day of December, 1883. The court of claims gave her a judgment for $ This judgment was rendered upon the following finding of facts:
1
2
'(1) George Dunn, the claimant's intestate, was appointed a gunner in the navy, April 11, 1871, and served as such until January 1, 1883. He was subsequently retired, and has since died. (2) Prior to his appointment in the navy, he had served in the marine corps. He entered this corps first, June 10, 1843, in the eleventh year of his age, as a boy bound for ten years and twenty-two days to learn music, and June 22, 1844, was rated as a fifer; discharged September 8, 1848. Re-enlisted September 9, 1848, for four years; discharged June 8, 1849, by order of the secretary of the navy, as a minor. Re-enlisted August 10, 1849, for four years, as a fifer; discharged June 9, 1853. On the same day, to-wit, June 9, 1853, he re-enlisted for four years, as a fifer; discharged April 1, 1854, under a surgeon's certificate. Re-enlisted August 31, 1854, for four years, as a fifer; discharged February 24, 1857, under a surgeon's certificate. Re-enlisted May 19, 1857, for four years, as a fifer; discharged September 1, 1862, under a surgeon's certificate. The times of actual service from his first enlistment, June 10, 1843, to his last discharge, September 1, 1862, amounts to sixteen years five months and twenty-six days.
2
3
(3) Between the dates of his first enlistment and September 3, 1853, he served on board United States vessels of war, under the command of navy officers, for five years and two months. Where and under what command the remainder of his service was rendered does not appear.

'CONCLUSION OF LAW.
4
5
'Upon the foregoing findings of facts the court decides, as conclusion of law, that the sixteen years five months and twenty-six days of service, shown in finding 2 to have been rendered by claimant's intestate as an enlisted man in the marine corps, should be credited to him in calculating longevity pay under the act of March ) By so crediting this service the claimant is entitled to recover the sum of $'
5
6
The controversy arises upon the construction to be given to the following clause in the act making appropriation for the naval service, passed March 3, 1883, (22 U. S. St. at Large, ) Section 1 of that statute makes provision for the payment of the officers of the navy, of which George Dunn, the plaintiff's intestate, was one at that time. After reciting the officers, clerks, and other persons, including naval cadets, whose compensation is embraced in the aggregate sum of $ the section uses this language: 'And all officers of the navy shall be credited with the actual time they may have served as officers or enlisted men in the regular or volunteer army or navy, or both, and shall receive all the benefits of such actual service in all respects in the same manner as if all said service had been continuous, and in the regular navy in the lowest grade having graduated pay held by such officer since last entering the service.'
6
7
The plaintiff asserted that in adjusting her cla m for her husband's service with the accounting officers of the department she was entitled to the benefit of this provision on account of the service found to have been rendered by him in the second subdivision of the facts as found by the court. These accounting officers refused to make this allowance because, as they said, the services thus rendered were in the marine corps, and not in the army or navy.
7
8
It must be conceded that the marine corps, a military body in the regular service of the United States, occupies something of an anomalous position, and is often spoken of in statutes which enumerate 'the army, the navy, and the marine corps,' or 'the army and the marine corps,' or 'the navy and the marine corps,' in a manner calculated and intended to point out that it is not identical with either the army or the navy. And this argument is the one very much pressed to show that service in the marine corps is not service in the army or in the navy. On the other hand, the services rendered by that corps are always of a military character, and are rendered as part as the duties to be performed by either the army or the navy. If there are services prescribed for that corps by the statutes of the United States, or the regulations of either the army or the navy, which are not performed in immediate connection with the army or the navy, and under the control of the heads of the army or navy, either civil or military, we have not been made aware of it. The military establishment of this country is divided by the general laws of the United States into the army and the navy, and over each of these one of the great heads of departments, called 'secretaries,' is appointed to preside, to manage and to administer its affairs. The administrative functions of the executive are mostly under the president, distributed and allotted among the seven great departments, at the head of each of which is a minister for that department. Such is the theory of the distribution of executive administration established by the statutes of the United States.
8
9
The marine corps is a military bedy, designed to prform military services; and, while they were not necessarily performed on board ships, their active service in time of war is chiefly in the navy, and accompanying or aiding naval expeditions. In time of peace they are located in navy-yards mainly, although occasionally they may be used in forts and arsenals belonging more immediately to the army. The statutes of the United States, in prescribing the duties which they may be required to perform, have not been very clear in any expression which goes to show how far these services are to be rendered under the control of the officers of the navy or of the army. It is clear that they may be ordered to service in either branch; but we are of opinion that, taking all these statutes and the practice of the government together, they are a military body, primarily belonging to the navy, and under the control of the head of the naval department, with liability to be ordered to service in connection with the army, and in that case under the command of army officers.
9
of the Revised Statutes of the United States enacts that no person under 20 or over 25 years of age shall be appointed from civil life as a commissioned officer of the marine corps until his qualifications for such service have been examined and approved under the directions of the secretary of the navy; and section immediately following, provides that all marine officers shall be credited with the length of time that they have been employed as officers or enlisted men in the volunteer service of the United States. Sections very clearly place the non-commissioned officers, musicians, or privates of the marine corps under the orders of the secretary of the navy, with reference to their performance in the capitol grounds, or the president's grounds, and with reference to their rate of pay and their rations. Section declares that the mari e corps shall at all times be subject to the laws and regulations established for the government of the navy, except when detached for service with the army by order of the president, and, when so detached, shall be subject to the rules and articles of war prescribed for the government of the army. Section which relates to the retirement of officers with rank and pay, enacts that, in the case of an officer of the marine corps, the retiring board shall be selected by the secretary of the navy, under the direction of the president. Two-fifths of the board shall be selected from the medical corps of the navy, and the remainder from the officers of the marine corps.
10
11
It seems to us that these provisions of the Revised Statutes, bringing together the enactments of congress on the subject of the marine corps, show that the primary position of that body in the military service is that of a part of the navy, and its chief control is placed under the secretary of the navy, there being exceptions, when it may, by order of the president, or some one having proper authority, be placed more immediately, for temporary duty, with the army, and under the command of the superior army officers.
11
12
This view of the subject was taken by this court in the case of Wilkes v. Dinsman, 7 How. 89. Dinsman was a private in the marine corps under Commodore Wilkes in the exploring expedition, and, his term of service having expired, he entered into a contract for re-emlistment to serve until the return of the vessel. The act which authorized his re-enlistment applied to seaman, and to service of anybody enlisted for the navy. Dinsman was subjected to severe discipline by the orders of Commodore Wilkes, for which he brought this suit in the nature of an action of trespass, and alleged that, after the expiration of his service, he was not lawfully re-enlisted, as he was not a seamen when enlisted for the navy by reason of his being in the marine corps. The court examined into this question, and held that he belonged at that time to the navy, saying, among other things: 'Though marines are not, in some senses, 'seamen,' and their duties are in some respects different, yet they are, while employed on board public vessels, persons in the naval service, persons subject to the orders of naval officers, persons under the government of the naval code as to punishment, and persons amenable to the navy department. Their very name of 'marines' indicates the place and nature of their duties generally. And, besides the analogies of their duties in other countries, their first creation here to serve on board ships expressly declared them to be a part 'of the crews of each of said ships.' Act March 27, 1794, (1 St. at Large, Their pay was also to be fixed in the same way as that of the seamen. Section So it was again by the act of April 27, 1798, (1 St. at Large, ) And they have ever since been associated with the navy, except when specially detailed by the president for service in the army. * * * Thus paid, thus serving, and thus governed like and with the navy, it is certainly no forced construction to consider them as embraced in the spirit of the act of by the description of persons 'enlisted for the navy." And referring to the act of June 30, 1834, the provision of which is found in section of the Revised Statutes, 'that the said corps shall at all times be subject to and under the laws and regulations which are or may hereafter be established, for the better government of the navy,' the opinion says that this strengthens the conclusion of the court, and that that corps thus, in some respects, became still more closely identified with the navy.
12
13
Whatever view may be taken, it cannot be considered as a distinct military organization, independent of the departments of the army and navy, and under the supervision and control of neither of them, having no superior outside of its own officers, except the president. Such a position is at war with the whole policy of the distribution of power among the executive departments, as we have already shown; and while it may be true that it is not so exclusively a part of the navy as ships and navy-yards are, yet its general supervision and control remain with the navy department. We think that the act of under which this suit is brought, providing for a credit for the actual time of service in the army or navy, or both, is comprehensive enough to include the services of George Dunn, recited in the second finding of the court, as they must have been rendered either in the one or the other,—either in the army or the navy; and if rendered in either, or part in one and part in the other, they still entitle the claimant to receive compensation on the basis of services coming within the statute.

The judgment of the court of claims is affirmed.

Section 3 of the act of congress approved March ) provides as follows:

2
'Sec. 3. That if any male person, in a territory or other place over which the United States have exclusive jurisdiction, hereafter cohabits with more than one woman, he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars, or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.'

The grand jury of the United States for November term, in the district court of the First judicial district in and for the territory of Utah, on the fifth of December, presented and filed in that court, in open court, three several indictments, in the name of the United States, against Lorenzo Snow, each of them found December 2, designated as No. and No. Each of them was founded on the foregoing statute, and they were alike in all respects, except that each covered a different period of time. No. alleged that Snow, on the first of January, 'at the county of Box Elder, in the said district, territory aforesaid, and within the jurisdiction of this court, and on divers other days and times thereafter, and continuously between said first day of January, A. D. and the thirty-first day of December, A. D. did then and there unlawfully live and cohabit with more than one woman, to-wit, with Adeline Snow, Sarah Snow, Harriet Snow, Eleanor Snow, Mary H. Snow, Phoebe W. Snow, and Minnie Jensen Snow; and during all the period aforesaid, at the county aforesaid, he, the said Lorenzo Snow, did unlawfully claim, live, and cohabit with all of said women as his wives.' No. alleged that Snow, on the first of January, 'and on divers other days and times thereafter, and continuously between said first day of January, A. D. and the first day of December, A. D. did then and there unlawfully live and cohabit with more than one woman, to-wit, with' the seven persons above named, 'and during all the period aforesaid' 'did unlawfully claim, live, and cohabit with all of said women as his wives.' No. alleged that Snow, on the first of January, 'and on divers other days and times thereafter, and continuously between said first day of January, A. D. and the thirty-first day of December, A. D. did then and there unlawfully live and cohabit with more than on woman, to-wit, with' the seven persons above named, 'and during all the period aforesaid' 'did unlawfully claim, live, and cohabit with all of said women as his wives.'

At the time of filing each indictment it was properly indorsed 'a true bill, etc., and with the names of the witnesses.' The same 16 witnesses were examined before the grand jury, 'on one oath and one examination, as to the alleged offense during the entire time mentioned in all of said three indictments, and' they were found 'upon the testimony of witnesses given on an examination covering the whole time specified in said three indictments.' On the eleventh of December, 1885, the defendant was arraigned on each of the three indictments, and interposed a demurrer to each, which being overruled, he pleaded not guilty to each. Indictment No. was first tried, covering the period from and including January 1, 1885, to December 1, 1885. On the thirty-first of December, 1885, a verdict of guilty was rendered, and the court fixed the sixteenth of January, 1886, as the time for passing sentence.

Indictment No. was next tried, covering the period from and including January 1, 1884, to December 31, 1884. The defendant orally put in an additional plea in bar, setting up his prior conviction on indictment No. and that the offense charged in all of the indictments was one continuous offense, and the same offense, and not divisible. On an oral demurrer to this plea, the demurrer was sustained. On the trial by the jury, a verdict of guilty was rendered on the fifth of January, 1886, and the court fixed the sixteenth of January, 1886, as the time for passing sentence. Indictment No. was next tried, covering the period from and including January 1, 1883, to December 31, 1883. The defendant orally put in an additional plea in bar, setting up his prior convictions on indictments Nos. and that the offense charged in all of the indictments was one continuous offense, and the same offense, and not divisible. On an oral demurrer to this plea, the demurrer was sustained. On the trial by the jury, a verdict of guilty was rendered on the fifth of January, 1886, and the court fixed the sixteenth of January, 1886, as the time for passing sentence.

'The defendant, and his counsel, F. S. Richards and C. C. Richards, Esq'rs, (of counsel,) came into court. The defendant was duly informed of the nature of the indictments found against him on the fifth day of December, by the grand jury of this court, for the crime of unlawful cohabitation, committed as stated in said indictments, and during the time, as follows, viz.: Indictment No. between the first day of January, A. D. and the thirty-first day of December, A. D. indictment No. between the first day of January, A. D. and the first day of December, A. D. indictment No. between the first day of January, A. D. and the thirty-first day of December, A. D. of his arraignment and plea of not guilty as charged in said three indictments, on the sixteenth day of December, A. D. of his trial and the verdicts of the juries; indictment No. 'Guilty as charged in the indictment,' on December 31, indictment No. 'Guilty as charged in the indictment,' on January 5, 1886; indictment No. 'Guilty as charged in the indictment,' on January 5, 1886. The said defendant was then asked if he had any legal cause to show why judgment should not be pronounced against him, to which he replied that he had none; and no sufficient cause being shown or appearing to the court, thereupon the court renders its judgment that, whereas said Lorenzo Snow having been duly convicted in this court of the crime of unlawful cohabitation, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed that said Lorenzo Snow be imprisoned in the penitentiary of the territory o Utah for a period of six months, and that he do forfeit and pay to the United States a fine of three hundred dollars, and the costs of this prosecution, and that he do stand committed into the custody of the U. S. marshal for said territory until such fine and costs be paid in full. (As to indictment No. ) And it is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed that, at the expiration of the sentence and judgment rendered on said indictment No. said Lorenzo Snow be imprisoned in the penitentiary of Utah territory for a period of six months, and that he do forfeit and pay to the United States the sum of three hundred dollars, and the costs of this prosecution, and that he do stand committed into the custody of the U. S. marshal for said territory until such fine and costs be paid in full. (As to indictment No. ) And it is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed that, at the expiration of the sentence and judgment as last above rendered on said indictment No. said Lorenzo Snow be imprisoned in the penitentiary of Utah territory for a period of six months, and that he do forfeit and pay to the United States the sum of three hundred dollars, and the costs of this prosecution, and that he do stand committed into the custody of the U. S. marshal for said territory until such fine and costs be paid in full. (As to indictment No. ) The said defendant, Lorenzo Snow, is remanded into the custody of the United States marshal for Utah territory, to be by him delivered into the custody of the warden or other proper officer in charge of said penitentiary; and said warden or other proper officer of said penitentiary is hereby commanded to receive of and from the said United States marshal, him, the said Lorenzo Snow, convicted and sentenced as aforesaid, and him, the said Lorenzo Snow, keep and imprison in said penitentiary for the periods as in this judgment ordered and specified.

'ORLANDO W. POWERS, Judge.'

On the twenty-second of October, 1886, the defendant filed in the district court of the Third judicial district of the territory of Utah a petition setting forth that he is a prisoner confined in the penitentiary of the territory of Utah, 'by virtue of the warrant, judgment, and proceedings of record, including three indictments against your petitioner, his arraignment thereon, and pleas thereto, respectively, as well as demurrers to such pleas, decisions thereof, and verdicts of the jury, being the record of said matters in the district court of the First judicial district of the territory of Utah,' copies of all which papers, 16 in number, were annexed to the petition; that, under said judgment, and in execution thereof, he had been imprisoned in said penitentiary for more than six months, to-wit, continuously since the twelfth day of March, 1886, and had paid $in satisfaction of the fine adjudged against him, and 'all the costs awarded and assessed against him on said prosecution;' that his imprisonment is illegal in that 'the court had no jurisdiction to pass judgment' against him 'upon more than one of the indictments or records referred to in its said judgment, for the reason that the offense therein set out is the same as that contained and set out in each of the other said indictments and records, and the maximum punishment which the court had authority to impose was six months' imprisonment and a fine of three hundred dollars;' and 'that by his said imprisonment your petitioner is being punished twice for one and the same offense.' The prayer is for a writ of habeas corpus, to the end that the petitioner may be discharged from custody.
10
11
On a hearing on the petition the following order was made by the court, on the twenty-third of October, 1886: 'The petition of Lorenzo Snow for a writ of habeas corpus having been presented to the court, with the exhibits attached as a part thereof, and the court having fully considered the application and petition and the exhibits attached, finds that the facts alleged and shown by thep etition and exhibits are insufficient to authorize the issuance of the writ; and the court being of the opinion, from the allegations and facts stated in the petition and exhibits, that, if the writ be granted and a hearing given, the petitioner could not be discharged from custody, it is ordered and adjudged by the court that the said application for a writ of habeas corpus be, and the same is hereby, refused; to which ruling and refusal applicant, by his counsel, excepts.' From this order and judgment the petitioner has appealed to this court.
11
12
There can be no doubt that the action of the district court, as set forth in its order and judgment refusing to issue the writ, was, so far as an appeal is concerned, equivalent to a refusal to discharge the petitioner on a hearing on the return to a writ; and that, under section of the Revised Statutes, an appeal lies to this court from that order and judgment. It is contended for the United States that, as the court which tried the indictments had jurisdiction over the offenses charged in them, it had jurisdiction to determine the questions raised by the demurrers to the oral pleas in bar in the cases secondly and thirdly tried; that it tried those questions; that those questions are the same which are raised in the present proceeding; that they cannot be reviewed on habeas corpus by any court; and that they could only be re-examined here on a writ of error, if one were authorized. For these propositions the case of Ex parte Bigelow, Sup. Ct. Rep. is cited. But, for the reasons hereafter stated, we are of opinion that the decision in that case does not apply to the present one.
12
13
The offense of cohabiting with more than one woman, in the sense of the section of the statute on which the indictments were founded, may be committed by a man by living in the same house with two women whom he had theretofore acknowledged as his wives, and eating at their respective tables, and holding them out to the world by his language or conduct, or both, as his wives, though he may not occupy the same bed or sleep in the same room with them, or either of them, or have sexual intercourse with either of them. The offense of cohabitation, in the sense of this statute, is committed if there is a living or dwelling together as husband and wife. It is, inherently, a continuous offense, having duration; and not an offense consisting of an isolated act. That it was intended in that sense in these indictments is shown by the fact that in each the charge laid is that the defendant did on the day named and 'thereafter and continuously,' for the time specified, 'live and cohabit with more than one woman, to-wit with' the seven women named, and 'during all the period aforesaid' 'did unlawfully claim, live, and cohabit with all of said women as his wives.' Thus, in each indictment, the offense is laid as a continuing one and a single one for all the time covered by the indictment; and, taking the three indictments together, there is charged a continuing offense for the entire time covered by all three of the indictments. There was but a single offense committed prior to the time the indictments were found. This appears on the face of the judgment. It refers to the indictments as found 'for the crime of unlawful cohabitation committed' 'during the time' stated, divided into three periods, according to each indictment. For so much of the offense as covered each of these periods the defendant is, according to the judgment, to be imprisoned for six months and to pay a fine of $ The division of the two years and eleven months is wholly arbitrary. On the same principle there might have been an indictment covering each of the 35 months, with imprisonment for years and fines amounting to $ or even an indictment covering every week, with imprisonment for 74 years and fines amounting to $ and so on, ad infinitum, for smaller periods of time. It is to prevent such an application f penal laws that the rule has obtained that a continuing offense of the character of the one in this case can be committed but once, for the purposes of indictment or prosecution, prior to the time the prosecution is instituted. Here each indictment charged unlawful cohabitation with the same seven women; all the indictments were found at the same time, by the same grand jury, and on the testimony of the same witnesses, covering a continuous period of 35 months; and it was the mere will of the grand jury which divided the time among three indictments, and stopped short of dividing it among or even more. It was quite in consonance with this action that the prosecuting officer tried the indictments in the inverse order of the time to which each related,—that for first, that for next, and that for last. Hence the defendant could not, on any trial, plead or show that he had before been tried on an indictment in respect to a period of time antedating that laid in the indictment on trial. Then, after the verdicts, there was not a separate judgment in each case; but only one judgment in form was rendered for all the cases. The judgment says on its face that the proper officer of the penitentiary is to imprison the defendant therein 'for the periods as in this judgment ordered and specified;' that is, for three successive periods of six months each, the first period to apply to the indictment thirdly tried; the second period to apply to the indictment first tried, and to begin when the sentence and judgment on the indictment thirdly tried should expire; and the third period to apply to the indictment secondly tried, and to begin when the sentence and judgment on the indictment secondly tried should expire. No case is cited where what has been done in the present case has been held to be lawful. But the uniform current of authority is to the contrary, both in England and in the United States.
13
14
A leading case on the subject in England is Crepps v. Durden, Cowp. In that case the statute (29 Car. II. c. 7) provided 'that no tradesman or other person shall do or exercise any worldly labor, business, or work of their ordinary calling on the Lord's day, works of necessity and charity only excepted.' A penalty of five shillings was affixed to each offense, and it was made cognizable by a justice of the peace. Crepps, a baker, was convicted before Durden, a justice, by four separate convictions, 'of selling small hot loaves of bread, the same not being any work of charity, on the same day, being Sunday,' in violation of that statute. Durden issued four warrants, one on each conviction, to officers, who, under them, levied four penalties, of five shillings each, on the goods of Crepps. The latter sued Durden and the others, in trespass, in the king's bench, in 1777, and had a verdict before Lord MANFIELD for three sums of five shillings each, subject to the opinion of the court. The first question raised was whether, in the action of trespass, and before the convictions were quashed, their legality could be objected to; and, next, whether the levy under the last three warrants could be justified. It was contended for the plaintiff that the last three convictions were in excess of the jurisdiction of the justice, because the offense created by the statute was the exercising of a calling on the Lord's day, and, if the plaintiff had continued baking from morning till night, it would still be but one offense; that the four convictions were for one and the same offense; and that an action would lie against the justice and the officers. On the other side it was urged that, as the justice had general jurisdiction of the offense in question, the convictions must be quashed or reversed on appeal before they could be questioned. At a subsequent day the unanimous opinion of the court was delivered by Lord MANSFIELD. He first considered the question whether the legality of the convictions could be objected to before they were quashed. A to this he said: 'Here are three convictions of a baker for exercising his trade on one and the same day, he having been before convicted for exercising his ordinary calling on that identical day. If the act of parliament gives authority to levy but one penalty, there is an end of the question; for there is no penalty at common law. On the construction of the act of parliament the offense is 'exercising his ordinary trade upon the Lord's day,' and that without any fractions of a day, hours, or minutes. It is but one entire offense, whether longer or shorter in point of duration. So, whether it consists of one or of a number of particular acts, the penalty incurred for this offense is five shillings. There is no idea conveyed by the act itself that, if a tailor sews on the Lord's day, every stitch he takes is a separate offense; or, if a shoemaker or carpenter work for different customers at different times on the same Sunday, that those are so many separate and distinct offenses. There can be but one entire offense on one and the same day. And this is a much stronger case than that which has been alluded to, of killing more hares than one on the same day. Killing a single hare is an offense; but the killing ten more on the same day will not multiply the offense or the penalty imposed by the statute for killing one. Here repeated offenses are not the object which the legislature had in view in making the statute, but singly, to punish a man for exercising his ordinary trade and calling on a Sunday. Upon this construction, the justice had no jurisdiction whatever in respect of the three last convictions. How, then, can there be a doubt but that the plaintiff might take this objection at the trial?' As to justifying the levy under the last three warrants Lord MANSFIELD said: 'But what could the justification have been in this case, if any had been attempted to be set up? It could only have been this: That, because the plaintiff had been convicted of one offense on that day, therefore the justice had convicted him in three other offenses for the same act. By law that is no justification. It is illegal on the face of it; and therefore, as was very rightly admitted by the counsel for the defendant in the argument, if put upon the record by way of plea, would have been bad, and on demurrer must have been so adjudged. Most clearly, then, it was open to the plaintiff, upon the general issue, to take advantage of it at the trial. The question does not turn upon niceties; upon a computation how many hours distant the several bakings happened; or upon the fact of which conviction was prior in point of time; or that for uncertainty in that respect they should all four be held bad. But it goes upon the ground that the offense itself can be committed only once in the same day.'
14
15
In the case at bar the statute provides that, if any male person shall thereafter cohabit with more than one woman, he shall, on conviction, be punished thus and so. The judgment in the case, taken in connection with the other proceedings in the record and the statute, shows, within the principle of Crepps v. Durden, that there was but one entire offense, whether longer or shorter in point of duration, between the earliest day laid in any indictment and the latest day laid in any. There can be but one offense between such earliest day and the end of the continuous time embraced by all of the indictments. Not only had the court which tried them no jurisdiction to inflict a punishment in respect of more than one of the convictions, but, as the want of jurisdiction appears on the face of the judgment, the objection may be taken on habeas corpus when the sentence on more than one of the convictions is sought to be enforced. If such an objection could be taken in Crepps v. Durden, in a collateral action for damages, it can be taken on a a habeas corpus to release the party from imprisonment under the illegal judgment. These considerations distinguish the case from that f Ex parte Bigelow, ubi supra, and bring it within the principle of such cases as Ex parte Milligan, Ex parte Lange, and Ex parte Wilson, Sup. Ct. Rep. 
15
16
A distinction is laid down in adjudged cases and in text-writers between an offense continuous in its character, like the one at bar, and a case where the statute is aimed at an offense that can be committed uno ictu. The subject is discussed in 1 Whart. Crim. Law, ( and the cases on the subject are cited.
16
17
The principle which governs the present case has been recognized and approved in many cases in the United States. Washburn v. McInroy, ( Mayor v. Ordrenan, ( Tiffany v. Driggs, ( State v. Com'rs, ( U. S. v. McCormick (Cranch. C. C. State v. Nutt, ( State v. Lindley, ( Sturgis v. Spofford, ( Fisher v. New York Cent. & H. R. R. Co., ( State v. Egglesht, ( U. S. v. New York Guaranty & Indemnity Co., ( U. S. v. Erie Ry. Co., (.
17
18
The case of Com. v. Connors, gives no support to the view that a grand jury may divide a single continuous offense running through a past period of time into such parts as it may please, and call each part a separate offense. On the contrary, in Com. v. Robinson, it is said that the offense of keeping a tenement for the illegal sale of intoxicating liquors on a day named, and on divers other days and times between that day and a subsequent day, is but one offense, even though the tenement is kept during every hour of the time between those two days, such offense being continuous in its character.
18
19
On the whole case we are unanimously of opinion that the order and judgment of the district court for the Third judicial district of Utah territory must be reversed, and the case be remanded to that court, with a direction to grant the writ of habeas corpus prayed for, and to take such proceedings thereon as may be in conformity with law and not inconsistent with the opinion of this court.

FARLEY
v.
KITTSON and others.1
February 7, 1887.
1
A brief extract of the pleadings will help to make clear what is presented for decision upon this record. The suit was brought by Farley to enforce an agreement by which he and the defendants Kittson and Hill agreed to purchase, for their joint and equal benefit, the bonds, secured by mortgages, of two railroads, of one of which he was receiver, by appointment of the court, and of the other of which he was the general manager, by appointment of the trustees named in the mortgages. The bill alleged the making of the agreement; that its object was, by means of the bonds so purchased, to purchase the railroads at sales under decrees of foreclosure in suits then pending; that it was agreed that Kittson and Hill should conduct the negotiations for procuring the necessary funds and purchasing the bonds, and the plaintiff should furnish such facts, information, and advice, and render such assistance, from time to time, as should be required of him; that the plaintiff had knowledge, not possessed by the other parties, as to who held the bonds, and at what rate and how they could be procured, and as to the nature and value of the railroads, and as to the pending suits for forclosure, and his services and co-operation were indispensable to the success of the enterprise; that he performed the agreement on his part; that Kittson and Hill obtained the requisite funds from other persons, and purchased the bonds from the bondholders through one Kennedy, the authorized agent of the latter, and afterwards purchased the railroads at sales under decrees of foreclosure; that pending the negotiations for the purchase of the bonds, the plaintiff informed Kennedy of his interest and his connection with Kittson and Hill in the project to purchase them; that the plaintiff at all times, to the best of his knowledge and ability, gave full and true answers and information to all inquiries made by Kennedy, or by any of the trustees or bondholders, or by any person interested in the property under his charge as receiver and as manager, and kept Kennedy fully informed of all matters coming to his knowledge affecting the property, and in all things acted honestly and in good faith towards all persons interested in it; that Kittson and Hill had organized a new corporation, which was joined as a defendant; and that the defendants had thereby obtained a great amount of property and of profits, and had refused to account to plaintiff for his share. The bill prayed for a discovery, an account, and other relief.
1
2
The individual defendants filed a plea, which, on the motion of the defendant and corporation, was ordered to stand as its plea also, consisting of three parts: First. A restatement in detail of some of the facts alleged generally in the bill. Second. Averments that the plaintiff never informed Kennedy or any of the bondholders of his interest in the project for purchasing the bonds, and thereby acquiring the mortgaged property, as alleged in the bill, and that neither Kennedy nor the bondholders knew, suspected, or had any information or belief that the plaintiff had or claimed to have any interest in the project until after the foreclosure sales. Third. Averments that the making by the plaintiff of the agreement sued on, and his engaging in the enterprise of purchasing the bonds, and thereby acquiring the railroads, were, as to that railroad of which he was receiver, unlawful, a breach of his trust as such receiver, and a fraud upon the bondholders and the court; and, as to the railroad of which he was general manager for the trustees under the mortgages, a breach of trust towards the trustees and the bondholders, and a fraud upon them; and that, by reason of the fiduciary positions so occupied by him, the plaintiff was not entitled to the aid of a court of equity to enforce the agreement, or any rights growing out of it. To this plea the plaintiff filed a general replication, and the hearing in the circuit court was upon the issue thus joined.
2
3
The pleader ad the court below appear to have proceeded upon the theory that, by a plea in equity, a defendant may aver certain facts in addition to or contradiction of those alleged in the bill; and also, not only, if he proves his averments, avail himself of objections in matter of law to the case stated in the bill, as modified by the facts proved, but even, if he fails to prove those facts, take any objection to the case stated in the bill which would have been open to him if he had demurred generally for want of equity. But the proper office of a plea is not, like an answer, to meet all the allegations of the bill, nor, like a demurrer, admitting those allegations, to deny the equity of the bill, but it is to present some distinct fact, which of itself creates a bar to the suit, or to the part to which the plea applies, and thus to avoid the necessity of making the discovery asked for, and the expense of going into the evidence at large. Mitf. Eq. Pl. ( Story, Eq. Pl. §§ .

4
The plaintiff may either set down the plea for argument, or file a replication to it. If he sets down the plea for argument, he thereby admits the truth of all the facts stated in the plea, and merely denies their sufficiency in point of law to prevent his recovery. If, on the other hand, he replies to the plea, joining issue upon the facts averred in it, and so puts the defendant to the trouble and expense of proving his plea, he thereby, according to the English chancery practice, admits that, if the particular facts stated in the plea are true, they are sufficient in law to bar his recovery; and if they are proved to be true, the bill must be dismissed, without reference to the equity arising from any other facts stated in the bill. Mift. Eq. Pl. Story, Eq. Pl. § That practice in this particular has been twice recognized by this court. Hughes v. Blake, Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, But the case of Rhode Island v. Massachusetts arose within its original jurisdiction in equity, for outlines of the practice in which the court has always looked to the practice of the court of chancery in England. Rule Cranch, xvii. and 1 How. xxiv.; Rule How. v. and Sup. Ct. Rep. v. And the case of Hughes v. Blake, which began in the circuit court, was decided here in 1821, before this court, under the authority conferred upon it by congress, had established the rules of practice in equity in the courts of the United States, one of which provides that 'if, upon an issue, the facts stated in the plea be determined for the defendant, they shall avail him as far as in law and equity they ought to avail him.' Rule 19 in Equity of Wheat. xix.; Rule 32 in Equity of How. li. The effect of this rule of court, when the issue of fact joined on a plea is determined in the defendant's favor, need not, however, be considered in this case, because it is quite clear that, at a hearing upon plea, replication, and proofs, no fact is in issue between the parties, but the truth of the matter pleaded. In a case so heard, decided by this court in 1808, Chief Justice MARSHALL said: 'In this case the merits of the claim cannot be examined. The only questions before this court are upon the sufficiency of the plea to bar the action, and the sufficiency of the testimony to support the plea as pleaded.' Stead v. Course, In a case before the house of lords a year afterwards, Lord REDESDALE 'observed that a plea was a special answer to a bill, differing in this from an answer in the common form, as it demanded the judgment of the court, in the first instance, whether the special matter urged by it did not debar the plaintiff from his title to that answer which the bill required. If a plea were allowed, nothing remained in issue between the parties, so far as the plea extended, but the truth of the matter pleaded.' 'Upon a pleaa llowed, nothing is in issue between the parties but the matter pleaded, and the averments added to support the plea.' 'Upon argument of a plea, every fact stated in the bill, and not denied by answer in support of the plea, must be taken for true.' Roche v. Morgell, 2 Schoales & L. 
4

The distinction between a demurrer and a plea dates as far back as the time of Lord BACON, by the fifty-eighth of whose ordinances for the administration of justice in chancery 'a demurrer is properly upon matter defective contained in the bill itself, and no foreign matter; but a plea is of foreign matter, to discharge or stay the suit, as that the cause hath been formerly dismissed, or that the plaintiff is outlawed or excommunicated, or there is another bill depending for the same cause, or the like.' Ord. Ch. (Beames' Ed.) 26. Lord REDESDALE, in his treatise on Pleadings, says: 'A plea must aver facts to which the plaintiff may reply, and not, in the nature of a demurrer, rest on facts in the bill.' Mitf. Eq. Pl. And Mr. Jeremy, in a note to this passage commenting on the ordinance of Lord Bacon, observes: 'The prominent distinction between a plea and a demurrer here noticed is strictly true, even of that description of plea which is termed negative; for it is the affirmative of the proposition which is stated in the bill.' In other words, a plea, which avers that a certain fact is not as the bill affirms it to be, sets up matter not contained in the bill. That an objection to the equity of the plaintiff's claim as stated in the bill must be taken by demurrer, and not by plea, is so well established that it has been constantly assumed, and therefore seldom stated in judicial opinions; yet there are instances in which it has been explicitly recognized by other courts of chancery, as well as by this court. Billing v. Flight, Steff v. Andrews, 2 Madd. 6; Varick v. Dodge, Phelps v. Garrow, Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, National Bank v. Insurance Co., It only remains to apply these elementary principles of equity pleading to the case before us.
5
6
The averments in the first part of the plea, restating in detail some of the facts alleged in the bill, were admitted by stipulation of counsel in writing to be true, and no controversy arose upon them. The substance of the averments in the second part of the plea was that neither Kennedy, nor the bondholders whose agent and representative he was, had any notice or knowledge that the plaintiff had or claimed to have any interest in the project set forth in the bill, until after the sales of the railroads under decrees of foreclosure. The matter of fact thus averred was put in issue by the replication. The testimony of the plaintiff, in connection with Kennedy's letter to him, which was uncontradicted, and was the only evidence upon the matter pleaded, shows that Kennedy, before the completion of the sale and purchase of the bonds, knew that the plaintiff was to have an interest in the project, although he may not have known the extent of that interest, or that it had been already acquired. The want of any notice to Kennedy and the bondholders, averred in the plea, was thus disproved. The plea, indeed, is supported by the affidavit of one of the defendants that it is true in point of fact. But the oath of the party to its truth in point of fact is added only for the same purpose as the certificate of counsel that in their opinion it is well founded in matter of law, in order to comply with the thirty-first rule in equity, the object to which is to prevent a defendant from delaying or evading the discovery sought, without showing that the plea is worthy of the consideration of the court. Ewing v. Bright, Wall v. Stubbs, An answer under oath is evidence in favor of the defendant, because made in obedience to the demand of theb ill for a discovery, and therefore only so far as it is responsive to the bill. Seitz v. Mitchell, But a plea, which avoids the discovery prayed for, is no evidence in the defendant's favor, even when it is under oath, and negatives a material averment in the bill. Heartt v. Corning.

The allegations of the bill that the plaintiff at all times, to the best of his knowledge and ability, gave full and true answers to all inquiries made by Kennedy or any of the trustees or bondholders, or any person interested in the property under his charge as receiver and as manager, and in all things acted honestly and in good faith towards all persons interested in it, were not denied by the plea, and therefore, for the purposes of the hearing thereon, were conclusively admitted to be true. So much of the plaintiff's testimony as tended to show that he intentionally concealed his interest from the stockholders and from the court was outside of the averments of the plea, and therefore irrelevant to the issue to be tried. The plaintiff having neither moved to set aside the plea as irregular for want of an answer supporting it, nor set down the case for hearing upon the bill and plea only, but having replied to the plea, and the only issue of fact thus joined having been determined by the evidence in his favor, it is unnecessary to consider whether the averments of fact in the second part of the plea ought to have been supported by an answer, or whether, if proved, they would have made out a defense to the bill. The averments in the third part of the plea that, by reason of the plaintiff's position as receiver and general manager of the railroads, his entering into the agreement sued on, and engaging in the enterprise of purchasing the bonds and thereby acquiring the railroads, were unlawful, and did not entitle him to the aid of a court of equity to enforce the agreement or any rights growing out of it, were averments of pure matter of law, arising upon the plaintiff's case as stated in the bill, and affecting the equity of the bill, and therefore a proper subject of demurrer, and not to be availed of by plea. The result is that the principle question considered by the court below and argued at the bar is not presented in a form to be decided upon the record before us; and that, for the reasons above stated, and as suggested in behalf of the plaintiff at the reargument, the plea was erroneously sustained, and must be overruled, and the defendants ordered, in accordance with the thirty-fourth rule in equity, to answer the bill.

Decree reversed, and case remanded with directions to overrule the plea, and to order the defendants to answer the bill.

A statute of Florida, approved February 22, 1881, contains the following provisions:

'Sec. 1. The verdict in actions of ejectment shall, when for the plaintiff, state the quantity of the estate of the plaintiff, and describe the land by its metes and bounds, by the number of the lot, or other certain description.

This was an action of ejectment, and the verdict, which was for the plaintiff, did not state the quantity of the estate, or describe the land. This is assigned for error, among others, and Perry, the defendant in error, in the brief which has been filed in his behalf, confesses that the judgment in his favor is thereby vitiated. Without considering any of the other errors assigned, therefore, we reverse the judgment on this ground alone, and remand the cause for a new trial. Reversed.

SHERMAN, ADM'r, etc., and others
v.
JEROME and another, Ex'rs, etc.
February 7, 1887.
 Sarah E. Little, then a resident of Perry, Wyoming county, New York, died at that place, leaving a last will and testament, executed August 30, 1872, and a codicil thereto, executed September 9, 1872. The will, after giving sundry money legacies, proceeded as follows: 'Fourth. I give and bequeath to Charlotte Sherman the interest of four thousand dollars, during the term of her natural life, and at her decease the said sum of four thousand dollars shall be equally divided between Maria Cameron, Sarah E. Morse, and James Sherman, children of C. A. W. Sherman, or so many of them as shall then be living.' By subsequent articles other money legacies were given, and then followed these articles: 'Twenty-second. All bequests herein contained to persons residing in New York, and that to Maria Cameron, I desire paid first, and the remainder as fast as the money is available.' 'Twenty-sixth. I hereby appoint Henry N. Page my executor for carrying out the provisions of this my last will and testament, so far as they relate to parties and property in this state, (in New York,) and Charles W. Grant, of East Saginaw, and D. H. Jerome, of Saginaw city, Michigan, my executors for everything, so far as they relate to parties and property in the state of Michigan and elsewhere; and my executors are hereby authorized and empowered to sell and convey any real estate of which I may be possessed as they shall deem for the best interest of the legatees.' On the twenty-fourth of December, 1881, the present suit in equity was brought, in the circuit court of the United States for the Eastern district of Michigan, by Charles A. W. Sherman, as administrator of Charlotte Sherman, deceased, Maria Cameron, James Sherman, and Sarah E. Morse, against David H. Jerome and Charles W. Grant. The bill sets out the foregoing provisions of Little's will, and states these facts: Charles A. W. Sherman is the C. A. W. Sherman named in the will. Charlotte Sherman was his wife, and died in May, 1880, and he was appointed her administrator in December, 1881. In January, 1873, the will of Little was proved before the surrogate of Wyoming county, New York, and letters testamentary were issued to Page, named in it as executor. In March, 1873, letters testamentary on the will of Little were issued by the probate court for Saginaw county, Michigan, to Grant and Jerome. in New York, and Grant and Jerome, in Michigan, entered upon their duties as executors. In New York, Little left property not exceeding a few hundred dollars in amount, which went into the hands of Page, and was used in defraying funeral expenses, leaving nothing in his hands with which to pay the legacies. Little left a large real and personal estate in Saginaw county, Michigan, which came into the hands ofG rant and Jerome, as executors, and they have now in their hands a greater amount of the estate than is sufficient to pay to the plaintiffs their legacies and to pay all the other legacies. Grant and Jerome paid to Charlotte Sherman the interest on the $down to April 1, 1876; but nothing more has been paid on the legacies to the plaintiffs. Maria Cameron, Sarah E. Morse, and James Sherman were living at the time of the death of Charlotte Sherman, and are still living. The bill prays for an accounting by the defendants, as executos, and for the payment to the plaintiffs of the amounts due to them for the legacies.

2
The answer admits that a part of the estate left by Little in Michigan came into the hands of Grant, and a part into the hands of Jerome. It avers that, aside from the Coats bond and mortgage hereafter mentioned, Grant has none of the estate now in his hands, and Jerome has $ including any fees, commissions, or compensation for his services. Accounts of receipts and disbursements by each defendant, as executor, are annexed to the answer. It then sets forth that the defendants believed it to be their duty to set apart and invest, out of the estate, $ the interest of which, as they should be able to collect it, should be paid to Charlotte Sherman during her life-time, and the principal be retained by them in such investment, and, after her decease, be paid over to Maria Cameron, Sarah E. Morse, and James Sherman; that, for that purpose, they took out of the estate and set apart a bond executed by one Coats to Little, in the penalty of $ dated May 1, 1869, conditioned to pay $May with interest annually on all sums unpaid at 10 per cent., and a mortgage given to secure the bond, bearing the same date, executed by Coats to Little, mortgaging a parcel of land in East Saginaw, Saginaw county, Michigan, and recorded in the office of the register of deeds for Saginaw county; that, to set apart the bond and mortgage, they, on the twentieth of October, 1874, executed and acknowledged the following instrument in writing, which was recorded in the office of said register of deeds on the same day:

'Whereas, by the last will and testament of Sarah E. Little, the interest of sum of four thousand dollars is bequeathed to Charlotte Sherman for her life, and upon her decease the said sum of four thousand dollars is to be divided between parties therein named; and whereas, among the assets of the estate of said Sarah E. Little is a bond and mortgage made by Alice L. Coats to said Sarah E. Little, dated May 1, 1869, for the sum of five thousand dollars, on which there is now due four thousand dollars, and which mortgage is recorded in the office of the register of deeds of Saginaw county, Michigan, in Liber O of Mortgages, on pages Now, therefore, we, the undersigned, executors of the said will, do hereby set apart for the benefit of said Charlotte Sherman, and to be held by us in trust for the purpose of paying the said interest, and, upon her decease, for distribution among the persons named in said will, the said bond and mortgage.

By means whereof they set apart the bond and mortgage, as an investment in their hands, to be held by them as executors under the will, in trust, fromw hich to collect the interest on the sum of $ represented by the bond and mortgage, as principal, and pay the same to Charlotte Sherman, and to collect and receive the principal, and pay the same, in pursuance of the direction of the will, to Maria Cameron, Sarah E. Morse, and James Sherman; that they made the investment properly, and in accordance with their duty; that their action was, in effect, the same, in all respects as if they had taken the sum of $in money and purchased a security for that amount, or had loaned that sum on security for the purpose of obtaining interest and retaining the principal to meet the payment of the legacy; that the investment was made according to the best of their judgment, and in good faith; that they then believed the security was ample, and that the bond and mortgage were a desirable security for providing for the legacy; that Coats was then believed by the defendants to be worth, in her own right, the sum of at least $over and above the real estate covered by the mortgage; that they then believed also that the real estate was a good and sufficient security by itself to secure the payment of the $ and interest thereon; that the money secured by the bond and mortgage was not collected from Coats, because they believed the security, as it stood, was an entirely satisfactory and altogether desirable one, and an investment as good as they could make; that on such setting apart of the security, Charlotte Sherman was informed thereof, and thereafter Grant collected from Coats, on the bond and mortgage, four sums of $each, which he paid to her, he having, in January, 1874, paid to her $ all on account of her legacy; that no other sums have since been collected by the defendants on the bond and mortgage, and there is due thereon $of principal, and interest from May 1, 1876; that, when the interest ceased to be paid, the defendants notified Charlotte Sherman thereof, and asked her advice and direction as to foreclosing the mortgage, and since her death they have requested the advice and direction of the plaintiffs in regard to collecting the bond and mortgage, and have advised them of the setting apart of the security; that the defendants have offered, and now offer, to transfer the bond and mortgage to the plaintiffs; that they have paid $for taxes on the mortgaged land, which were a lien on it, and which should be reimbursed to them; that, since the investment, Charlotte Sherman and the plaintiffs have had no right to claim payment of any part of the legacy out of the estate of Little; and that the investment has remained the sole fund out of which the legacy should be paid. The answer then admits that the amount which came into the hands of the defendants from the estate of Little was sufficient, after paying all the debts of Little, to pay the legacy to the plaintiffs, and all the other legacies payable before that legacy, according to the directions of the will, but such amount and the estate was not sufficient to pay all the legacies, not including the residuary legacy. It then avers that, according to the provisions of the will, it was not their duty to pay over the $to Charlotte Sherman; and that the other legatees under the will always objected, after such investment had been made, to any other provision or payment being made out of the estate on account of that legacy. It was stipulated by the parties that Charles A. W. Sherman was administrator of Charlotte Sherman, and that Page had not, at the time of the filing of the bill, or at any time, any funds in his hands belonging to the estate of Little, except as alleged in the bill.

A decree was made, providing that the defendants, as executors, have in their hands and hold said bond and mortgage, in trust for the payment to the plaintiffs of the legacy specified in the fourth clause of the bill; that the plaintiffs are entitled to the payment of the proceeds of the bond an mortgage, after deducting therefrom the expenses of the collection thereof, and the amounts paid, and to be paid, by the defendants for taxes on the property covered by the mortgage, to preserve the lien thereof, and the costs of this suit; and that the defendants foreclose and collect the bond and mortgage, by proper legal proceedings, and, out of the proceeds, retain the necessary and reasonable costs and expenses of such fore closure and collection, and the amounts so paid, and to be paid, by them for taxes, and their costs of this suit, and pay the balance of the proceeds to the plaintiffs in payment and discharge of the legacy. From this decree the plaintiffs have appealed.

The only question necessary or proper to be disposed of on this appeal, in view of the pleadings and of the terms of the decree below, is whether the special matter alleged in regard to the setting apart of the bond and mortgage is a defense to the suit. At the time of the execution of the paper of October 20, 1874, the unpaid $secured by the bond and mortgage had been overdue more than 17 months. There is no suggestion that any of the legatees named in the fourth article of the will consented to the setting apart of the bond and mortgage, or that there was any order of any court on the subject. The fourth article gives directly to Charlotte Sherman the interest of $for life, and, at her decease, gives directly to such of the other three persons named as shall then be living 'the said sum of four thousand dollars,' to be equally divided among them. Under these circumstances, the execution of the paper of October 20, 1874, by the defendants, setting apart the bond and mortgage to be held by them in trust, even though the paper was put on record, amounted to no more than if they had retained the bond and mortgage, without executing any such paper, and had merely made a mental resolution to consider the bond and mortgage as set apart for this legacy. There was no second party to the paper, no transfer in it, no contract, and the beneficiaries never assented to it, or ratified it, or waived their rights; and, in the absence of any such action by the beneficiaries, it is revocable at any time. Without deciding what course, if any, might lawfully have been taken by the defendants, at the time in question, to effect the object they sought, we are of opinion that what they did was of no more avail to that end than the mere mental determination of the executor in Miller v. Congdon, Even though the mental determination took the shape of a written declared purpose, it did not amount to the decisive and irrevocable act which must exist to have the effect to transmute the property.

The decree of the circuit court is reversed, and the ease is remanded to that court, with a direction to take such further proceedings therein as shall not be inconsistent with this opinion.

UNITED STATES
v.
NORTHWAY.
February 7, 1887.
1
On the twenty-third of April, 1885, the grand jury for the Eastern division of the Northern district of Ohio returned an indictment, apparently founded upon section of the Revised Statutes, against Stephen A. Northway, as president and agent of the Second National Bank of Jefferson, a national banking association. On July 13, 1885, the record was, on motion of the district attorney, remitted to the circuit court. There are 59 counts in the indictment. All of these were quashed except counts to each of which the defendant interposed a general demurrer. This demurrer came on for hearing before the circuit court, composed of the circuit judge and the district judge for that district, who certify to us that on the hearing they were divided and opposed in opinion on the following questions: '(1) Whethe either of said counts charges defendant with an offense under the laws of the United States; (2) whether the charging of the defendant with committing the acts therein charged against him as 'president and agent' did not vitiate said counts of said indictment; (3) whether, under section of the Revised Statutes of the United States, it was necessary in the indictment to charge that the moneys and funds alleged to have been embezzled and misapplied, or either, had been previously intrusted to the defendant; (4) whether it is necessary, in charging said defendant with aiding and abetting Sylvester T. Fuller, cashier of said bank, as in counts sixteen, twenty-eight, and forty-six, with the misapplication of the funds of said bank, to charge that the defendant then and there knew that said Fuller was such cashier; (5) whether said second count sufficiently describes and identifies the crime of abstracting the funds of the bank created by the act of congress; (6) whether the indictment sufficiently states that the Second National Bank of Jefferson was organized under the national banking act, or to carry on the business of banking under a law of the United States.'
1
Section 5209 of the Revised Statutes, under which this indictment appears to have been drawn, is as follows:
2
 Every president, director, cashier, teller, clerk, or agent of any association, who embezzles, abstracts, or willfully misapplies any of the moneys, funds, or credits of the association; or who, without authority from the directors, issues or puts in circulation any of the notes of the association; or who, without such authority, issues or puts forth any certificate of deposit, draws any order or bill of exchange, makes any acceptance, assigns any note, bond, draft, bill of exchange, mortgage, judgment, or decree; or who makes any false entry in any book, report, or statement of the association, with intent, in either case, to injure or defraud the association or any other company, body politic or corporate, or any individual person, or to deceive any officer of the association, or any agent appointed to examine the affairs of any such association; and every person who, with like intent, aids or abets any officer, clerk, or agent in any violation of this section,—shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be imprisoned not less than five years, nor more than ten.'

We proceed to dispose of the several questions certified to us in their order.
4
5
1. The question whether either of said counts charges said defendant with an offense under the laws of the United States, which is the first one certified, we decline to answer, for the reason that it is too vague and general, within the act of congress authorizing certificates of this character and the repeated decisions of this court.
5
6
2. We are of opinion that charging the defendant with committing the acts therein charged against him as 'president and agent' did not vitiate the counts of the indictment in which that description is contained. The only grounds on which the contrary conclusion could be predicated are that the allegation is either too uncertain or is contradictory. The allegation is not uncertain, as it might have been if it had been 'president or agent.' In that case, it might have been urged that, as the offense was charged to have been committed by the defendant either as president or agent, it was uncertain in which of these capacities he was charged; for, although it might be said that a president is ex officio agent of the association, there may be many agents who are not president. Here the description is that he was 'president and agent,' and committed the offense charged in some capacity described by both terms. Neither is the description contradictory, because he may be both president and agent. There is no repugnance in the two characters. Even on the supposition that the statute means to make a distinction between the two offices of president and agent, there is nothing in the natue of either to prevent them both being held at the same time by one person, and the acts charged may, in contemplation of law, have been committed by him in both capacities. A fortiori may this be the case, if every president of such an association is to be held by virtue of his office to be also, within the meaning of the act, an agent of the association. In that case, the use of the words 'and agent' would be mere surplusage in the indictment. Being already in cluded within the meaning of the word 'president,' it does not add anything to the description to introduce the words 'and agent.' This question is therefore answered in the negative.
6
7
3. The twelfth count of the indictment charges that the defendant, with proper allegations of time and place, 'was then and there president and agent of a certain national banking association, to-wit, 'The Second National Bank of Jefferson,' theretofore duly organized and established, and then existing and doing business, in the village of Jefferson and county of Ashtabula, in the division and district aforesaid, under the laws of the United States; and the said Stephen A. Northway, as such president and agent, then and there had and received in and into his possession certain of the moneys and funds of said banking association, of the amount and value of twelve thousand dollars, to-wit, * * * then and there being the property of said banking association, * * * and then and there being in the possession of said Stephen A. Northway, as such president and agent aforesaid, he, the said Stephen A. Northway, then and there * * * wrongfully, unlawfully, and with intent to injure and defraud said banking association, did embezzle and convert to his, said Stephen A. Northway's, own use,' etc. The fifteenth count is for wrongfully, unlawfully, and willfully misapplying certain described funds of the bank, with intent to injure the association, and without the knowledge and consent thereof, by paying and causing to be paid to certain persons, out of the moneys, funds, and credits then and there belonging to the property of the association, a large sum of money, in the purchase by him, the said Northway, for the use, benefit, and advantage of himself, of a large number of shares of the capital stock of certain stock companies. It is not alleged in this count that the moneys and funds so alleged to have been misapplied had previously come into the possession of the defendant by virtue of his office and character of president and agent. In respect to the counts for embezzlement, it is quite clear that the allegation is sufficient, as it distinctly alleges that the moneys and funds charged to have been embezzled were at the time in the possession of the defendant as president and agent. This necessarily means that they had come into his possession in his official character, so that he held them in trust for the use and benefit of the association. In respect to those funds, the charge against him is that he embezzled them by converting them to his own use. This we think fully and exactly describes the offense of embezzlement under the act by an officer or agent of the association. With respect to the fifteenth count, and other similar counts charging a willful misapplication of the funds of the bank, this allegation is omitted; that is, it is not alleged that the moneys and funds charged to have been misapplied had previously come into the possession of the defendant. Neither do we think this to be necessary to a description of the offense. A willful and criminal misapplication of the funds of the association may be made by an officer or agent of the bank without having previously received them into his manual possession. In the case of U. S. v. Britton, Sup. Ct. Rep. the offense of willfully misapplying the funds of a banking association, as defined by the statute, was considered with reference to the facts in that case. It was there held that a willful and criminal misapplication of the funds, as defined by section did not include every case of an unlawful application of funds, inasmuch as in the very statute itself there were other instances of unlawful misapplication evidently not embraced within the intention of section For that reason it was held in that case that it was necessary to specify the particulars of the application, so as to distinguish that charged in the indictment as willful and criminal from those others contemplated by the statute which were unlawful but not criminal; and it was held to be of the essence of the criminality of the misapplication that there should be a conversion of the funds to the use of the defendant, or of some person other than the association, with intent to injure and defraud the association, or some other body corporate or natural person. Now, if in addition it be necessary to the commission of the offense of willfully misapplying the funds of the bank that they should have come previously into the possession of the defendant in his official capacity, so that he could be said to have been intrusted with their possession, all distinction between the offenses of willfully misapplying the funds and of embezzlement would disappear. But it is evidently the intention of the statute not to use the words 'embezzle' and 'willfully misapply' as synonymous. In order to misapply the funds of the bank it is not necessary that the officer charged should be in actual possession of them by virtue of a trust committed to him. He may abstract them from the other funds of the bank unlawfully, and afterwards criminally misapply them, or by virtue of his official relation to the bank he may have such control, direction, and power of management as to direct an application of the funds in such a manner and under such circumstances as to constitute the offense of willful misapplication. And when it is charged, as in the counts of this indictment, that he did willfully misapply certain funds belonging to the association by causing them to be paid out to his own use and benefit in unauthorized and unlawful purchases, without the knowledge and consent of the association, and with the intent to injure it, it necessarily implies that the acts charged were done by him in his official capacity, and by virtue of power, control, and management which he was enabled to exert by virtue of his official relation. This, we think, completes the offense intended by the statute of a willful misapplication of the moneys and funds of a national banking association. We therefore answer the third question in the negative.
7
8
4. The fourth question is whether it is necessary, in charging the defendant with aiding and abetting Sylvester T. Fuller, the cashier of the bank, with the misapplication of its funds, to charge that the defendant then and there knew that said Fuller was such cashier. We answer this question in the negative. The counts in question charge Fuller with having made the misapplication of the funds of the bank as cashier. They further allege that the defendant, being president and agent of the association, willfully, knowingly, and unlawfully, and with intent to injure said banking association, before the misdemeanor was committed, 'did aid, abet, incite, counsel, and procure the said Sylvester T. Fuller, he, the said Fuller, then and there being cashier and agent as aforesaid, so as aforesaid to wrongfully, unlawfully, and willfully misapply,' etc. We do not think it is necessary, in an indictment for this offense, to charge any scienter more distinctly. The acts charged against Fuller could only be committed by him by virtue of his official relation to the bank. The acts charged against the defendant like wise could only be committed by him in his official capacity. Both are alleged to be officers of the same corporation. The knowledge that each had of the official relation of the other is necessarily implied in the co-existence of this official relation on the part of both towards the same corporation. It is as cashier that u ller was aided and abetted by the defendant in the commission of his offense. This allegation necessarily imputes knowledge of his official character.

5. The second count of the indictment is for the offense of abstracting the moneys and funds of the association. In substance, it charges that the defendant was president and agent of the Second National Bank of Jefferson, theretofore duly organized and established, and then existing and doing business, under the laws of the United States; and that the defendant, being president and agent as aforesaid, did then and there 'willfully and unlawfully, and with intent to injure the said national banking association, and without the knowledge and consent thereof, abstract and convert to his, the said Stephen A. Northway's, own use certain moneys and funds of the property of said association, of the amount and value,' etc. We see no reason to doubt the sufficiency of this description of the offense. It is true that the word 'abstract,' as used in this statute, is not a word of settled technical meaning like the word 'embezzle,' as used in statutes defining the offense of embezzlement, and the words 'steal, take, and carry away,' as used to define the offense of larceny at common law. It is a word, however, of simple, popular meaning, without ambiguity. It means to take or withdraw from; so that to abstract the funds of the bank, or a portion of them, is to take and withdraw from the possession and control of the bank the moneys and funds alleged to be so abstracted. This, of course, does not embrace every element of that which, under this section of the statute, is made the offense of criminally abstracting the funds of the bank. To constitute that offense, within the meaning of the act, it is necessary that the moneys and funds should be abstracted from the bank without its knowledge and consent, with the intent to injure or defraud it, or some other company or person, or to deceive some officer of the association, or an agent appointed to examine its affairs. All these elements are contained in the description of the offense in the count in question. The count is therefore sufficient within the decisions of this court upon similar statutes. U. S. v. Mills, U. S. v. Simmons, U. S. v. Carll, U. S. v. Britton, Sup. Ct. Rep. Unlike the word 'misapply,' as used in the same section the word 'abstract' is not ambiguous, because it does not appear from other parts of the statute that there are two or more kinds of abstracting, both unlawful, but only one described as a criminal offense. The word 'abstract,' as used in the statute, therefore, has but one meaning, being that which is attached to it in its ordinary and popular use. It is to be accepted with that meaning in framing an indictment under the section, which is not required, in order to be sufficient, to contain more than those allegations which are necessary, when added to the allegation of abstracting, to complete the description of the offense intended by the statute. This the count in question sufficiently does. It is contended, however, on behalf of the defendant, that the offense of 'abstracting' the moneys and funds of the bank under this section of the statute is exactly equivalent to the offense of larceny, and that it can only be technically and appropriately described by the words used to describe the offense of larceny. So that the charge should have been, 'did abstract, take, and carry away.' The answer to this point, it seems to us, is twofold. If, as is contended, an analysis of the section of the statute demonstrates that the legislative intent was simply to describe the offense of larceny by an officer or agent of the bank of its funds, then there is no ambiguity or uncertainty in using the word 'abstract' in the indictment, as used in the statute, fully to describe the offense charged; for, according to the argument, it can mean nothing else, ad the legislature, by substituting the word 'abstract' for the words which are required technically to describe the offense of larceny, have justified the use of the same word in the indictment. But, in the next place, we do not admit the proposition that the offense of 'abstracting' the funds of the bank under this section is necessarily equivalent to the offense of larceny. The offense of larceny is not complete without the animus furandi, the intent to deprive the owner of his property; but, under section an officer of the bank may be guilty of 'abstracting' the funds and money and credits of the bank without that particular intent. The statute may be satisfied with an intent to injure or defraud some other company, body politic or corporate, or individual person, than the banking association whose property is abstracted, or merely to deceive some other officer of the association, or an agent appointed to examine its affairs. This intent may exist in a case of abstracting without that intent which is necessary to constitute the offense of stealing. We answer the fifth question, therefore, in the affirmative.
9
 The sixth question is whether the indictment sufficiently states that the Second National Bank of Jefferson was organized under the national banking act, or to carry on the business of banking under the laws of the United States. The language of the indictment is that the defendant 'was them and there president and agent of a certain national banking association, to-wit, 'The Second National Bank of Jefferson,' theretofore duly organized and established, and then existing and doing business at the village of Jefferson and county of Ashtabula, in the division and district aforesaid, under the laws of the United States.' We do not understand the necessity of this question. The allegation seems to be perfectly explicit. The defendant is charged by virtue of his office as president and agent of a national banking association, to-wit, the Second National Bank of Jefferson, which, it is further alleged, had been theretofore duly organized and established, and was then existing and doing business, under the laws of the United States. This can mean only that it was organized and established as a banking association under the act of congress authorizing the organization and establishment of national banks, and that it was in existence and doing business at the time of the alleged offense as such national banking association, because it could not be organized and established and existing and doing business under the laws of the United States in any other capacity. This question is accordingly answered in the affirmative. These answers will be accordingly certified to the circuit court.

THE L. P. DAYTON.1
THE JAMES BOWEN.
MCNALLY
v.
THE L. P. DAYTON and others.
February 7, 1887.
1
h the circuit court proceeded is that, as the libel alleges negligence and fault in various particulars as against the tug L. P. Dayton and the tug James Bowen, which are denied in the several answers of the respective claimants, in opposition to which the libelant has proven no negligence or fault on the part of either, the libel must be dismissed, as the burden of proof lies upon the libelant to establish a case of negligence against one or the other or both of the respondents, and that this burden of proof is not changed or shifted by reason of any allegations of fault contained in the answer of either respondent as against the other. On the other hand, it is contended on the part of the libelant that while it is true that each of the defendants denies the negligence charged against it, yet both the answers show that the loss must have been occasioned by the fault of one of the defendants, and that being so, the law casts upon each defendant the burden of making good its allegations of fault against the other in order to exonerate itself. The proposition is stated by one of the counsel for the appellant in his printed argument as follows: 'A vessel, without propelling or steering power, lashed to the side of a tug, is sunk, as the result of a collision between such tug and another one. In a libel filed by the tow against both tugs, to which answers are interposed, in neither of which is negligence causing or contributing to the collision attributed to the tow, and by which each tug seeks to exculpate itself and inculpate the other, a prima facie case of negligence arises without the necessity of proving the specific acts of negligence by either or both tugs, and that the decree to be entered in favor of the libelant, either against one tug alone or against both, is dependent entirely upon the nature of the evidence which it is incumbent upon the tugs to produce in order to determine as between themselves the issues so made by them by their respective answers.' The propriety and soundness of this rule is supposed in argument to rest upon two general grounds: (1) It is contended that the tow which was injured by the collision is in the same category, as respects both tugs, as that of a vessel at anchor injured by a collision with a moving vessel, where the burden of proof is upon the latter to show that it was without fault, or that the disaster was the result of fault on the part of the complaining party. (2) That where it appears, as in the present case, that the tow, being helpless as to its own navigation, was without fault on its part, and it is manifest, from the circumstances appearing on the pleadings, that the collision was caused either by the fault of one or the other of the tugs, or was result of inevitable accident, the burden of proof rests upon each to establish such facts as excuse it. The argument is that such a disaster could only occur from fault of navigation, or from that vis major, which is styled inevitable accident; that by the supposition the appellant is free from fault; that consequently it must be that either there was fault on the other side or inevitable accident, in either of which cases it is incumbent upon the respondent affirmatively to establish its excuse. It is also contended for the appellant that, if the truth of the general rule must be admitted, that he who seeks judicially to establish a claim based upon an alleged default of his adversary must affirmatively establish by proof the facts which justify his complaint, and that the burden of proof, as a principle of general jurisprudence, is assumed by the plaintiff, unless the cause of action i confessed or admitted judicially by the defendant; yet it is also true that, if the defendant accompanies a general denial of the alleged cause of action with the admission of such facts as in law constitute his liability, the plaintiff's case is in fact admitted without other proof; and that, in this aspect, the libelant was entitled to a decree below on the basis of certain admissions of fact in each of the answers inconsistent with the general denials of fault. In our opinion the burden of proof was upon the appellant to establish a case of negligence against each of the tugs separately and independently. The rule which presumes fault in a case of collision against a vessel in motion in favor of one at anchor does not apply. In the present case the tow which was injured was not at rest as respects either of the tugs. As against the Bowen, the movement and navigation of the tow was under the control and management of the Dayton; and, in a suit against the Bowen, the tow can have no other or greater rights, and no other or better standing in court, than would the Dayton have had in case the collision had been directly with her, because the tow in such a suit is identified with its own tug, so far, at least, that she cannot escape the consequences if the collision was caused wholly or in part by the fault of that tug. The Civilta and The Restless, Sturgis v. Boyer, The J. H. Gautier, The Cleadon, Lush. It follows, therefore, that, as respects the Bowen, the same burden of establishing the fault charged against it rests upon the libelant in this case as the law would impose upon the Dayton if she were the libelant prosecuting for damages on its own behalf, as to which there could be no question. As between the tow and its tug, the Dayton, the contract of towage involves a responsibility for loss upon the tug only by reason of the want of ordinary care; for a tug is not a common carrier, and does not insure the safety of its tow. In some cases the facts of the collision, as admitted in the pleadings, might constitute a prima facie case of negligence, which would impose upon the tug the duty of explanation and exoneration; but no such presumption of fault arises in the present case. Here there was a collision between the tow of one tug and the tow of another, which may have been caused by a fault of navigation upon the part of one or both of the tugs. Each charges fault against the other. As the matter stands, it is indeterminate, being a mere matter of controversy to be adjudged between them upon proof of all the circumstances. In favor of the injured tow, the libelant in this case, there is no presumption of fault as against either, nor against both jointly. There is no presumption against the Bowen, for the reason we have already stated. There is none against the Dayton, because, on her behalf, all the alleged negligence is denied, and the contrary allegations of the libel cannot be legally maintained merely by corresponding allegations in the answer of the Bowen. To hold otherwise would require that in every case, as between the tow and its tug, the latter should be required affirmatively to establish its defense against the presumption of its negligence. There is no ground in reason or authority for making such an exception to the general rule, which requires the plaintiff, in the first instance, to establish by proof the allegations of its complaint. It does not tend to establish such an exception that it appears by the record that one or the other of the respondents must have been so in fault as to be liable for the consequences. It still remains that there is a controversy as to which of the two is guilty, and no decree can pass without affirming the liability of one or both. That affirmation must stand upon proof, unless it appears on the record which one of the two is at fault, or that both are. Neither is it material that the facts of the case, and the causes of the collision, are peculiarly within the knol edge of the respondents. It is alleged in the present case, as one of the inconveniences of the libelant's situation, that it would be compelled, in order to establish the allegations of the libel, to resort to the testimony of those navigating the respective tugs, and thus call witnesses interested to exonerate the vessel to which they were attached. We are not aware, however, of any ground on which such an inconvenience can affect the rule of law which governs the rights of the parties. And, perhaps, it is counterbalanced by the corresponding interest on the part of each set of witnesses to fix the fault upon the opposing vessel.

2
It is further argued on the part of the appellant that it was entitled to a decree below, as against the Bowen, on the ground of admissions, in the answer filed on its behalf, affirmatively showing negligence and a violation of the rules of navigation tending to produce a collision. This aspect of the case was disposed of by the circuit court in the opinion of Mr. Justice BLATCHFORD, which we adopt, as follows: 'It is urged for the libelants that the answer of the Bowen shows that she had the Dayton on her starboard side, with the courses of the two vessels crossing so as to involve risk of collision, and that, therefore, under rule 19 of section of the Revised Statutes, it was the duty of the Bowen to keep out of the way of the Dayton, and, as she did not, a prima facie case of negligence is thus made out against her by her answer. This is an error. The facts stated in the answer of the Bowen do not show that the courses of the two tugs were crossing when the Bowen discovered the Dayton. On the contrary the green light of the Dayton was then visible to the Bowen, and not her red light, and the Dayton appeared to be going between the Bowen and the New York shore, to the eastward, and in a direction which would cause her green light to still be visible to the Bowen, and her red light to be still invisible. This would insure safety and no collision; and, to insure it still more, the Bowen blew two whistles, and the Dayton answered with two whistles. After that the Bowen starboarded. Even if, before so starboarding, and while so starboarding, the Bowen is to be considered as having the Dayton on her starboard side, with the courses of the two vessels crossing, (which is by no means clear on the averments in the answer of the Bowen,) her answer shows that she took proper measures to keep out of the way of the Dayton; that such measures were assented to at the time by the Dayton as proper, and that then the Dayton changed her course and went across the bow of the Bowen. Under these circumstances the Bowen slowed, stopped, and backed. The answer of the Bowen states substantially that there was imminent danger of collision if she kept on. There is nothing in all this to show negligence in the Bowen. When the Dayton so came suddenly across the bow of the Bowen, a case was not made within rule 19, although in that position the Bowen had the Dayton on her starboard side, and their courses were crossing; and even if it were, the answer shows that the Bowen did all she could to keep out of the way of the Dayton. The libel, so far from alleging that it was a fault in the Bowen to slow, stop, and back, alleges, as a fault in her, that she did not reverse, or did not do so soon enough. The isolated fact of her showing, stopping, and backing cannot be taken away from the connection in which it is found in the answer and separated from the circumstances under which the answer states it occurred, particularly as the libel states distinctly that it was a fault in her not to reverse.'

120 U.S. 363
HARMON
v.
MCADAMS.
February 7, 1887.
1
This was an action of assumpsit brought in the circuit court of the United States for the Northern district of Illinois, on September 25, 1885, the plaintiffs being executors of Jacob Harmon, deceased, citizens of Indiana, and the defendants citizens of Illinois. The action was founded on a promissory note signed by the defendants, dated March 1, 1875, payable one year after date to the order of Jacob Harmon, for $ with interest at 10 per cent. per annum from date until paid, with a proviso that, if the note was collected by suit, the judgment should include a reasonable fee for the plaintiffs' attorney. A copy of the note, with the indorsements thereon, was set out with the declaration, showing that the interest thereon had been paid to March 1, 1885. The plea was the general issue. The case was tried by a jury, who returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs below, the judgment on which is brought into review by this writ of error. From the bill of exceptions it appears that the following took place on the trial: 'Upon the said trial the defendants introduced proof tending to show that there was a verbal agreement between themselves and Jacob Harmon, the payee of the note, that if they would pay the interest regularly, at the rate of ten per cent. per annum, as called for by the note, until his death, they should be acquitted of the payment of the principal; in other words, that the money represented by the note was given to them upon condition that they should pay the interest thereon during the life of Jacob Harmon at the rate of ten per cent. per annum. The defendants also offered to prove that in the forepart of the year after the said note in suit had become due, they offered to pay Jacob Harmon the amount then due on said note, with interest, and proposed to do so, unless he would reduce the interest; whereupon the said Jacob Harmon verbally agreed that, if they would continue to pay him the interest upon the sum of money represented by said note during his life, and pay in November of each year the interest in advance for four months, or, if they failed to pay the interest in advance for four months, should pay interest upon the interest so unpaid, then the said defendants should be acquitted of and released from the payment of the principal sum of said note at the death of said Jacob Harmon; which the court refused to be permitted to be proved, and the defendants then and there excepted. And the court, being of opinion that the facts so offered in evidence by the defendants, and the said facts which the defendants offered to prove, would not make a sufficin t defense at law, if proven in the said case, directed the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiff therein, and the verdict was taken accordingly; to all of which the defendants then and there duly excepted.' These rulings of the court are now assigned for error. In support of the assignments of error the plaintiffs in error maintain this proposition, viz.: That an agreement by the payor, after the note becomes due, to keep the money and pay interest thereon at the rate of 10 per cent. per annum till the death of the payee, constitutes a sufficient consideration for an agreement on the part of the payee that he will then consider the note canceled and paid, where the payor from the time of such agreement continues to pay such interest on the note until the death of the payee. This proposition should be considered in connection with the fact that in the year and therefore after the note in suit had become due, the interest laws of Illinois were so changed as to make 8 per cent. per annum the maximum rate of interest that could be thereafter contracted for. Hurd, Gen. St.

The agreement proved, and that to prove which evidence was offered, were both unilateral. The promise alleged was by the payee of the note, not in consideration of a promise on the part of the payor, but on condition that he perform what was to be done, viz., payment of the interest at the rate and in the mode agreed until the death of the payee. It became essential, therefore, to the defense, to establish the fact that this undertaking had been fully performed, by proof of the payment of the interest as agreed until the death of Jacob Harmon. This fact is assumed in the brief of the counsel for the plaintiffs in error, but it nowhere appears in the record. The bill of exceptions does not state when jacob Harmon died. It does not appear elsewhere in the record. All we can know from that is that he must have died before the institution of the suit, which was begun by his executors on September 25, 1885, but whether before or after March 1, 1885, we cannot infer, that being the date up to which interest was paid. If he died after that date, then the condition on which his promise could be enforced against his executors had not been fulfilled. On this point, therefore, the defense failed. Judgment affirmed.

120 U.S. 366
DURAND and another
v.
MARTIN.
February 7, 1887.
1
This was a suit brought by Samuel B. Martin, the defendant in error, on the twentieth of March, 1878, in the district court of Contra Costa county, California, against Martin Durand and Anthony Thompson, the plaintiffs in error, to recover the possession of the E. 1/2 section 13, township 2 S., range 1 E., Mount Diablo meridian. The facts found at the trial were, in brief, these:
1
2
The land in dispute was agricultural land, and it was located by the locating agent of California on the twentieth of October, 1862, at the request and in the name of Martin, in lieu of the E. 1/2 section 16, township 22S., range 6 E. of the same meridian. In making this selection, which was for indemnity school lands, the agent acted under color of the authority of section 7 of the act of March ) This township 22 has never been surveyed by the United States, and the E. 1/2 of section 16 is within the boundaries of a Mexican grant known as 'San Miguelito,' confirmed to one Gonzales, the final survey of which was approved in 1859, and the lands afterwards patented to Gonzales or his assigns.
2
3
On the second of March, 1863, the state of California issued a certificate of purchase to Martin for the land in dispute. On the eighth of September, 1870, it was listed to the state by the United States government, and, on the third of February, 1871, it was patented by the state to Martin under his certificate of purchase. The plat of the United States survey of township 2, embracing the land, was filed in the United States land-office in San Francisco on the tenth of June, 1865.
3
4
On the tenth of April, 1839, the Mexican government granted to Jose Noriega and Robert Livermore a tract of land known as 'Las Pocitas.' The claim under this grant was confirmed on the fourteenth of February, 1854, by the land commissioners appointed under the act of Mac h ) and afterwards, on appeal, by this court, at December term, After the decision of the land commissioners, a deputy surveyor, under instructions from the surveyor general of the United States for California, made a survey which purported to show the boundaries of the claim confirmed, and this survey was approved by the surveyor general, May 7, 1854, but nothing further appears to have been done under it. In March, 1869, after the decree of confirmation by this court, the surveyor general caused the claim so confirmed to be again surveyed and designated; and this survey was approved by him May 11, 1870, by the commissioner of the United States general land-office, March 1, 1871, and by the secretary of the interior, June 6, 1871. On the twentieth of August, 1872, the United States issued a patent to Noriega and Livermore, their heirs and assigns, for the land so surveyed and designated in March, 1869. The land now in dispute was embraced within the exterior boundaries of the grant adjudged to be valid by the decree of the board of land commissioners affirmed by this court, but was not embraced within the surveys of or in the patent issued to Noriega and Livermore.

On the sixteenth of May, 1876, Thompson entered into the possession of the south half and Durand into the possession of the north half of the half section in dispute. When these entries were made, Martin was in possession of the land, though it was not then, nor had it ever been, fully inclosed or fenced. Within a few days afterwards, Martin notified Thompson that he claimed to own the land under a patent from the state of California, which he exhibited; but, notwithstanding this, both Thompson and Durand maintained actual and exclusive possession, and kept Martin out, until this suit was brought. Each of the parties entered for the purpose of availing himself of the pre-emption laws of the United States, having the necessary personal qualifications therefor. They each made application at the proper land-office to perfect their respective claims, but the officers refused to permit them to do so. Upon this state of facts the supreme court of California affirmed a judgment of the district court in favor of Martin, and to reverse that decision this writ of error was brought.
5
6
Upon the facts as found we have no hesitation in deciding that the title of Martin, under his patent from the state of California, was pertect when his suit was brought, and that the judgment in his favor was right. The land in dispute had not only been selected by the state as indemnity school lands, and certified or listed as such by the proper officer of the United States, when Durand and Thompson made their respective entries as pre-emption settlers, but it had been patented to Martin, and he was in actual possession under color of that title. These are facts specially found by the court below, and the evidence on which this finding was made cannot be considered here. Such being the case, the land was not open to pre-emption settlement as against Martin when Durand and Thompson entered on his possession. Atherton v. Fowler, Trenouth v. San Francisco, Mower v. Fletcher, Sup. Ct. Rep. 
6
7
If the title of Martin was ever at all defective, it was because, at the time of the selection, the land was within the boundaries of a claim under a Mexican grant, and therefore not then, in a strict legal sense, public land; but the United States have never objected to the title of the state because of this. On the contrary, after a survey had been made and approved by the surveyor general of the United States for California which excluded the land from the grant, the proper officer of the United States listed it to the state under the act of August ) now section of the Revised Statutes, as indemnity school lands which had been properly selected; and from that day to this, so far as the records hows, the United States have never disputed the title of the state or its grantee. This survey was made in 1869; the claim having been finally confirmed in 1860. As the survey was not made until more than 10 months after the act of July ) 'to quiet land titles in California,' had become operative, its approval by the surveyor general had the effect, under the ruling of this court in Frasher v. O'Connor, Sup. Ct. Rep. of opening all lands within the exterior boundaries of the grant, but outside of those fixed by the survey, to selection or pre-emption entry as public lands, subject only to a defeat of title if in the end the survey as made should be set aside, and the boundaries of the grant finally extended so as to include the selection or the entry. In the present case, however, the survey was accepted by the owners of the grant, and a patent taken for the land within its boundaries, in full satisfaction of their original claim as confirmed by the commissioners and by this court. This was in 1872, and from that time certainly there has been no one, according to this record, who could dispute the title of the state or its grantee except the United States. The owners of the Mexican grant abandoned their claim to the excluded land when they accepted their patent, and no one could enter upon the land by the laws of the United States as a pre-emption settler, because Martin was in the actual possession under his claim of title. It is not contended that this title of Martin is even technically defective, unless it be for the reason that the selection was actually made when the land was not in law public land. But when the commissioner of the general land-office, in 1870, certified this with other land to the state as land which had been selected as indemnity lands, it was an existing selection at that date, and there were no intervening rights to prevent its operation as such. By accepting the certificate the state treated the selection as a valid selection existing at the time of the certificate; and the list thus certified operated, under the act of as a transfer of the title from the United States to the state, which immediately inured to the benefit of Martin under his patent. It is true that the certificate of the commissioner to a list of lands which were not open to selection at the time they were selected, nor at the time they were certified, would not pass title out of the United States, be cause he had no authority in law to make such a certificate. But the case is quite different when the state presents for certification as an existing selection one that was bad whem made, but good when presented. Under such circumstances, if the rights of no third parties have intervened, there is nothing to prevent the commissioner from treating the selection as if made on the date of its presentation, and certifying accordingly. His certificate is of selections claimed by the state at the time of its date; and, if the state had a right to the title under the circumstances existing then, it was within his official authority to make the transfer. It is a matter of no moment that the selection was bad at the time it was made, if at the time of its presentation for title it was good, and there were no intervening rights to be injured by reason of its acceptance and ratification by the United States.

8
This would be sufficient to sustain the title of Martin if there were nothing more. But there is more. All must agree that, even if the title was defective because of the invalidity of the original selection, it was within the power of the United States to cure such a defect by a release to the state or its grantee of all their interest in the land remaining after the lists were certified by the commissioner of the land-office, provided no other person had in the mean time acquired rights superior to those of Martin. This, we think, was done by the act of March ) 'relating to indemnity school e lections in the state of California.' That act is as follows:
8
9
'Be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the United States of America in congress assembled, that the title to the lands certified to the state of California known as 'Indemnity School Selections,' which lands were selected in lieu of sixteenth and thirty-sixth sections lying within Mexican grants, of which grants the final survey had not been made at the date of such selections by said state, is hereby confirmed to said state in lieu of the sixteenth and thirty-sixth sections, for which the selections were made.
9
10
'Sec. 2. That where indemnity school selections have been made and certified to said state, and said selections shall fail, by reason of the land in lieu of which they were taken not being included within such final survey of a Mexican grant, or are otherwise defective or invalid, the same are hereby confirmed, and the sixteenth or thirty-sixth section, in lieu of which the selection was made, shall, upon being excluded from such final survey, be disposed of as other public lands of the United States: Provided, that if there be no such sixteenth or thirty-sixth section, and the land certified therefor shall be held by an innocent purchaser for a valuable consideration, such purchaser shall be allowed to prove such facts before the proper land-office, and shall be allowed to purchase the same at one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre, not to exceed three hundred ant twenty acres for any one person: provided, that if such person shall neglect or refuse, after knowledge of such facts, to furnish such proof and make payment for such land, it shall be subject to the general land laws of the United States.
10
11
'Sec. 3. That the foregoing confirmation shall not extend to the lands settled upon by any actual settler claiming the right to enter, not exceeding the prescribed legal quantity under the homestead or pre-emption laws: provided, that such settlement was made in good faith upon lands not occupied by the settlement or improvement of any other person, and prior to the date of certification of said lands, to the state of California by the department of the interior: and provided, further, that the claim of such settler shall be presented to the register and receiver of the district land-office, together with the proper proof of his settlement and residence, within twelve months after the passage of this act, under such rules and regulations as may be established by the commissioner of the general land-office.
11
12
'Sec. 4. That this act shall not apply to any mineral lands, nor to any lands in the city and county of San Francisco, nor to any incorporated city or town, nor to any tide, swamp, or overflowed lands.'
12
13
This statute was, in our opinion, a full and complete ratification by congress, according to its terms, of the lists of indemnity school selections which had been before that time certified to the state of California by the United States as indemnity school selections, no matter how defective or insufficient such certificates might originally have been, if the lands included in the lists were not of the character of any of those mentioned in section 4, and if they had not been taken up in good faith by a homestead or pre-emption settler prior to the date of the certificate. The history of the times, which is exemplified by the facts of this case, shows that such must have been the intention of congress. Almost from the beginning many of the titles under these indemnity selections had been in doubt because of the delay which attended the settlement of Mexican claims; and the records of this court contain a large number of cases in which claimants under the pre-emption and homestead laws of the United States have sought to establish their titles, as against purchasers from the state under indemnity selections who had been many years in possession, because of some real or supposed defect in the title of the state. This statute was passed 23 years after the original grant to the stt e of the right to select indemnity lands for lost school sections, and more than 14 years after the lands now in dispute had been selected by the state under this grant and sold to Martin. Eight years before the statute the proper officer of the United States had made a certificate which, if authorized by law, transferred an absolute estate in fee-simple to the state that inured at once to the benefit of Martin. This certificate had never been disputed by the United States, and no attempt had ever been made by any one in authority to set it aside. This, as we know from our own records, is but one of many cases of a similar character; and, read in the light of these facts, the statute has to us no uncertain meaning.
13
14
In its first section all such certificates are expressly confirmed where the only objection to their validity is that a selection was made before the Mexican grant within which the original school section was actually situated had been surveyed, and the survey finally approved. In this class of cases the state was entitled to its indemnity lands, and the United States in effect formally waived any and all irregularities in making the selections.
14
15
In the second section cases were provided for in which the selection failed (1) because the school section in lieu of which indemnity was claimed and taken was not actually within the limits of a Mexican grant; and (2) because it was 'otherwise defective or invalid.' This language is certainly broad enough to include every defective certificate; and, in order that the United States might be protected from loss, it was provided that if the sixteenth or thirty-sixth section, in lieu of which the selection was made, should be found outside the Mexican grant, the United States would accept that in lieu of the selected land, and confirm the selection. If, however, there was no such sixteenth or thirty-sixth section, and the land certified was held by an innocent purchaser from the state for a valuable consideration, such purchaser would be allowed to purchase the same from the United States at the rate of $per acre, not exceeding acres for any one person.
15
16
The statute relates only to such selections as had been certified to the state, and, taken as a whole, it meets the requirements of all the cases of defective selection which could be so certified. These These are: (1) Cases where the state was entitled to indemnity, but the selection was defective in form; (2) cases where the original school sections were actually in place, and the state was not entitled to indemnity on their account; and (3) cases where the state was not entitled to indemnity because there never had been such a section 16 or section 36 as was represented when the selection was made and the official certificate given. As to the first of these classes, the certificate was simply confirmed because the state was entitled to its indemnity, and nothing was needed to perfect the title but a waiver by the United States of all irregularities in the time and manner of the selections. As to the second, the selection was confirmed, and the United States took in lieu of the selected land that which the state would have been entitled to but for the indemnity it had claimed and got. In its effect this was an exchange of lands between the United States and the state. And as to the third, in lieu of confirmation,bona fide purchasers from the state were given the privilege of perfecting their titles by paying the United States for the land at a specified price. Under these circumstances, it was a matter of no moment to the United States whether the original selection was invalid for one cause or another. If the state was actually entitled to indemnity, it was got, and the United States only gave what it had agreed to give. If the state claimed and got indemnity when it ought to have taken the original school sections, the United States took the school sections and relinquished thier rights to the lands which had been selected in lieu. And if the stat had claimed and sold land to which it had no right, and for which it could not give school land in return, an equitable provision was made for the protection of the purchaser by which he could keep the land, and the United States would get its value in money. In this way all defective titles, under the government certificates, would be made good without loss to the United States.
16
17
It may be, as was claimed in argument, that, when the bill was originally prepared, the framer had it in mind only to provide for selections made in lieu of school sections within Mexican grants before the final survey of the grants, and for selections made in lieu of sections not finally included within the survey of a grant, but to our minds it is clear that before the bill finally became a law congress saw that, as ample provision had been made for the protection of the United States in all cases, it was best to include all certificates which were defective, no matter for what cause, and so the words 'or are otherwise defective or invalid' were added in what seemed to be the most appropriate place to carry that purpose into effect. No selection was made good unless it had been certified, and not then unless the United States got an equivalent either in land or in money, or in carrying out their original school land grant. In this way the titles of all bona fide purchasers from the state were or could be perfected without loss to the United States, and that, we have no doubt, was the intention of congress when the statute was enacted.
17
18
It is true that Durand and Thompson had entered on the land, and had excluded Martin from the possession, before the statute was passed, but that gave them no rights, either under this statute or any other. As we have already shown, their entry was of no avail under the general pre-emption laws, and this statute saves the rights of no homestead or pre-emption settlers except such as had entered on the lands in good faith prior to the date of their certification to the state.

The judgment is affirmed.

MARTIN
v.
THOMPSON.
February 7, 1887.
1
This suit was brought by Martin, the defendant in error in durand v. Martin, infra, just decided, to recover of Thompson, one of the plaintiffs in error, a crop of wheat raised by him during the year on the land described in that case, which he took from the possession of Martin in 1876, and occupied adversely thereafter. The court has found as a fact that Martin never had possession of the crop before the commencement of this suit, and that it was raised by Thompson with his own labor and at his own expense, while he held exclusive possession of the land adversely to Martin and claiming title. From this it is clear that the question of the title to the land was not necessarily involved in this case; and, on looking into the opinion, which in California forms part of the record, we find that the decision was put entirely on the ground that the owner of land out of possession cannot recover from one in possession holding adversely under claim of title the crops raised by him in cultivating the soil. The remedy in such a case is by an appropriae action for the recovery of the possession of the land and damages for the detention. This does not present a federal question, and the motion to dismiss is granted.

SPEIDEL and another, Executors, etc.,
v.
HENRICI and another, Trustees, etc.1
March 7, 1887.
1
This bill was filed against the trustees of the Harmony Society, an unincorporated association of persons living together as a community, by a former member of the society, claiming a share in property in the hands of the trustees. The bill is sought to be maintained on the ground that the trust was not a charity, in the legal sense, and the members of the society were equitable tenants in common of the property held in trust. The learned counsel for the appellants differ in their views of the trust; the one insisting that it was unlawful, because founded in fraud and against public policy, and should therefore be dissolved; and the other contending that it was a lawful and continuing trust. We have not found it necessary to consider which of these is the sound view, because we are of opinion that the plaintiff did not show himself to be entitled to invoke the interposition of a court of equity.
1
2
As a general rule, doubtless, length of time is no bar to a trust clearly established, and express trusts are not within the statute of limitations, because the possession of the trustee is presumed to be the possession of his cestui que trust. Prevost v. Gratz, Lewis v. Hawkins, Railroad Co. v. Durant, But this rule is, in accordance with the reason on which it is founded, and as has been clearly pointed out by Chancellor KENT and Mr. Justice STORY, subject to this qualification: that time begins to run against a trust as soon as it is openly disavowed by the trustee insisting upon an adverse right and interest which is clearly and unequivocally made known to the cestui que trust; as when, for instance, such transactions take place between the trustee and the cestui que trust as would, in case of tenants in common, amount to an ouster of one of them by the other. Kane v. Bloodgood, Johns. Ch. 90, 124; Robinson v. Hook, Baker v. Whiting, Oliver v. Piatt, This qualification has been often recognized in the opinions of this court, and distinctly affirmed by its latest judgment upon the subject. Willison v. Watsins, Boone v. Chiles, Seymour v. Freer, Bacon v. Rives, Sup. Ct. Rep. 3; Philippi v. Philippe, Sup. Ct. Rep. In the case of an implied or constructive trust, unless there has been a fraudulent concealment of the cause of action, lapse of time is as complete a bar in equity as at law. Hovenden v. Annesley, 2 Schoales & L. Beckford v. Wade, 1Ves. 87. In such a case, Chief Justice MARSHALL repeated and approved the statement of Sir THOMAS PLUMER, M. R., in a most important case in which his decision was affirmed by the house of lords, that, 'both on principle and authority, the laches and non-claim of the rightful owner of an equitable estate, for a period of 20 years, (supposing it the case of one who must within that period have made his claim in a court of law, had it been a legal § tate,) under no disability, and where there has been no fraud, will constitute a bar to equitable relief, by analogy to the statute of limitations, if, during all that period, the possession has been under a claim unequivocally adverse, and without anything having been done or said, directly or indirectly, to recognize the title of such rightful owner by the adverse possessor.' Elmendorf v. Taylor, Cholmondeley v. Clinton, and 4 Bligh, 1. Independently of any statute of limitations, courts of equity uniformly decline to assist a person who has slept upon his rights, and shows no excuse for his laches in asserting them. 'A court of equity,' said Lord CAMDEN, 'has always refused its aid to stale demands, where the party slept upon his rights, and acquiesced for a great length of time. Nothing can call forth this court into activity but conscience, good faith, and reasonable diligence; where these are wanting, the court is passive, and does nothing. Laches and neglect are always discountenanced, and therefore, from the beginning of this jurisdiction, there was always a limitation to suits in this court.' Smith v. Clay, Brown, Ch. note. This doctrine has been repeatedly recognized and acted on here. Piatt v. Vattier, McKnight v. Taylor, Bowman v. Wathen, Wagner v. Baird, How. Badger v. Badger, 2 Wall. 87; Hume v. Beale, Marsh v. Whitmore, Sullivan v. Portland & K. R. R., Godden v. Kimmell, In Hume v. Beale, the court, in dismissing, because of unexplained delay in suing, a bill by cestuis que trust against a trustee under a deed, observed that it was not important to determine whether he was the trustee of a mere dry legal estate, or whether his duties and responsibilities extended further. See, also, Bright v. Legerton, 29 Beav. 60, and When the bill shows upon its face that the plaintiff, by reason of lapse of time and of his own laches, is not entitled to relief, the objection may be taken by demurrer. Maxwell v. Kennedy, National Bank v. Carpenter, Lansdale v. Smith, Sup. Ct. Rep.

3
The allegations of this bill, so far as they are material to the defense of laches, are in substance as follows: The Harmony Society is a voluntary association, formed in 1805 by the plaintiff's parents and other heads of families, who had emigrated from Germany under the leadership of one Rapp, and become subject to his control in both spiritual and temporal affairs. In that year, Rapp, for the purpose of acquiring absolute dominion over their means and mode of living, falsely and fraudulently represented to them that they could not be saved from eternal damnation except by renouncing the plan of a separate home for each family, yielding up all their possessions, as had been done by the early Christians, and laying them at the feet of Rapp as their apostle, to be put into a common fund of the society, and thenceforth living as a community under his control, receiving in return only the necessaries of life; and they, induced by and relying on his false and fraudulent representations, immediately yielded up all their possessions to the common fund of the society, and placed the fund in his keeping as their trustee, and thenceforth lived as a community or common household, submitted themselves and their families to do for the community such work as he directed, allowed the avails thereof to form part of the common fund, and relinquished to him and his successors in the leadership of the community the management of the trust fund and the control of their own persons and those of their wives and children, and received only the necessaries of life in return. Rapp received and accepted the trust fund, and all the accretions to it by the work of the inhabitants of the community or otherwise, not as his own, but in trust for the members of those families and the contributors to the fund, and for their common benefit; and always, up to his death in 1847, recognized and acknowledged said trust, and disclaimed any greater interest in the fund than that of any other contributor, and any other right to its management and control than by virtue of his leadership of the community. In Rapp obliged his followers to abjure matrimony, and thenceforth did not permit them to marry in the community, and compelled any one about to marry to leave it. The plaintiff was born in the community in 1807, and was reared in and as a part of it, under Rapp's teachings and control, and faithfully worked for it from the age of 12 to the age of 24 years, and allowed the avails of his work to become part of the common fund, and received in return nothing but the necessaries of life, which were of far less value than the avails of his work; and in 1831, being about to marry, had to leave and did leave the community. The trust fund so received and accepted by Rapp, with its profits, interest, and accretions, now amounts to $ and yields an annual income of $ and is held by the defendants on the same trust on which Rapp held it in his life-time; and neither Rapp nor the defendants ever rendered any account to the plaintiff or to the beneficiaries of the fund, although the plaintiff, before bringing this suit in May, 1882, demanded of the defendants an account and a settlement of his share. The trust on which Rapp, and the defendants as his successors, held the common fund of the Harmony Society, is described in one place in the bill as 'for the members of said families and the contributors of said fund, and for their common benefit;' that is to say, as is clearly explained by what goes before, in trust for their common benefit as a community, living together in the community, working for the community, subject to the regulations of the community, and supported by the community. This was the 'said trust,' which, as the bill afterwards alleges, Rapp, up to his death, and his successors, until the bringing of this suit, 'always recognized and acknowledged.' The constant avowal of the trustees that they held the trust fund upon such a trust is wholly inconsistent with and adverse to the claim of the plaintiff that they held the fund in trust for the benefit of the same persons as individuals, though withdrawn from the community, living by themselves, and taking no part in its work. The plaintiff, upon his own showing, withdrew from the community in 1831, and never returned to it, and, for more than 50 years, took no step to demand an account of the trustees, or to follow up the rights which he claimed in this bill. If he ever had any rights, he could not assert them after such a delay, —not on the ground of an express and lawful trust, because the express trust stated in the bill, and constantly avowed by the trustees during this long period, was wholly inconsistent with any trust which would sustain his claim; not on the ground that the express trust stated in the bill was unlawful and void, and therefore the trustees held the trust fund for the benefit of all the contributors in proportion to the amounts of their contributions, because that would be an implied or resulting trust, and barred by lapse of time. In any aspect of the case, therefore, if it was not strictly within the statute of limitations, yet the plaintiff showed so little vigilance and so great laches, that the circuit court rightly held that he was not entitled to relief in equity.

It is proper to add that this decision does not rest in any degree upon the judgments of the supreme court of Pennsylvania and of this court, in the cases cited at the bar, in favor of the trustees of the Harmony Society in suits brought against them by other members, because each of those cases differed in its facts, and especially in showing that the society had written articles f association, which are not disclosed by this bill.

CRITTENDEN, Governer, etc., and others
v.
ROLSTON and others, Trustees, etc.1
March 7, 1887.
1
This was a suit in equity, brought by Rosewell G. Rolston, Heman Dowd, and Oren Root, Jr., trustees in a mortgage made by the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad Company, a Missouri corporation, to restrain the executive officers of Missouri from selling the mortgaged property under prior statutory mortgages in favor of the state, on the ground that the liability for which the earlier liens were created had been satisfied, and that they, as trustees, were entitled to an assignment of those liens. The material facts are these: The Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad Company was incorporated by the state of Missouri, under a statute for that purpose, approved February 16, 1847, to build and operate a railroad from Hannibal, on the Mississippi river, to St. Joseph, on the Missouri. To expedite the construction of the road, the state passed an act, which was approved February 22, 1851, to issue to the company its own bonds as a loan of credit, redeemable at the pleasure of the legislature at any time after the expiration of 20 years from the date of their issue, with interest, payable semi-annually, at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, in the city of New York, on the first days of January and July in each and every year. The acceptance of these bonds by the company was to operate as a mortgage on its road 'for securing the payment of the principal and interest of the sums of money for which such bonds shall * * * be issued and accepted, * * *' The company also became bound to 'make provision for punctual redemption of the said bonds so issued * * * to them, * * * and for the punctual payment of the interest which shall accrue thereon in such manner as to exonerate the treasury of' the 'state from any advances of money for that purpose.' If default should be made by the company in the payment of either the principal or the interest, the governor was authorized to sell the road at auction, first giving a required notice. Under the authority of this statute bonds were issued by the state to the company at different times between December 28, 1853, and September 24, 1856, to the amount of $ for which the company and its railroad became bound in the manner specified. On the tenth of December, 1855, the company, not having then completed its road, another act was passed by the generala ssembly, authorizing a further loan of the credit of the state, in bonds, to the amount of $ These were to be 30-years bonds. Section 2 of this act was as follows:

'Section 2. The loan of the state's credit under this act shall be, and it is hereby declared to be, upon the condition of a first lien or mortgage, as contained and reserved in the act of February 22, 1851, hereinbefore recited, and the same shall in all respects be held to be an extention of the loan of state credit, under the said mortgage provisions, securing the state in this as in the former loan, upon the same equal and unrestricted basis, as to each and every bond of the state so issued, under said acts or either of them.'

'Section 1. The Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad Company is hereby authorized to issue its bonds, signed by the president and countersigned by the secretary of the company, in sums of one thousand dollars each, with coupons attached, bearing interest, payable semi-annually, at the rate of six per cent. per annum, and having not less than ten years to run, and to the amount of three millions of dollars, the payment of the same, with the accruing interest, to be secured by a mortgage or deed of trust conveying to three trustees, to be named therein, by and with appropriate forms of expression, and for the purpose of securing the payment of said bonds and interest, and for no other purpose, on the road of said company, with all its franchises, rolling stock, and appurtenances, subject, however, to all the liens and liabilities existing in favor of the state by virtue of any law of the state at the time said bonds may be issued and delivered.

'Sec. 4. The trueintent and meaning of this act is to place the persons and parties who may hold the bonds of the road authorized to be issued by the first section of this act, through the trustees herein provided, in the same legal position which the people of the state of Missouri now hold, with full powers to act in the premises as the said state, by its governor, might have done; and it shall be the duty of such trustees to proceed to advertise and sell the road, with its appurtenances, as aforesaid, and in the manner provided for the sale of the same by the governor of the state in the acts of the legislature aforesaid, whenever they shall receive a request so to do in writing, signed by persons and parties representing not less than one-third of the bonds authorized to be issued by the first section of this act, and which may be still outstanding, but only in case the said railroad company shall have made default in the payment of the principal or interest on said bonds when the same has become due; and all needed authority to do the same shall be maintained, and all needed decrees shall be issued, by and in any court of competent jurisdiction in this state, either in law or equity, and such sale, so made as herein provided, shall be deemed and held in all respects good and valid in law.

'Sec. 6. This act to take effect from and after its passage.'

When this act was passed, it is said, in the brief of the attorney general, 'the bonds of the state were worth in the market from 65 to 69 cents on the dollar, and there were outstanding on January 1, 1865, state aid bonds loaned to different railroad companies to the amount of many millions of dollars, besides $of other state bonds, and over $of past due coupons on state aid bonds loaned to the railroads.' The testimony shows conclusively that no interest had been paid on any of the aid bonds except those of this company since January 1, 1861. On the twenty-first of March, 1874, an act of the general assembly of Missouri, 'to authorize the issue of new state bonds in renewal of certain other bonds heretofore issued to the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad Company, and to maintain and perpetuate the first lien of the state to secure the payment thereof,' was approved. Down to this time the company had not availed itself of the privileges of the act of February 20, 1865; but it had promptly met and provided for, at maturity, the interest on all its state bonds. By this new act, it was provided that, whenever the owner or owners of any of the bonds issued to the company under the authority of the act of February 22, 1851, 'shall present such bond or bonds for cenewal to the treasurer of the state, and shall satisfy such treasurer that he or they are the real and bona fide holders and owners of such bond or bonds, and that the sae have not been paid by the state, or by the said company, and that they have not been taken up and placed in the hands of the trustees to secure the payment of other bonds issued by said company, as authorized by the act entitled 'An act to provide for reducing the indebtedness of the state,' approved February 20, 1865, the treasurer shall certify the facts to the governor of the state, and the governor shall thereupon cause to be issued in renewal of such old bonds, and deliver to the holder or holders thereof, new bonds of the state of Missouri, in lieu thereof, said bonds to be signed by the governor, and counter-signed by the secretary of state, sealed with the seal of the state, and registered in the office of the state auditor, and they shall be of the same denomination and tenor of the old bonds for which they are to be exchanged; and they shall have the same rate of interest, with like coupons, and be payable in the same time and manner, as said old bonds.' Ample provision was then made for the preservation of the original security, and the company was made liable for the payment of the renewal bonds to the same extent and in the same way it had been for the originals. The company formally accepted the provisions of this act, and under it renewal bonds were issued to the amount of $ one of the original bonds for $having been paid. These renewal bonds mature as follows:

The company having at all times met the interest on these bonds as it matured, as well as that on the bonds issued under the act of the board of directors, on the nineteenth of January, 1881, adopted a plan for refunding its debt, which contemplated a discharge of its obligations to the state in the way provided for in the act of February 20, 1865. A few days previous to this time the officers of the state had been informally approached on the subject; but on that day negotiations were regularly opened by the following letter from the president of the company to the governor of the state:

21
'Hon. Thos. T. Crittenden, Governor of the State of Missouri DEAR SIR: It is the desire of the directors of the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad Company to relieve the state of Missouri from the burden which the state assumed in pursuance of a wise and liberal policy to aid the construction of the road when the company was in its infancy. The interest upon the three millions of state aid bonds had been regularly paid by us, including the coupons due January 1, 1881. We now wish to pay into the treasury of the state the entire sum of principal and the accrued interest since that date, in fulfillment of the obligation which rests upon the company to provide for the payment of bonds. This course appears to have been contemplated in the act of the legislature of the state of Missouri, entitled 'An act to provide for reducing the indebtedness of the state,' approved February 20, 1865. So long a time has elapsed since the passage of that act that we have considered it our duty to communicate with you upon the subject, in the first instance, in order that there may be a full understanding and co-operation in the action of the railroad company and the officers of the state. We should be very glad to receive any suggestion which may occur to you affecting the convenience of the state, or the duties of the officers of the state, depending upon our proposed action. It is our desire to complete the transaction as soon as possible after the period which must expire before a meeting of the company can be had to approve the necessary arrangements.

After this letter was received by the governor, Mr. Walker, the auditor of state, went to New York, where he had an interview with the officers of the company. At this interview propositionsw ere made on both sides, but no conclusion was reached. On the return of Mr. Walker from New York, he made a report in writing to the board of fund commissioners, under date of February 24, 1881, giving an account of what he had done and the suggestions he had made. This report was communicated by the governor to the general assembly the next day, accompanied by a message, of which the following is a copy:

25
'EXECUTIVE OFFICE, CITY OF JEFFERSON, February 25, 1881.

26
'SIR: I have the honor to lay before you a communication from Hon. John Walker to the board of fund commissioners of Missouri. Mr. Walker, as a member of that board, recently visited the city of New York for the purpose of conferring with the officers of the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad Company in regard to the proposition of that company to discharge the full amount of what it claims is its present indebtedness to the state. The result of Mr. Walker's conference with those officials is fully set forth in the accompanying communication. I recommend that you adopt such legislation as will enable the fund commissioners to use or dispose of whatever sum, if any, may be accepted by the state from the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad Company. I do not mean to say that the state will accept the sum of $in complete satisfaction of the liability incurred by the state in aid of said company. I think the liability extends to the maturity of the bonds; and as the company has heretofore met its obligations to the state promptly, and has thereby secured the confidence of the people of the state, who were for many years in doubt as to the final result of our complications with that road, I trust that it will be equally as honorable in the future, and so act as to retain the confidence which its past conduct has inspired. In case the whole or any part of the money due from the company is accepted, its receipt ought not to find us unprepared for its prompt and profitable disposal.

Afterwards the general assembly passed the following act, which was approved March 26, 1881:
30
31
'An act to provide for the transfer to the state sinking fund any surplus money that may be in the state treasury, not necessary to defray the current expenses of the state government, and to meet the appropriations made by law, and to authorize the fund commissioners to invest the same in the redemption or purchase of the bonds of the state and bonds of the United States, Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad bonds excepted.

32
'Be it enacted by the general assembly of the state of Missouri, as follows:

'Sec. 2.

On the thirtieth of April, 1881, the company executed to Rolston, Dowd, and Root, trustees, a mortgage, such as was contemplated by the act of February 20, 1865, and in which the provisions of that act were recited, to secure an issue of bonds to the amount of $ These bonds were negotiated by the trustees, and with the money realized therefrom, and $furnished by the company, they, on the twentieth of June, 1881, paid to the treasurer of state the full face of the bonds of the state for which the company was liable, and the unpaid interest thereon, to fall due July 1st thereafter, the total amount of principal and interest being $ and demanded from him the certificate provided for by the act of February 20, 1865, to entitle them to an assignment from the governor of the liens of the state. The treasurer thereupon gave the trustees a receipt, of which the following is a copy:

He refused to put the certificate in any other form, although requested to do so by the company.

No special provision was made by the company for the payment of the interest which fell due January 1, 1882; and on such failure the governor threatened to take measures for the enforcement of the lien which the state held under its statutory mortgages as upon a default by the company in the payment of interest. Thereupon the trustees began this suit, on the sixth of January, 1882, which was at first against the governor alone, to have him execute the assignment provided for by the act of and also to enjoin him from selling the road under the statutory mortgage. On the filing of the bill, a temporary restraining order was granted by the circuit judge. Afterwards, on the tenth of February, 1882, the court in session, being of opinion that the payment which had been made did not operate as a satisfaction of the obligation of the company to the state under the act of refused to grant a temporary injunction, but did not pass further on the rights of the parties. Ralston v. Crittenden, McCrary, 332. The company thereupon, to stop a sale by the governor, paid to the state the interest which fell due January 1, 1882, and the cause proceeded without any injunction. Afterwards, on the twentieth of March, an amended and supplemental bill was filed, on leave of the court, by which Chappell, the treasurer of state, and Walker, the auditor, were added as parties, and the railroad company also. The governor and auditor, with whom was united D. H. McIntyre, were also proceeded against as fund commissioners of the state, so that, if necessary, a decree might be had for a return of the money which had been paid. In other respects the prayer of the bill was not materially changed. Answers and replications were filed, and testimony taken. After hearing upon bill, answers, replication, and proofs, a decree was entered September 15, 1882, to the effect that the trustees were entitled under the act of to an assignment by the governor of the liens of the state upon payment to the treasurer of state of a sum of money, which, together with that alread paid, if it had been applied and invested within a reasonable time in accordance with the provisions of the act of March 26, 1881, would have indemnified the state against loss by reason of its obligation to pay interest on the bonds to their maturity, and 'that the complainants were and are entitled to have the said $paid as aforesaid to the said treasurer of the state of Missouri, under the provisions of the aforesaid act of February 20, applied and invested under and in accordance with the provisions of the said act of March 26, 1881, to the payment of the option bonds of the state of Missouri, known as bonds, as rapidly as they were subject to call and payment, and in the mean time, and until such bonds became subject to call and payment, or other portions of the state debt or interest thereon became due, to have the remaining and unapplied balance of the said moneys invested in bonds of the United States at the market rates, and when any portion of the said bonds became or should become subject to call and payment, or any portion of the state debt or interest thereon became or should be subject to redemption or payment, to have the said moneys applied from time to time to the redemption or payment thereof.'
47
48
The case was then referred to a master, to ascertain and report 'what sum, including the said $ was necessary to indemnify the state as aforesaid, if the same were applied and invested as hereinbefore provided, within reasonable time, in the exercise of due diligence by the officers of the state, after the twentieth of June, 1881.' In this decree the governor was enjoined from selling the road until a final judgment in the cause. From the report of the master, it appears that after the order of the court referring the case, the state officers used $of the money that had been paid in by the company to take up and pay an equal amount of option and other bonds of the state, which might have been called in at different times before while the money was in the treasury to the credit of the sinking fund. The remainder of the money was then invested, as it might have been before, in state bonds and United States bonds, at rates which would yield an interest on the investment equal to 3 per cent. per annum. The court below gave a decree, finding the amount to be paid to the state before the trustees could claim an assignment of the prior liens, calculated on the basis of applying the payment to taking up the bonds which had been issued to the company as they matured, and crediting the fund with 6 per cent. interest on the amount actually used to take up other bonds than those issued to the company at the rate of 6 per cent. from the time it ought to have been so used, and on the remainder at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum, which it was agreed was all that the investment that had been made in the purchase of state bonds and United States securities would produce. The amount thus found to be due was $ and interest at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum from May 11, 1883. The officers of the state claimed that the amount due should have been ascertained by charging the company with the face of the bonds, and interest to the date of their maturity, and crediting it only with the amount invested and the interest thereon at the rate of 3 per cent. until actually used to take up the bonds for which the company was liable. Each of the parties appealed from this decree.
48
49
What the state did under the acts of was to loan its credit to the railroad company. For this purpose it issued its bonds, with coupons for semi-annual interest attached, redeemable, part at the end of 20 years, and part at the end of 30. These bonds were delivered to the company, to be disposed of to raise money to enable it to expedite and secure the completion of its railroad, and in this way the state incurred a liability for the company, not only to pay the principal of the bonds to the holders thereof, but also to pay the interest semia nnually, at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, on some for at least 20 years, and on others for 30. The holder could not be required to take the principal and stop the interest until the state had the right by the terms of the bond to pay the principal. This was the liability of the state to the holders of the bonds for the benefit of the company, and the corresponding liability of the company to the state was to provide the state with the means for the punctual payment of the interest as it matured during the whole time the bonds had to run, and of the principal when it fell due. The company could no more require the state to take the principal before it became due, and stop interest thereafter, than the state could require the bondholders to do the same thing. The liability of the company to the state was identical with that of the state to the bondholders; for the duty of the company was to make such provision for the payment of both interest and principal as would 'exonerate the treasury of the state from any advances of money for that purpose.' This was the condition of the liability of the parties to and for each other under the original statutes when that of February 20, 1865, was enacted, during the late civil war, while the state was largely in default for interest on its debt, and when of necessity its securities were much depreciated. The avowed purpose of the statute was, according to its title, to reduce the indebtedness of the state, and it related only to the Hannibal & St. Joseph Company, which was not in default for either the interest or the principal of the bonds it was bound to make provision for. That company was authorized to raise money to get up the lien on its property in favor of the state, and pass it over to the holders of the new security upon the faith of which the money was to be got. Such a transfer could be obtained by paying 'into the treasury of the state a sum of money equal in amount to all indebtedness due or owing by said company to the state, and all liabilities incurred by the state by reason of having issued her bonds and loaned the same to said company as a loan of the credit of the state, together with all interest that has and may, at the time when said payment shall be made, have accrued and remain unpaid by said company,' (section 2,) or by delivering to the treasurer 'any of the outstanding bonds of the state bearing no less than six per cent. interest, or * * * unpaid coupons thereof at their par value,' amounting to 'three millions of dollars, and interest;' that is to say, to the amount of the bonds issued to the company by the state, and the accrued interest thereon, which had not already been paid by the company, (section 3.) This, as we construe the statute, means that, if payment is made in money, and not in state bonds or coupons, it must be of an amount equal to the face value of the bonds issued to the company and the accrued interest thereon to the time of payment, together with such further sum, if any, as would be necessary to enable the state to cancel then, or within a reasonable time thereafter, $of its oustanding liabilities, bearing interest at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum. This, we think, is shown in many ways. The avowed purpose of the act was to reduce the debt of the state. This could not be done by a simple payment by the company to the state of the amount of the bonds for which that company was liable. To reduce the debt, there must be a payment by the state to its own creditors, and an actual cancellation of its own obligations. As by accepting the money the state discharged the company from all further obligation to provide for the payment of the principal or the interest of the bonds for which it had become bound, it was necessary, in order to save the state from loss in the transaction, that the payment by the company should be enough to enable the state to take up and cancel an equal amount of its other indebtedness bearing the same rate of interest. The apparet object of the statute was to relieve the state to some extent from its immediate embarrassments. There was then existing a past due interest-bearing debt in the shape of unpaid coupons, amounting to more than the face value of the bonds for which the company was liable; and if the payment had been made at or about that time, the money could have been used at once in discharging an equal amount of debt then due and unpaid, without loss to the company or the state. Looked at in the light of the surrounding circumstances, the statute appears like a plan by the state to get relief to some extent from its present embarrassments, by an arrangement which would be equivalent to an issue of new payable at the times when those which had been lent to the company fell due. Apparently, the state was in no condition to borrow at favorable rates upon its own credit, and so a scheme was devised by which the prior lien of the state upon the railroad of this company might be used for that purpose, without any actual loss to the state, and possibly with some advantage to the company; for the company was allowed to make its payment in any of the bonds or past due coupons of the state bearing 6 per cent. interest at their par value, and if these could be got at a discount, the company would be correspondingly a gainer. Thus it appears that, if the payment had been made at or near the time the statute was enacted, an equal amount of the interest-bearing debt of the state, which was immediately pressing for payment, could have been taken up, and a cancellation of the obligations of the company secured. But no such payment was made, and the question now is whether 16 years afterwards, when the credit of the state had been re-established without any help from the company, and when all its 6 per cent. interest-bearing securities were commanding a high premium, the payment of the same amount would produce the same effect so far as the company was concerned.
49
50
Under the statute of as has already been, if payment was made in money, it must be of a sum, in addition to the face of the bonds, which would enable the state to take up and cancel an equal amount of its other 6 per cent. indebtedness then outstanding. Accordingly, when the company offered the amount of the face of the bonds only, and interest, the state officers insisted upon more, and, the parties failing to come to a satisfactory understanding on the subject, the whole matter was referred by the governor to the general assembly then in session. The statute of March 26, 1881, was the result of this reference, and, construed in connection with the circumstances which surrounded its enactment, it may be looked upon as a direction to the state officers to take the money when offered by the company, and use it as fast as needed to pay the option bonds when they were called in, which must be done at the earliest possible moment, and in the redemption and payment of other state bonds as they fell due. Whatever amount was not so used at once was to be invested and kept invested until it should afterwards be needed for that purpose. In this way the act of was recognized as being still in force, with the effect we have already given it; and the use of the money paid into the treasury by the company in taking up the 6 per cent. bonds of the state, whether option bonds or others, was made to operate as a discharge of the company from all liability for the payment of either the principal or interest of an equal amount of the bonds which had been issued for its benefit. The fund commissioners were also required to use the money as fast as it was needed for the payment of called or maturing bonds. With this statute in force, the company paid and the state officers received the money in question. There is some conflict of testimony as to what took place between Mr. Walker, the auditor of state, and the officers of the company, in New York, in February, 1881, and also as to what occurred between the company and the state of icers when the payment was made in June of the same year; but we have not deemed it necessary to give either of these matters any considerable attention, because the officers of the state could only do what was authorized by the statutes, which were enacted for the government of their conduct in the matter, and the rights of the parties depend alone upon the legal effect of those statutes.

By the constitution of Missouri, which went into effect in 1875, art. 10, § 14, it is made the duty of the legislature to levy and collect annually a tax sufficient to pay the accruing interest on the bonded debt of the state, and to reduce the principal thereof annually $is to be paid into and made a part of the sinking fund of the state. The tax thus provided for has been regularly levied and collected. From the report of the master, it now appears that $of the money paid in by the company was actually used by the fund commissioners on or before the twenty-third of August, 1882, in taking up option and other bonds of the state, and that, if this sum had been actually applied for that purpose at the times when the bonds so taken up became subject to call or payment, and the remainder of the fund had been applied to taking up other bonds of the state as they became due and payable, after making due allowance for the proper use of the $constitutional sinking fund each year, including the year it would require a further payment by the company, on the third day of October, to entitle the company to a discharge of its liability to the state on account of the bonds, and the trustees to an assignment of the liens of the state. It is conceded that the calculation of the master is right. The only question is as to the correctness of the principles on which it rests, and of this we are satisfied. In passing the act of March 26, the state substantially said to this company that any money it paid into the treasury under the act of should be put into the sinking fund, and used as soon as it was needed to meet the maturing debt of the state, and that, in order to use it at the earliest possible moment, all option bonds should be called in and paid as soon as it could be done according to law. Inasmuch as, before the act of was passed, the state had by its constitution made it imperative that a certain amount should be raised each year by taxation, and paid into the sinking fund to be applied to the liquidation of the state debt, it is but right that this should be exhausted as far as available before the money of the company is used; but after that is exhausted, the statute made it the duty of the commissioners to use any other money there might be in the fund to pay its bonds, whenever the right to make such payment should be complete. The state was not required to do this; but it did it, and the executive officers must govern themselves accordingly. It may be true that, if no such provision had been made, money might have been got by the state to take up such of its maturing bonds as could not be met by the accumulations of the annual contributions to the sinking fund out of the tax which the constitution had provided for that purpose, at a less rate of interest than 6 per cent., and thus a saving made; but this was for the consideration of the legislature when it passed the statute, not for the state officers afterwards. The state had the right to pass the law, and when passed, it was binding on those whose duty it was to obey. It was said, however, in argument, that, if the acts of and are construed in this way, they are invalid, because in conflict with the following provisions of the Missouri constitution, which went into effect November 30, 1875:
51
52
'Article 4, § 50. The general assembly shall have no power to release or alienate the lien held by the state upon any railroad, or in anywise change the tenor or meaning, or pass any act explanatory thereof; but the same shall be n forced in accordance with the original terms upon which it was acquired.'
52
53
'Section 51. The general assembly shall have no power to release or extinguish, or authorize the releasing or extinguishing, in whole or in part, the indebtedness, liability, or obligation of any corporation or individual to this state, or to any county or other municipal corporation therein.'
53
54
The supreme court of Missouri did say in State v. Chappell, a suit brought by these trustees to compel the state treasurer to give them a certificate of payment in the form required by the act of to enable them to get from the governor an assignment of the state's liens, that if the statutes required the acceptance of the $ at the time it was paid, in full satisfaction of the liability of the company to the state, they were unconstitutional and void. But here the question is whether the same result must follow when the statutes are construed so as to require the payment of a sum of money which will enable the state to take up an equal amount of its other indebtedness bearing an equal rate of interest, and we have no hesitation in saying it does not. Section 50 deals with the lien, and section 51 with the 'indebtedness, liability, or obligation.' The lien cannot be released or alienated until the debt is extinguished, and the debt cannot be released or extinguished except in the manner contemplated by the law under which it was created, or by something legally equivalent. Here there is a payment of the obligation in advance of its maturity, with a view to the use of the money so paid by the state in taking up other debts at their maturity, for which no other provision has been made. This is, in our opinion, the legal equivalent of a payment of the liability of the company in accordance with the original terms on which it was created. By the acts under which the payment was made the money was appropriated for use in this particular way. In the mean time it was to be kept in vested until that use could be made, the company indemnifying the state against its liability for interest in the mean time. A statute having such an effect violates neither the letter nor the spirit of the constitution, which was no doubt intended, as was said by the supreme court of Missouri in the case just cited, to prevent the 'frittering away' and 'extinguishment' of 'the liens held by the state on railroads' without payment in full. The payment in this case in the way which the statutes contemplate will be the complete legal equivalent of such a 'payment in full.'
54
55
It is next contended that this suit cannot be maintained, because it is in its effect a suit against the state, which is prohibited by the eleventh amendment of the constitution of the United States, and Louisiana v. Jumel, Sup. Ct. Rep. is cited in support of this position. But this case is entirely different from that. There the effort was to compel a state officer to do what a statute prohibited him from doing. Here the suit is to get a state officer to do what a statute requires of him. The litigation is with the officer, not the state. The law makes it his duty to assign the liens in question to the trustees, when they make a certain payment. The trustees claim they have made this payment. The officer says they have not, and there is no controversy about his duty if they have. The only inquiry is, therefore, as to the fact of a payment according to the requirements of the law. If it has been made, the trustees are entitled to their decree. If it has not, a decree in their favor, as the case now stands, must be denied; but as the parties are all before the court, and the suit is in equity, it may be retained so as to determine what the trustees must do in order to fulfill the law, and under what circumstances the governor can be compelled to execute the assignment which has been provided for.
55
56
The decree of the circuit court is reversed, so far as it fixed the amount to be pai to get an assignment of the lien, and the cause remanded, with instructions to strike out the sum of $ with interest from May 11, 1883, as the amount found due, and insert in lieu thereof $ and interest at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum from October 3, 1882. In all other respects the decree is affirmed, each party to pay its own costs in this court, the expenses of printing the record and the fees of the clerk for supervision to be taxed one-half to each.

GRIER
v.
WILT.1
March 7, 1887.
1
This is a suit in equity brought in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Delaware, by John F. Wilt against George S. Grier, for the infringement of letters patent No. granted to Asa Quincy Reynolds, May 1, 1877, for an 'improvement in automatic fruit-driers.' The specification, drawings, and claims of the patent are as follows:
1
2
'Figure 1 is a partial section and elevation of my improved fruit-drier, showing the same as being located over an ordinary stove, and illustrating a simple means of elevating the machine. Fig. 2 is a similar view, showing the drier as located over a large furnace, as in the most extensive dry-houses. Fig. 3 is a perspective view, illustrating the improved drier in a position removed from over an ordinary cooking-stove. Fig. 4 is a perspective view of a fragment of a square tray or section, showing more plainly the metallic lining and the sockets and pins, which may be conveniently used in this form of tray. Fig. 5 is a similar view of a fragment of a round tray or section, showing also the tin or metallic lining. Like letters of reference in all the figures indicate corresponding parts.
2
3
'The object of my invention is to simplify the construction of the fruitdriers in common use, both for domestic and factory purposes, reducing the cost, increasing the efficiency, and rendering them easier to be manipulated, and at the same time fire-proof, and capable of being enlarged or contrc ted at the pleasure of the operator; to accomplish all of which it [the invention] consists in certain details of construction and combination of parts, as will be hereinafter fully described, and then pointed out in the claims.
3
4
'In Fig. 1, N is an ordinary stove or heating-drum, over which is located the drier, consisting of a number of trays so constructed as that any one will receive a similar one above and also fit over a similar one below. For the lighter forms of driers I propose to make these trays of the ordinary sieves, or build them in the same manner, with perhaps two or more braces beneath the foraminated bottom, to give it sufficient
4
5
strength to support the weight of fruit. K is the main body of the tray, having a surrounding hoop, L. The several trays being of one size, (save the uppermost, to be hereinafter described,) it will be observed that each one will form a section of the wall of the drier, no matter what its position, and that this wall may be increased in height as much as desired or found necessary. A is a crane, and B a rope or chain running over it, and controlled by the windlass, O. From the crossbars, C, the ropes or chains, G, depend, and these are made to suspend the drier through the medium of the handles, H, H, etc., upon each tray. In order to prevent the drier from tipping when elevated, three or more handles should be employed in connection with a corresponding number of chains or ropes, G.
5
6
'At M is shown an iron ring, supported slightly above the top of the stove, N, and upon which the lower tray rests. The drier is built up as follows: Fruit having been suitably disposed in a tray, the hooks upon the lower ends of the ropes, G, are placed under two or more of the handles, H, H, on the lowermost tray of the drier already over the stove, and the whole is elevated by means of the windlass, O, a trifle more than the depth of one tray. The fresh tray is then placed upon the ring, M, and those above lowered upon it, being so guided by the hands that the hoop of the one to which the ropes are attached will fit over the top of the one placed thereunder. In this way the drier may be built as high as desired by the successive introduction of trays below. The swinging crane and windlass combined is regarded as the simplest means likely to be employed for elevating the drier.
6
7
'As the drying progresses, and the trays are elevated, the fruit therein becomes more and more compact or shriveled up, leaving a comparatively free passage for the heated air through the body of the drier, in consequence of which very much of said air would pass off without accomplishing the work intended, and, the partially cured fruit occupying considerably less space than the fresh, it is desirable that one or more smaller-sized trays be provided for its reception. Upon the top of the uppermost of the main series of trays I place a flange, F, having a circular opening, with upwardly-projecting collar, over which flange is located the tray, E, made in all respects similar to those below save as to its size. This flange serves to contract the flue formed by the series of trays below, and, if the partially dried fruit be placed in the tray, E. it will partially retard the flow of the air, and thus utilize so much thereof as would otherwise be wasted in the completion of the drying process. Above the flange, F, any number of small trays, E, may be placed, being matched one upon the other in a manner similar to those below. Within each tray I propose to place a metallic lining, t, t, (preferably of bright tin,) the object of which is to protect the wood of the trays from heat, and prevent moisture from penetrating the same.
7
8
'In Fig. 2 the series of trays forming the dry-house is shown as located over a large furnance placed below the flooring, Q. This form is intended for the larger sizes of dry-houses, and is not different, in principle or construction, from that already described, exe pt in that no hoops are illustrated as being placed upon the trays. These may be connected or matched with each other by any desirable and appropriate means. It may be found advantageous to construct the trays in other forms than circular, as indicated in Fig. 4, wherein the pin, p, and socket, P, are secured at suitable points upon the outside, and arranged to engage with similar sockets and pins upon the trays above and below, after the manner adopted in 'moulders' flasks,' and the like.
8
9
'With the swinging crane the drier may be moved from over the stove, as shown at Fig. 3, when the ordinary cooking operations may be performed, and the drier returned at pleasure; or, if desirable, the drier may be elevated above the stove, leaving sufficient space between the two for the cooking utensils, and thus the drying and cooking processes be conducted simultaneously. At D, Figs. 1 and 2, is a swivel connection, by means of which the series of trays may be revolved, and thus the drying equalized throughout. As fast as the fruit is thoroughly cured, the trays are removed from the top, and may then be inserted at bottom, after having been charged with a fresh supply.
9
10
'In all fruit-driers it is observed that the material is liable to contract of shrivel in such a manner as to open passages for the heated air, in consequence of which the fruit in the trays is unequally dried, the air passing off through these passages without coming in contact with the surrounding fruit This difficulty has given rise to numerous inventions calculated to obviate it among the most noticeable of which are revolving trays, and revolving covers or shields for said trays. These are found, in practice, expensive to build, difficult to handle and move, and liable to get out of order; and it is a very important feature of the present invention to do away with all these objections. This I accomplish by the introduction of a fan-wheel calculated to retard the ascending currents of heated air, and to distribute them uniformly across the whole area of the fruit-containing tray. In Fig. 1, the wheel, W, composed of a series of inclined blades, is pivoted between the two bars, g, g, which are attached to the metallic lining, t, before alluded to. It is sufficiently elevated above the foraminated bottom, I, as not to interere with the placing of fruit upon said bottom, if desired. The inclined blades cause the wheel to be rapidly revolved by the ascending currents of air, and these, meeting with a resistance, are compelled to pass by the blades in a uniform manner, said blades being so cut or separated as that they shall permit the passage of an equal quantity of air at every point below the bottom of the tray placed next above. Any number of these fans may be placed in the series of trays, as is apparent from the construction above described. They are automatically operated, not liable to get out of repair, and they are found to be very efficient for the purposes intended. If the currents of air be very rapid and strong, the revolutions of the wheels are correspondingly rapid, and thus, under all circumstances, the currents are automatically regulated and always evenly distributed. For the larger sized driers, the wheel, W, may advantageously be placed immediately over the funnel mouth, S, conducting the heated air from the furnace below, as in Fig. 2. It may be pivoted in any desirable way, and other fans may be distributed throughout the series of trays. When the trays are made in square form, one fan, occupying as much space therein as possible, will be found to work satisfactorily. If the trays be made oblong, then two fans might be introduced, the better to occupy the necessary space. They should, of course, be made to work upon the same level. These wheels have now come to be donominated 'fiutter-wheels,' and I desire to be understood as not limiting my invention to any particular number to be employed, to any specified location of said we els in the drier, or to any particular method or suspending the same, so long as they are made to revolve independently of the trays, and to accomplish the results intended.
10
11
'Having thus fully described my invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by letters patent, is:
11
12
(1) In combination with a series of fruitdrying trays, located one above the other, a second or supplementary series smaller than the first, and adapted to operate as and for the purposes explained.
12
13
(2) The plate, F, adapted to cover the flue formed by the lower series of trays, and to receive and hold the upper series, the whole being arranged and combined substantially as set forth. (3) In combination with a fruit-drying tray, a fan-wheel operated by the ascending currents of heated air, movable independently of said tray, and adapted to equalize the currents of air, in the manner set forth. (4) In combination with a fruit-dryer, the outer wall of which is made up of the frames of the several trays, as explained, a suspending device, operating substantially as described, and supporting said drier from point in or on the lowermost tray thereof, for the objects named. (5) In combination with a fruit-drier adapted to be elevated, in the manner described, and suspended above a stove or furnace, a suspending device, substantially as shown, provided with a swivel connection, as and for the purposes set forth.'
13
14
Infringement of the fourth claim only is alleged; the defendant's apparatus being that described in letters patent No. granted to him October 28, 1879, for an 'improvement in fruit-driers.' The description and drawings of that apparatus, in the specification of that patent, are as follows:
14
15
'The nature of my invention consists in the construction and arrangement of a fruit evaporator, as will be hereinafter more fully set forth. In order to enable others skilled in the art to which my invention appertains to make and use the same, I will now proceed to describe its construction and operation, referring to the annexed drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side elevation of my improved fruit evaporator. Fig. 2 is a sectional view of the same. Fig. 3 shows the bottom of the drier. Fig. 4 is a vertical section of the roof. Fig. 5 shows one of the boxes with removable trays.
15
16
'A represents a bed-frame, of suitable dimensions, provided with four upright posts, B, B, between which the boxes are placed for forming the walls of the evaporator and holding the trays. In the bottom frame, A, are two straight bars, C, C, crossing each other at right angles in the center, and dividing the bottom of the evaporator into four equal divisions. In each division is arranged a series of inclined slats, a, a, and the four series of said slats are inclined outward in the four different directions, whereby, when the evaporator is set over the furnace, the current of hot air, as it ascends, is directed to the sides of the machine. D, D, represent the boxes which go to form the walls of the evaporator, and which are open at top and bottom. Each box contains one or more removable trays, b, which rest upon cleats, d, on the inside of the box. The upper edges of the side bars of each box, D, are made V shaped, while in their under edges are made corresponding grooves, so that the boxes will fit close together, and can easily be moved back and forth. The outer sides of these side bars of the boxes have two or more horizontal notches, x, x, at each end, into which take pivoted pawls, h, h. These pawls are pivoted to vertically movable posts or uprights, I, I, which are connected to the sationary corner posts, B, B, by means of rods of bars, m, attached to each post, I, and passing vertically through eyes, i, in a groove on the stationary post, B. Each movable upright, I, is provided with a rack-bar, n, and the two rack-bars on the same side of the evaporator are operated by pinions, p, on a horizontal shaft, H. The two shat s, H, H, on opposite sides of the evaporator, are operated by worms, J, J, on a shaft, K, at one end of the evaporator; said worms taking into gear-wheels, L, L, on the ends of the shafts, H, H, The shaft, K, is provided with hand-wheels, M, M, for turning the same.
16
17
'In operation, the first box, having its tray or trays filled with fruit, is pushed in over the heater or furnace, and after being there say about ten minutes, more or less, as desired, it is raised up by the gearing and the pawls, h, attached to the movable uprights, I, and another or second box, similarly filled with fruit, pushed in under the first, and the first lowered down on the second, and so on until twenty or more boxes with trays have been arranged to form the evaporator. It will be noticed that with my mechanism I lift each box independently of the others, so that I can lift a portion above, leaving the boxes of the lower part stationary, by disengaging the pawls below. This enables the operator to examine any one or more of the boxes by sliding them out while those above are suspended.
17
18
'N represents the cover with central stack, O. This cover is put on the first box to cause a draught, and it is raised by resting on the top or first box, so that the evaporator is complete at all times, whether one or twenty or more boxes are inserted. In the cover, N, is a bottom, P, which does not extend to the outer edges of the cover, thereby causing the vapor and heated air to be drawn from the middle to the sides to dry evenly, and it also aids in carrying off the fumes of the sulphur when such is used to bleach the fruit. I am aware that a fruit evaporator has been made with upright sliding bars or posts provided with spring-pawls, which pass under the trays to support the same, but in such case the pawls are inaccessible, and none of them can be thrown out of the way; whereas in my case the operator can easily disengage any one or more pawls on each post, so as to lift any one or more boxes, or all the boxes together, as may be desired.'
18
19
The case was brought to a hearing on pleadings and proofs, the main issue raised by the answer, and contested, being that of infringement. The circuit court entered a decree in favor of the plaintiff, awarding a perpetual injunction and a reference as to profits and damages, in pursuance of which a final decree was rendered against the defendant for $ with interest and costs, from which he has appealed. The circuit court, in its decision, () said:
19
20
'This patent [the plaintiff's] is for an improvement in automatic fruitdriers, and its peculiarity and novelty consist in mechanical arrangements and devices by which a stack of trays, fitting into each other, the outer edges of which constitute the outer side of the stack of trays or drying-house, are moved upwards, and suspended by attachments to the lower tray, in order that a fresh tray of fruit can be inserted at the bottom, and the process repeated at pleasure, thus building up the drying-house or stack from the bottom. It is not contended that the patentee is the inventor of the movable trays, the outer walls of which constitute the drying-house. It is admitted that the existence of such trays, for such purpose, is old in the art; but the complainant contends that the patentee is the originator of an idea, which is a novel and useful one, of raising the stack of trays from a point on the lowermost tray of the stack, thus making an opening for the insertion of a fresh tray containing fruit, and in this manner building the stack up from the bottom, instead of from the top; * * * the object and value of the patent consisting not in the use of any special machinery for elevating the stack for the purposes intended, but the elevation and opening of the said stack at the bottom, for those purposes, by any machinery best calculated to attain that end. * * * The court is therefore of the opinion that any attempt by defendant, or any other person, to elevae the stack of trays so constructed as aforesaid, and from a point at or on the lowermost tray thereof, so as to insert new trays at the bottom successively, by any mechanism whatever, adapted to accomplish that purpose, and which is a mechanical equivalent to the means employed by the complainant, is an infringement of his patent. * * *
20
21
'The two machines, as will be manifest upon reference to the specifications and drawings in the respective patents, are alike in principle, having a stack in each case composed of sections of trays, fitting upon and into each other, the outer wall of which makes up and forms the exterior of said stack or Drying-house; and they are also soIke in their purpose and capacity of being moved upward from a point in or on the lowermost tray, and of being suspended in that position so as to admit the insertion of fresh trays in succession. They are unlike in their respective applicances and devices by which these objects are accomplished, and also in the facility by which intermediate trays between the top and bottom can be removed. The devices by which the trays in the complainant's patent are elevated in the manner described, for the purposes mentioned, are the cord and pulley passing over an upright crane, regulated by a windlass, or wheel and axle, with its ratchet and pawls, * * * the point of suspension * * * being directly over the center of the stack; and from the ends of the cross-bars to which the rope passing through the pulley is attached, depend ropes or chains, which are attached by hooks to handles upon the lowermost tray to be removed, thus contributing both a lifting and suspending device. * * * The machine embodying the defendant's invention * * * exhibits the following means for effecting the elevation of the stack of trays, and their suspension, for the purpose of allowing new trays to be inserted at the bottom, to-wit, four movable uprights, each having a series of pivoted pawls, and arranged to slide in four stationary posts, secured in a frame, in combination with a series of boxes or trays having notches in their sides, whereby the boxes may be lifted independently of each other or all together. The power is applied through the medium of two worms, situated at each end of a drum or shaft, extending along the side of, and at least the width of, the stack to be lifted. These worms engage into appropriate cog-wheels, affixed to two other drums or shafts running at right angles to the first-named shaft, on opposite sides of the stack, and extend horizontally the length of the same. Upon each of these last-mentioned shafts are geared, at the ends of the same, small cog-wheels, which, in turn, gear into vertical rack-bars on the four sliding posts of the machine. The power is applied by means of a crank at the end of the first-named drum or shaft.
21
22
'Now, here is undoubtedly a contrivance and device by which the novel and useful invention, first patented in the Reynolds patent, * * * of elevating the stack of trays from a point in or on the lowermost tray thereof, so as to permit the insertion of a fresh tray at the bottom, is accomplished. It matters not whether this device has the capacity of lifting the upper trays in the series, so as to open the same for inspection or for any other purposes. So long as it accomplishes the purpose, or possesses the capacity of moving up the whole series of trays from a point on the lowermost tray of the same, so as to permit the introduction of a fresh tray, it is, in that respect, an infringement of the complainant's patent; nor is this conclusion altered because of any supposed advantages gained by the greater facility afforded by the Grier patent in opening the stack at any point above the lowermost tray, for purposes of inspection or otherwise. * * * The court, upon the best consideration it can give to this subject, has come to the conclusion that the defendant in this cause has used, in the elevation and suspension of the stack of trays in this drier, mechanical p pliances and contrivances which, while they differ some what in form from those used by the complainant, are mechanical substitutes and equivalents for the same; and, in the use of the same for the accomplishment of the same results as those produced by the complainant's invention, the defendant has infringed upon the exclusive rights secured to the complainant.'
22
23
The specification of the plaintiff's patent states that the invention 'consists in certain details of construction and combinations of parts.' The existence, in a fruit-drier, of movable trays, the outer walls of which constitute the drying-house, being old, the subject of the fourth claim is the arrangement, in a fruit-drier with such trays, of a suspending device connected with the drier in or on the lowermost tray, so as to raise that tray, with all the trays above it, and allow the insertion, underneath all, of a fresh tray, and then lower the trays above it, and couple the suspending device again to the lowermost tray, and so on. This is the effect or result of the mode of operation of the devices. The claim, however, is not for a process, but is only for mechanism. The decision of the circuit court seems to be based on the view that the claim covers all methods of raising the lowermost tray with those above it, if opportunity is given to insert a fresh tray underneath; and that, while the appliances and devices of the plaintiff and defendant are unlike each other, the defendant infringes because he attains the same result, of inserting a fresh tray underneath while the trays before inserted are moved up and held up by a force imparted to the lowermost one of them. The decision describes the invention as consisting in 'elevating the stack of trays from a point in or on the lowermost tray thereof, so as to permit the insertion of a fresh tray at the bottom;' and it, in effect, regards all mechanism for causing such elevation in such manner as a mechanical equivalent for the patented mechanism, because the result is to allow a fresh tray to be inserted underneath. And this is the view urged here by the appellee.
23
24
The defendant introduced in evidence three United States patents,—one to Adam Snyder, No. for a 'fruit-drier;' one to Joseph B. Okey and Ferdinand A. Lehr, No. for an 'improvement in fruit-driers;' and one to Joel Orlando Button, No. September 22, 1874, for an 'improvement in fruit-driers.' Their introduction was objected to by the plaintiff, because they were not set up in the answer. But they were receivable in evidence to show the state of the art, and to aid in the construction of the plaintiff's claim, though not to invalidate that claim on the ground of want of novelty, when properly construed. Vance v. Campbell, Railroad Co. v. Dubois, Brown v. Piper, Eachus v. Broomall, Sup. Ct. Rep. 
24
25
The Snyder patent and the Okey and Lehr patent show, each of them, in a fruit-drier, a series of trays, arranged one above another, so that the frames of the trays form the wall of the drier. The Button patent shows a fruitdrier within which is a movable frame, which carries racks that rest upon each other. The racks are inserted through a door immediately above the frame, one by one, and each one is separately elevated on the frame by cam levers till it is held by spring catches, which move back while a rack is being elevated, and as soon as it passes spring out and support it, while the frame is being lowered for another rack. Each rack goes up with the frame, and, having been inserted at the extreme bottom, it carries up the racks above it, when it reaches them, and so on until they can be successively taken out at the top. The frames of the trays, which thus rest on each other, constitute, in a measure and to a degree, the walls of a chamber in which the drying takes place. Movable trays, the outer walls of which constituted the drying h ambers, being old, and apparatus having existed before to raise a tray or rack, and a column of racks above it, and insert a fresh one at the bottom, and the two having been used in connection, the fourth claim of the plaintiff's patent must be limited to the mechanism described and shown. The circuit court made no reference to the Button patent.
25
26
The plaintiff's patent describes and claims 'a suspending device, operating substantially as described.' The defendant has no such suspending device. The plaintiff has a crane, with suspended ropes, and his lowermost tray, while being raised, necessarily carries on it the weight of all the trays and fruit above it. In the defendant's apparatus each tray can be lifted independently of the others, and each tray is supported independently, so that the weight of the series of trays, and of the fruit on them, need not rest entirely on the lowermost tray. This result being different from that in the plaintiff's device, the mechanism is different, and is not an equivalent of that of the plaintiff, any more than the plaintiff's is the equivalent of Button's. The fourth claim of the patent, if valid, cannot be construed so as to cover the defendant's apparatus.
26
27
The decree of the circuit court is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court, with a direction to dismiss the bill of complaint, with costs.

The defendant below, the plaintiff in error here, Frederick Hopt, was indicted in the district court of the Third judicial district of Utah, in December, 1880, for the murder of John F. Turner on the third of the preceding July. He was four times convicted in that court, upon this indictment, of murder in the first degree. The judgment of death pronounced against him on each previous conviction was reversed by this court. The decisions are found in Sup. Ct. Rep. Sup. Ct. Rep. The last conviction took place in September, 1885. Judgment was passed in October following; and on appeal to the supreme court of the territory it was affirmed in January 1886, except as to the time of its execution; that was to be fixed by the district court, to which the cause was remanded for that purpose. To secure a reversal of this judgment the case is brought before us on a writ of error. The errors assigned are (1) the ruling of the trial court upon challenges to several jurors; (2) the admission in evidence of the opinion of a witness as to the direction from which the blow was delivered which caused the death of the deceased; (3) the instruction to the jury as to the meaning of the words 'reasonable doubt;' and (4) the reference on the argument by the district attorney to previous trials of the case.

1. Four persons summoned as jurors were examined on their voir dire, and challenged by the defendant, one for actual bias, under section of the act of the territory regulating proceedings in criminal cases, passed in 1878, and the other three for both actual and implied bias. Actual bias is defined by that act to be 'the existence of a state of mind, on the part of a juror, which leads to a just inference in reference to the case that he will not act with entire impartiality.' The juror Young, challenged as having that state of mind, that is, for actual bias, testified that he had heard of the case, but had never talked with any one who pretended to know about it; that he had impressions as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant, but could not say that he had ever formed any opinion on the subject, and did not remember that he had ever expressed any; that possibly his impressions were strong enough to create, from sympathy, some bias or prejudice, but he thought he could sit on the jury and be guided by the evidence, and try the case impartially, as if he had never heard of it before. Upon this testimony, the court was of opinion that he was a competent juror, and accordingly the challenge was disallowed. In this ruling we see no error. The juror was then peremptorily challenged by the defendant, and was excused. That act also provides, in section that a challenge for implied bias may be taken for all or any of the following causes, and for no other: (1) Consanguinity or affinity within the fourth degree to the person alleged to be injured by the offense charged, or on whose complaint the prosecution was instituted, or to the defendant. (2) Standing in the relation of guardian and ward, attorney and client, master and servant, or landlord and tenant, or being a member of the family of the defendant, or of the person alleged to be injured by the offense charged, or on whose complaint the prosecution was instituted, or in his employment on wages. (3) Being the party adverse to the defendant in a civil action, or having complaint against or being accused by him in a criminal prosecution.( 4) Having served on the grand jury which found the indictment, or on a coroner's jury which inquired into the death of a person whose death is the subject of the indictment. (5) Having served on a trial jury which has tried another person for offense charged in the indictment. (6) Having been one of the jury formerly sworn to try the same indictment, and whose verdict was set aside, or which was discharged without a verdict, after the case was submitted to it. (7) Having served as a juror in a civil action brought against the defendant for the act charged as an offense. (8) Having formed or expressed an unqualified opinion or belief that the prisoner is guilty or not guilty of the offense charged. (9) If the offense charged be punishable with death, the entertaining of such conscientious opinions as would preclude his finding the defendant guilty; in which case he must neither be permitted nor compelled to serve as a juror. The act provides, in section that, 'in a challenge for implied bias, one or more of the causes stated in section must be alleged.' Laws .

Another act of the territory, passed in March, 1884, declares that 'no person shall be disqualified as a juror by reason of having formed or expressed an opinion upon the matter or cause to be submitted to such jury, [juror,] founded upon public rumor, statements in public journals, or common notoriety: provided it appear to the court, upon his declaration, under oath or otherwise, that he can and will, notwithstanding such an opinion, act impartially and fairly upon the matters submitted to him. The challenge may be oral, but must be entered in the minutes of the court or of the phonographic reporter.' Laws .

The juror Gabott, challenged for both actual and implied bias, testified OL his direct examination, in substance, as follows: That he had heard of the case through the newspapers, and read what was represented to be the evidence; that he had talked about it since that time; that he did not think he had ever expressed an opinion on the case, but that he had formed a qualified opinion,—that is, if the evidence were true, or the reports were true; that he had an opinion touching the guilt or innocence of the accused which it would take evidence to remove; but that he thought he could go into the jury-box and sit as if he had never heard of the case, and that what he had heard would not make the least difference. On his cross-examination, he testified that he knew nothing about the case, except what he had read from time to time in the public press; that, if what he had heard turned out to be the facts in the case, he had an opinion, otherwise not,—that is, his opinion was a qualified one, and that, according to his present state of mind, he could sit on the jury and determine the case without reference to anything he had heard; that he was not conscious of any bias or prejudice that might prevent him from dealing with the defendant impartially; and that he thought he could try the case according to the law and the evidence given in court. On his re-examination he further stated that he would be guided by the evidence altogether, without being influenced by any opinion he might then have, or may have previously formed. The court held that the juror was competent. By the express terms of the statute of he could not be disqualified as a juror for an opinion formed or expressed upon statements in public journals, if it appeared to the court upon his declaration, under oath or otherwise, that he could and would, notwithstanding such an opinion, act impartially and fairly upon the matters submitted to him. We think that evidence, or what purports to be evidence, printed in a newspaper, is a 'statement in a public journal,' within the meaning of the statute; and that the judgment of the court upon the competency of the juror in such cases is conclusive.

The juror Winchester, who was also challenged for actual and implied bias, testified that he hadh eard of the case through the papers; that he had heard it talked of some years ago; that he believed he had heard what purported to be the evidence as given in the newspapers on previous trials, and believed he had formed and expressed an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, and though it was an unqualified opinion, it was not a fixed or settled one; that, at the time he read the papers, he had formed such an opinion as would have required testimony to remove it from his mind, and if his memory was refreshed as to the testimony, there would probably be a renewal of the opinion he had formed; that he had not talked with any one, and could hardly tell the circumstances now; that he believed that his mind was free from any impression, and that he could sit on the jury and try the case precisely as if he had never heard of it or read of any of the facts. To inquiries of the court, the juror repeated, in substance, what he had previously said,—that he thought he could sit in the jury-box and try the case according to the evidence without reference to any opinion he may then or theretofore have formed; that he could try the defendant impartially according to the evidence, and that he would do so. The court thereupon held that he was competent, and the challenge was disallowed. This ruling disposed of the challenge, and the judgment of the court, for the reasons stated, was conclusive under the statute of March, 1884. The defendant thereupon peremptorily challenged the juror, and he was excused.

The fourth juror, Harker, who was challenged for actual and implied bias by the defendant, was examined on his voir dire disallowed; and thereupon the district attorney peremptorily challenged him, and he was excused. The challenges for implied bias fell, as there was no specification of the grounds for such challenges, as required by section of the act of .

In capital cases in Utah, the government and the accused are each allowed 15 peremptory challenges. Laws Utah Notwithstanding the peremptory challenges made by the defendant to two of the jurors, he had several such challenges which had not been used when the jury was completed. If, therefore, the ruling of the court in disallowing the challenges to the two for bias, actual or implied, was erroneous, no injury to the defendant followed. Those jurors were not on the jury, and impartial and competent jurors were obtained in their place, to whom no objection was made. Hayes v. Missouri, Sup. Ct. Rep. Mimms v. State, Erwin v. State, It is therefore only the ruling on the challenge to the juror Gabott which can properly be assigned as error here; and, for the reasons stated, that ruling was in our judgment correct.

2. The deceased came to his death from a blow inflicted upon the left side of his head, which crushed his skull. A post mortem examination of the body was made by a physician, who was allowed, against the objection of the defendant, to give his opinion as to the direction from which the blow was delivered, after he had stated that his examination of the body had enabled him to form an intelligent opinion upon that point. The ground of the objection was that the direction in which the blow was delivered was not a matter for the opinion of an expert, but one which should be left to the jury. The court overruled the objection, and the defendant excepted. The witness stated, as his opinion, that the blow was delivered from behind and above the head of the person struck, and from the left towards the right. This testimony was supposed to have some bearing upon the case when considered in connection with the fact that the accused was a left-handed man. On the following morning, counsel on behalf of the prosecution moved that this evidence should be stricken from the record, and the jury be instructed to disregard it. The counsel for the defendant did not object to that; but he wished the record to show that the application was made on the following morning. The court thereupon instructed the jury that the evidence was stricken out, and that they were not to consider it at all. The defendant now contends that it was error to admit the evidence, and that the error was not cured by striking it out and the instruction to the jury. To this the answer is (1) that the evidence was admissible; and (2) that, if not admissible, the error was cured by the evidence being stricken out with the accompanying instruction. The opinions of witnesses are constantly taken as to the result of their observations on a great variety of subjects. All that is required in such cases is that the witnesses should be able to properly make the observations, the result of which they give; and the confidence bestowed on their conclusions will depend upon the extent and completeness of their examination, and the ability with which it is made. The court below, after observing that every person is competent to express an opinion upon a question of identity, as aplied to persons in his family or to handwriting, and to give his judgment in regard to the size, color, and weight of objects, and to make an estimate as to time and distance, cited a great number of cases illustrative of this doctrine. We quote a passage containing them. 'He may state his opinion,' says the court, 'with regard to sounds, their character, from what they proceed, and the direction from which they seem to come. State v. Shinborn, Com. v. Pope, Com. v. Dorsey, Non-experts have been allowed to testify whether certain hairs were human, (Com. v. Dorsey, ) that one person appeared to be sincerely attached to another, (McKee v. Nelson, ) as to whether another was intoxicated, (People v. Eastwood, ) as to whether a person's conduct was insulting, (Raisler v. Springer, ) as to resemblance of foot-tracks, (Hotchkiss v. Germania Ins. Co., 5 Hun, 90;) as to value of property when competent, (Brown v. Hoburger, 52 Barb. 15; Bank v. Mudgett, Bedell v. Long Insland R. Co., Id. Swan v. Middlesex Co., Snyder v. Western Union R. Co., 25 Wis. 60; Brackett v. Edgerton, Gil. 134;) as to market value of cattle, derived from newspapers, (Cleveland R. Co. v. Perkins, ) whether there was hard pan in an excavation, (Currier v. Boston & Maine R. R., ) whether one acted as if she felt sad, (Culver v. Dwight, ) as to rate of speed of a railroad train on a certain occasion, (Detroit, etc., v. Van Steinburg, 17 Mich. 99;) as to whether noisome odors render a dwelling uncomfortable, (Kearney v. Farrel, ) whether the witness noticed any change in the intelligence or understanding or any want of coherence in the remark of another, (Barker v. Comins, Nash v. Hunt, )' Upon the same principle, the testimony of the physician as to the direction from which the blow was delivered was admissible. It was a conclusion of fact, which he would naturally draw from the examination of the wound. It was not expert testimony in the strict sense of the term, but a statement of a conclusion of fact, such as men who use their senses constantly draw from what they see and hear in the daily concerns of life. Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Lathrop, Sup. Ct. Rep. But, independently of this consideration, as to the admissibility of the evidence, if it was erroneously admitted, its subsequent withdrawal from the case, with the accompanying instruction, cured the error. It is true, in some instances, there may be such strong impressions made upon the minds of a jury by illegal and improper testimn y that its subsequent withdrawal will not remove the effect caused by its admission; and in that case the original objection may avail on appeal or writ of error. But such instances are exceptional. The trial of a case is not to be suspended, the jury discharged, a new one summoned, and the evidence retaken, when an error in the admission of testimony can be corrected by its withdrawal, with proper instructions from the court to disregard it. We think the present case one of that kind. State v. May, Goodnow v. Hill, Smith v. Whitman, Hawes v. Gustin, Dillin v. People, Specht v. Howard.

3. The instruction to the jury, which is the subject of exception, relates to the meaning of the words 'reasonable doubt,' which should control them in their decision. The following is that portion which bears upon this subject: 'The court charges you that the law presumes the defendant innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. That if you can reconcile the evidence before you upon any reasonable hypothesis consistent with the defendant's innocence, you should do so, and in that case find him not guilty. You are further instructed that you cannot find the defendant guilty unless, from all the evidence, you believe him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further charges you that a reasonable doubt is a doubt based on reason, and which is reasonable in view of all the evidence. And if, after an impartial comparison and consideration of all the evidence, you can candidly say that you are not satisfied of the defendant's guilt, you have a reasonable doubt but if, after such impartial comparison and consideration of all the evidence, you can truthfully say that you have an abiding conviction of the defendant's guilt, such as you would be willing to act upon in the more weighty and important matters relating to your own affairs, you have no reasonable doubt.' The word 'abiding' here has the signification of 'settled and fixed,'—a conviction which may follow a careful examination and comparison of the whole evidence. It is difficult to conceive what amount of conviction would leave the mind of a juror free from a reasonable doubt, if it be not one which is so settled and fixed as to control his action in the more weighty and important matters relating to his own affairs. Out of the domain of the exact sciences and actual observation, there is no absolute certainty. The guilt of the accused, in the majority of criminal cases, must necessarily be deduced from a variety of circumstances leading to proof of the fact. Persons of spec ulative minds may in almost every such case suggest possibilities of the truth being different from that established by the most convincing proof. The jurors are not to be led away by speculative notions at to such possibilities.

In Com. v. Webster, the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts stated in its charge that it was not sufficient to establish a probability, though a strong one arising from the doctrine of chances, that the fact charged against the prisoner was more likely to be true than the contrary, and said: 'The evidence must establish the truth of the fact to a reasonable and moral certainty, a certainty that convinces and directs the understanding, and satisfies the reason and judgment of those who are bound to act conscientiously upon it. This we take to be proof beyond reasonable doubt.' The difficulty with this instruction is that the words 'to a reasonable and moral certainty' add nothing to the words 'beyond a reasonable doubt;' one may require explanation as much as the other. In Com. v. Costley, the same court held that, as applied to a judicial trial for crime, the two phrases were synonymous and equivalent, and that each signified such proof as would satisfy the judgment and consciences of the jury that the crime charged had been cm mitted by the defendant, and so satisfy them as to leave no other reasonable conclusion possible. It was there also said that an instruction to the jury that they should be satisfied of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, had often been held sufficient, without further explanation. In many cases it may undoubtedly be sufficient. It is simple, and as a rule to guide the jury is as intelligible to them generally as any which could be stated, with respect to the conviction they should have of the defendant's guilt to justify a verdict against him. But in many instances, especially where the case is at all complicated, some explanation or illustration of the rule may aid in its full and just comprehension. As a matter of fact, it has been the general practice in this country of courts holding criminal trials to give such explanation or illustration. The rule may be, and often is, rendered obscure by attempts at definition, which serve to create doubts instead of removing them. But an illustration like the one given in this case, by reference to the conviction upon which the jurors would act in the weighty and important concerns of life, would be likely to aid them to a right conclusion, when an attempted definition might fail. If the evidence produced be of such a convincing character that they would unhesitatingly be governed by it in such weighty and important matters, they may be said to have no reasonable doubt respecting the guilt or innocence of the accused, notwithstanding the uncertainty that attends all human evidence. The instruction in the case before us is as just a guide to practical men as can well be given; and if it were open to criticism, it could not have misled the jury, when considered in connection with the further charge, that if they could reconcile the evidence with any reasonable hypothesis consistent with the defendant's innocence, they should do so, and in that case find him not guilty. The evidence must satisfy the judgment of the jurors as to the guilt of the defendant, so as to exclude any other reasonable conclusion.
10
11
The instruction is not materially different from that given by Lord TENTERDEN, as repeated and adopted by Chief Baron POLLOCK, in Rex v. Muller. 'I have heard,' said the chief baron, addressing the jury, 'the late Lord TENTERDEN frequently lay down a rule which I will pronounce to you in his own language: 'It is not necessary that you should have a certainty which does not belong to any human transaction whatever. It is only necessary that you should have that certainty with which you should transact your own most important concerns in life.' No doubt the question before you to-day—involving as it does the life of the prisoner at the bar must be deemed to be of the highest importance; but you are only required to have that degree of certainty with which you decide upon and conclude your own most important transactions in life. To require more would be really to prevent the repression of crime, which it is the object of criminal courts to effect.' note. We are satisfied that the defendant was in no way prejudiced by the instructions of the court.
11
 On the final argument to the jury, the counsel for the prosecution alluded to the case as the most remarkable one ever tried in the territory, and to 'the many times it had been brought before the tribunals.' To this latter remark exception was taken. Thereupon the remark was withdrawn by the counsel, and the court said to the jury that the case was to be tried on the evidence, and that they were not to consider it with respect to any previous trial, but only on the evidence given on this trial. The counsel for the defendant now contends that this allusion was in contravention of that section of the act of the territory regulating proceedings in criminal cases, which declares that 'the granting of a new trial places the parties in the same position as if no trial had been had,' and that 'all the testimony must be produe d anew, and the former verdict cannot be used or referred to either in evidence or in argument.' Laws Utah The object of this law was to prevent the accused from being prejudiced by reference to any former conviction on the same indictment. There was, in fact, no reference to any verdict on a previous trial, but merely a mention of the times the case had been before the courts, so as to magnify its importance. If allusions to previous trials, such as were here made, were to vitiate a subsequent trial, a new element of uncertainty would be introduced into the administration of justice in criminal cases. We do not see that the defendant was in any way prejudiced by such reference. The fact that previous trials had proved unavailing may perhaps have induced greater care and caution on the part of the jury in the consideration of the case.

120 U.S. 442
PLUMMER, Adm'r, etc.,
v.
SARGENT and others.1
March 7, 1887.
1
This is a bill in equity to restrain the alleged infringement of reissued letters patent Nos. dated September 11, 1866, granted to the Tucker Manufacturing Company, as assignee of Hiram Tucker, and owned by the complainant; the former being for an improved process of bronzing or coloring iron, the latter for the product resulting from that process. The specifications in the reissued patent No. are as follows:
1
2
'Metals have heretofore been lacquered or bronzed by the application of a solution of resin and metallic powders or salts, and dried by exposure to air or heat. Iron has been japanned by covering its surface with oily solutions of asphaltum and pigments, and subsequent application of heat sufficient to produce hardness. These are well known operations. My invention consists in a process of covering iron with a very thin coating of oil, and then subjecting it to heat, the effect of which is to leave upon the iron a firm film, which is very durable, and gives the iron a highly ornamental appearance, like that of bronze.
2
3
'In practice, I proceed as follows: The surface of the iron is cleansed from sand, scale, or other foreign matter, and, where fine effects are desired, the surface is best made smooth or polished. Under given conditions of heating and oiling, the finer the polish the lighter is the bronze tint produced. In cases where ornamentation is obtained by relief, the salient parts should be the most highly polished or most smoothly surfaced, in order that the color produced upon them shall not be so deep as it is on those parts which are in the rear, so as to imitate thereby more nearly the effects of genuine bronze, in which its natural oxidation is apt to be worn somewhat away from its salient parts, and therefore lighter in color. When the iron is thus prepared I cover it with a very thin coating of linseed oil, or any oil which is the equivalent therefor, for the purpose here specified, (such a coating as I find best attained by applying the oil with a brush, and then rubbing off the oiled surface throughly with a rag, sponge, or other suitable implement,) and then place it in an oven, where it is submitted to a degree of heat which may be measured by an intensity sufficient to change a brightened surface of clean, unoiled iron to a color varying from a light straw color to a deep blue; the lowest degree of heat producing the lightest colored changes and the lightest bronze, and the highest degree of heat producing the darkest colored changes and the darkest bronze. It is important that the coating of oil be made extremely thin, as a coating of any material thickness will leave a rough or varied surface after the heat is applied. As the oiled iron becomes heated the color obtained will be bronze, of an intensity corresponding to the degree of heat employed; but it should be observed that the heat may be made so intense and so long continud as to destroy the oil, in which case the iron will lose the bronze tint acquired, and will assume the dark blue shade.
3
4
'The perfection of the results obtained under these instructions will, of course, depend, in a considerable degree, upon the dexterity and watchfulness of the operator in applying the oil, and in regulating the heat. In practice I prefer to use boiled linseed oil. When the desired shade of bronzing is obtained, the iron is removed from the oven or furnace, and, if desired, may again be treated with oil as before, even if not cool, and then again submitted to the action of heat, as described, and the operation of oiling and heating may be repeated indefinitely, each repetition deepening the shade of the bronzing. I recommend that at each repetition the degree of heat should be less than the degree immediately before employed; and in oiling and heating more than once I recommend for the second and succeeding oilings the use of a dry hog-hair brush to take off the surplus oil. The process may be carried to such an extent by repetition of oiling and heating as to produce a very dark color; black even may be thus produced.
4
5
'I have specially described linseed oil as preferred by me for the practice of my invention because of its good drying quality, and its capacity of giving a good, uniform, smooth film when spread thinly upon the iron, as before described. Slight variations from the degree of heat above mentioned may be allowed without departing from the principle of my invention.
5
6
'What I claim and desire to secure by letters patent is the process of ornamenting iron in imitation of bronze by the application of oil and heat, substantially as described.'
6
7
Reissued patent No. is for a new article of manufacture, but the description of the method is the same as that contained in the specifications in the patent for the process; the claim, however, being as follows: 'What I claim and desire to secure by letters patent is the new manufacture hereinabove described, consisting of iron ornamented in imitation of bronze by the application of oil and heat, substantially as described.'
7
8
These two reissues were based upon the surrender of a prior original patent, dated December 15, 1863, covering both claims. These reissued patents were the subject of litigation before Mr. Justice CLIFFORD in Tucker v. Tucker Manuf'g Co., and before Judge LOWELL in Tucker v. Burditt, and Tucker v. Dana, The decree below was in favor of the defendants on the ground that there was no infringement. Tucker v. Sargent, Fed. Rep. 299. The infringement alleged was in the manufacture and sale of cast-iron butts, samples of which were produced and marked as exhibits. These are described in the opinion of the circuit court, from whose decree this appeal is prosecuted, as follows: 'These butts are colored in this way: The sunken parts are first covered with a black japan, and this coat of blacking is baked in an oven at a temperature not exceeding degrees Fahrenheit. This japanning of the sunken parts is immaterial. It is not really claimed to be a Tucker bronzing. The object probably is to make a marked contrast between the sunken and salient parts of the butt. All but the sunken parts are then ground and subjected to a heat of degrees Fahrenheit, which colors the iron a dark straw color. The ground parts of one of the exhibits are nearly or quite blue. A coat of copal varnish of substantial thickness is then put on and baked in a heat of not over degrees Fahrenheit. This produces a material coating of oxidized varnish upon the surface of the iron, which can be scraped up by a rapidly drawn knife-blade as a shaving rolls up before the knife of a plane. It was not claimed by the defendant that the varnish was not oxidized by the heat. No proof was offered by the plaintiff in regard to the oxidation of the iron during the second heating, and I do no think it of importance. The plaintiff relies upon the uncontradicted fact that by successive applications of heat the iron and varnish were oxidized, and, if an iron surface oxidized by heat with a coating of varnish oxidized by heat necessarily make Tucker bronze, then the defendant infringes the plaintiff's patents.'
8
9
In order to determine the question of infringement it is necessary to consider the state of the art at the date of the patent. It appears from the evidence that one F. W. Brocksieper, in the employ of certain firms and companies, the predecessors of the defendant, between as a foreman in the ornamental department of their work, in the year introduced into the business a mode of treating hat-hooks, coat-hooks, jamb-hooks, sashfasteners, match-boxes, looking-glass frames, and cast-iron horses for saddlers' windows, in the following way: 'We had the castings cast with a facing, so as to come out of the sand very nearly entirely free of sand; then those castings rolled, drilled, and counter-sunk, the highest parts or the prominent parts of the ornaments brightened with sand-paper or emery-paper, brushed clean from dust, then sized and baked. In order to handle them easy,—those hooks,—we had them fastened on a block with a spring, and sized them in quantities as they were ordered; let them stand long enough so that the size would not stick to the fingers, then we put them in pans, or on hooks, and put them in the kiln to bake. The size was a mixture of equal parts of turpentine, copal varnish, and linseed oil, and was applied in a very thin coat, put on with a stiff, fine brush as lightly as we could. The kiln was heated to degrees Fahrenheit. Several batches of hooks of from twelve dozen to twenty-four dozen each, between one hundred dozen and two hundred dozen sash-fasteners, about one hundred looking-glass frames, and horses in 'considerable quantities,' were made and sold. The match-boxes were probably made in larger quantities.'
9
10
It was contended by the plaintiff that this process was not the same as that covered by his patents, for two reasons: (1) Because, as he claimed, the iron was not oxidized by the heat; and (2) because the coating of size was too thick to make genuine Tucker bronze. The circuit court, in its opinion in this case, agreed upon this point with the plaintiff, that the process and article produced were different from those covered by the plaintiff's patents, on the ground that the coating of baked size over the iron was too thick, although it held that Brocksieper's method must have resulted in oxidizing the iron. The inference was that bright cast-iron oxidized and covered with a coat of oxidized oil, varnish, or size might be, but was not necessarily, Tucker bronze. The latter product and process were defined by that court in its opinion as follows: 'Tucker bronze is a new surface of the iron produced by the joint oxidation, or by the successive oxidations of the iron and a film of oil or varnish thereon, by means of high heat, and is not a new coating of oxidized oil or varnish upon the iron. The oil must be applied in such a way that after oxidation there is no substantial covering of baked oil upon the surface of the iron. The surface of the iron is a bronzed surface, because the film of the oil is so thin and is so closely united with the pores of the iron as to be almost a part of it, and does not form a substantial covering like a coat of varnish over the surface of the iron. In Tucker bronze which has been subjected to one heat, the film of oil can with difficulty be scraped off with a knife. When the iron has had two or three successive applications of oil, and has been heated two or three times, the oil comes off by scraping in the form of little flakes or of powder. Tucker's discovery was that bright cast-iron, covered with a thin film of oil, would take on, by the action of high heat, a new surface resembling bronze.'
10
11
It was found from the evidence that the defendant covee d the oxidized surface of iron with an oxidized coat of varnish, doing no more than what Brocksieper did in 1857, except that he did it in two successive stages instead of one, and for that reason there was no infringement. Although there are two patents, one for a process and the other for a product, there is in fact but one invention; and it may be assumed that the new article of manufacture called Tucker bronze is a product which results from the use of the process described in the patent, and not one which may be produced in any other way. So that, whatever likeness may appear between the product of the process described in the patent and the article made by the defendants, their identity is not established unless it is shown that they are made by the same process. The specimens exhibited in the case, as made by Brocksieper, have not the same external appearance as Tucker bronze; they are easily distinguished by inspection; and the process employed by Brocksieper seems to differ from that of the Tucker patents only in respect to the thickness of the sizing of oil or varnish applied upon the surface of the iron, unless the peculiarity of the Tucker bronze can be attributed to the fact that the thin film of oil or varnish was applied upon the surface of the iron before the application of the heat, and not after. For, although the patent contemplates and describes successive applications of heat, yet in each case it is to an oiled surface of iron. On the other hand, the method employed by the defendants consists, first, in subjecting the cleansed surface of the iron to a heat of deg. Fahrenheit, sufficient to change its color by oxidizing, and then applying a coat of copal varnish, and heating again to a point not in excess of deg. Fahrenheit, which, while sufficient to harden and color the varnish by what is called the process of oxidation, yet is not sufficient to oxidize the iron itself. It is difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish by the eye the result of this process from Tucker bronze made according to the patents, but the two processes differ in the particulars pointed out; the effect in Tucker bronze appearing to be produced by the joint oxidation of the iron and the oil, while in the defendants' product the result is attained by successive heatings, first of the iron, and then of the iron and oil, the heat, in the second step of the process, not being sufficient to cause a joint oxidation of the iron and the oil.
11
12
It seems necessarily to follow from this view either that the Tucker patents are void by reason of the anticipation practiced by Brocksieper, or that the patented process and product must be restricted to exactly what is described; that is, to a simultaneous and joint oxidation of the iron and the oil after the application of the oil to a cleansed surface of cast-iron. To that extent the patents may be sustained, but upon that construction they do not include the process and product of the defendants; there is consequently no infringement.
12
13
In opposition to this conclusion it is contended, on the part of the appellants, that the witnesses who testify to the methods employed by Brocksieper in 1857 have confounded in their memory the actual facts in regard to that method as then practiced with processes subsequently employed, and which could have been learned only after the issue of the Tucker patent in 1863; and in corroboration of that criticism upon this evidence it is shown that reproductions of the Brocksieper method, made under the eye of the examiner by a competent expert, during the progress of the taking of the testimony, were not distinguishable in appearance from Tucker bronze made according to the patents. We are not, however, able to adopt that view of the evidence. The fact that by careful workmanship the products are indistinguishable by mere inspection does not establish the identity of the processes, and, as the patent for the product must be limited to an article made by the particular process, thei nquiry must be determined by a comparison between the methods actually employed. As that used by the defendants differs from that described in the patent, just as that employed by Brocksieper does, the process of the defendants cannot be construed as an infringement without at the same time declaring that used by Brocksieper to be an anticipation. The decree of the circuit court must therefore be affirmed.

ROSENBAUM
v.
BAUER, Treasurer, etc.1
SAME
v.
BOARD OF SUP'RS OF CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO.
March 7, 1887.
1
On the thirteenth of October, 1885, Albert S. Rosenbaum brought an action in the superior court of the city and county of San Francisco, in the State of California, against John A. Bauer, treasurer of the city and county of San Francisco. The complaint set forth the issuing of certain bonds, called 'Montgomery Avenue Bonds,' by the board of public works of the city and county of San Francisco, under an act of the legislature of California approved April ) entitled 'An act to open and establish a public street in the city and county of San Francisco, to be called 'Montgomery Avenue,' and to take private lands therefor.' The act provided for the creation by taxation of a fund for the payment of interest on the bonds, and of a sinking fund for their redemption; and enacted that, whenever such treasurer should have in his custody $or more belonging to the sinking fund, he should advertise for proposals for the surrender and redemption of the bonds. The complaint alleged that the plaintiff owned 21 of the bonds, of $each; that the treasurer had in his hands over $belonging to the sinking fund; that the plaintiff had exhibited his bonds to the treasurer, and demanded that he advertise for proposals for the surrender of bonds issued under the act; that he refused so to do; and that no part of such bonds had been paid. The complaint prayed for a judgment that the defendant, 'as treasurer of the city and county of San Francisco, be commanded to advertise for the redemption of Montgomery avenue bonds, as in section eleven of the act hereinabove referred to provided.'

2
Three days afterwards the plaintiff filed a petition for the removal of the suit into the circuit court of the United States for the district of California, on the ground that the plaintiff was a citizen of New York and the defendant a citizen of California. The state court made an order of removal. The record being filed in the federal court, the defendant demurred to the complaint, specifying as a ground of demurrer that the federal court had no jurisdiction of the subject of the action. The case being heard on the demurrer, the court made an order, on the eighteenth of January, 1886, that the cause be remanded to the state court, 'this court having no jurisdiction of this cause in this form.' The plaintiff has brought a writ of error to review that order.
2
3
The same act provided that an annual tax should be levied on the property therein mentioned to raise money to pay the coupons annexed to the bonds, and another annual tax to create a sinking fund for the redemption of the bonds, the taxes to be levied in the manner in which other taxes are levied; that is, by the board of supervisors. The same Rosenbaum, being the owner of twenty-one of the bonds, and of eight matured coupons, of $30 each, attached to each bond, each coupon being for six months' interest, the first of them having matured January 1, 1882, brought an action on the twelfth of December, 1885, in the said superior court of the city and county of San Francisco, against the board of supervisors of the city and county of San Francisco. The complaint set forth that there were no funds in the hands of the treasurer applicable to the payment of any of the coupons, and that the plaintiff had demanded of the board that it levy a tax sufficient to pay the coupons, but it had refused so to do. The complaint prayed for a judgment 'against said board of supervisors, commanding them to levy the tax hereinabove mentioned, and to continue to levy said tax from year to year until all the interest upon said bonds, and said bonds themselves, are fully paid.'

4
On the twenty-first of December, 1885, the plaintiff filed a petition for the removal of this latter suit into the circuit court of the United States for the district of California, on the ground of diversity of citizenship in the parties. The state court made an order of removal. The defendant made a motion in the federal court to remand the case to the state court on the ground of want of jurisdiction by the federal court 'of the subject-matter contained in the complaint.' On the twenty-fourth of May, 1886, the court made an order granting the motion, and the plaintiff has brought a writ of error to review that order.
4
5
The circuit court, in remanding the cause, () proceeded on these grounds: (1) That it had always been held by this court that the circuit courts had no jurisdiction to award a mandamus except as ancillary to some other proceeding establishing a demand, and reducing it to judgment, the mandamus being in the nature of process for executing the judgment; (2) that a proceeding for a mandamus was not a suit of a civil nature, within the meaning of any provision of the act of March ) and was not removable under it.
5
6
Prior to the act of it was well settled that the circuit courts had no jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus in a case like the present.
6
7
In McIntire v. Wood, (in it was held that a circuit court had no power to issue a mandamus to the register of a land-office of the United States, commanding him to grant a final certificate of purchase to the plaintiff for lands to which he supposed himself entitled under the laws of the United States. In that case the plaintiff's alleged right to a certificate of purchase was claimed under the laws of the United States, but this court, speaking by Mr. Justice JOHNSON, said that the power of the circuit courts to issue the writ was confined by section 14 of the judiciay act of ) to those cases in which it might be necessary to the exercise of their jurisdiction. This provision of section 14 appears now in section of the Revised Statutes in these words: 'Sec. The supreme court and the circuit and district courts shall have power to issue writs of scire facias. They shall also have power to issue all writs not specifically provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.'
7
8
In McClung v. Silliman, (in a mandamus was applied for in a circuit court of the United States to compel the register of a land-office of the United States to issue papers to show the pre-emptive interest of the plaintiff in certain land. The writ was refused. In this court the case was sought to be distinguished from McIntire v. Wood, on the ground that the parties were citizens of different states. But the court, speaking again by Mr. Justice JOHNSON, said that no just inference was to be drawn from the decision in McIntire v. Wood in favor of a case in which the circuit court was vested with jurisdiction by citizenship under section 11 of the act of And then, in answer to the argument that, as the parties were citizens of different states, and competent to sue under section 11, the circuit court was, by section 14, vested with power to issue the writ as one 'necessary for the exercise of its jurisdiction,' the court said: 'It cannot be denied that the exercise of this power is necessary to the exercise of jurisdiction in the court below; but why is it necessary? Not because that court possesses jurisdiction, but because it does not possess it. It must exercise this power, and compel the emanation of the legal document, or the execution of the legal act by the register of the land-office, or the party cannot sue. The fourteenth section of the act under consideration could only have been intended to vest the power now contended for in cases where the jurisdiction already exists, and not where it is to be courted or acquired by menas of the writ proposed to be sued out.'
8
9
Consistently with the views in those cases, this court, in Riggs v. Johnson Co., (in held that a circuit court had power to issue a mandamus to officers of a county, commanding them to levy a tax to pay a judgment rendered in that court against the county for interest on bonds issued by the county, where a statute of the state under which the bonds were issued had made such levy obligatory on the county. This ruling has been repeatedly followed since, and rests on the view that the issue of the mandamus is an award of execution on the judgment, and is a proceeding necessary to complete the jurisdiction exercised by rendering the judgment.
9
10
In many cases adjudged in this court since McIntire v. Wood, that case has been referred to as settling the law on the point to which it relates; as in The Secretary v. McGarrahan, Bath Co. v. Amy, and Heine v. Levee Com'rs. 
10
11
In Both Co. v. Amy, (in ) ubi supra, the holder of bonds issued by a county in Kentucky applied to the circuit court of the United States for a mandamus to compel the county court to levy a tax to pay the interest on the bonds, on the ground that a statute of the state required the county court to do so. No judgment had been obtained for the interest. In Kentucky such a proceeding could have been maintained in a court of the state without a prior judgment, and would have been there treated as a suit of a civil nature at common law, and not a mere incident to another suit. The circuit court awarded the mandamus, but this court reversed the judgment; holding that it was doubtful whether the writ of mandamus was intended to be embraced in the grant of power in the eleventh section of the judiciarya ct of to the circuit courts, to take cognizance of suits of a civil nature at common law, where the diversity of citizenship there specified existed; but that the special provision of the fourteenth section of the act, while, no doubt, including mandamus under the term 'other writs,' indicated that the power to grant that writ generally was not understood to be covered by the eleventh section. Citing the prior cases, the court said: 'The writ cannot be used to confer a jurisdiction which the circuit court would not have without it. It is authorized only when ancillary to a jurisdiction already acquired.'
11
12
The same doctrine was applied in Graham v. Norton, (in where a circuit court of the United States had affirmed the action of a district court in granting a mandamus to compel a state auditor to issue certificates as to the amount of illegal taxes paid by the applicant, the issuing of such certificates being provided for by a statute of the state. This court held that neither the circuit court nor the district court had jurisdiction to issue the writ.
12
13
The same principles have been asserted by this court in cases arising since the act of March 3, 1875; an in County of Greene v. Daniel, in U. S. v. Schurz, Id. in Davenport v. County of Dodge, and in Louisiana v. Jumel, Sup. Ct. Rep. 
13
14
But now it is contended for the plaintiff in error that the circuit court can obtain jurisdiction of these cases by their removal under section 2 of the act of It was evidently thought that the circuit court would have no original cognizance of them, if commenced in that court, for they were not brought in that court, although in the petition for removal in each proceeding the plaintiff states that he was a citizen of New York when it was commenced, and in the petition for removal in the first proceeding he states that Bauer was at its commencement a citizen of California, the defendant in the second proceeding being, when it was brought, a municipal corporation of California. The proceedings were evidently instituted with the purpose of removing them, for the petitions for removal were severally filed by the plaintiff three days and ten days after process was served on the defendant, and nothing was done in the state court but to file a complaint, and to serve a summons, and to take proceedings for a removal.
14
15
To maintain the jurisdiction by removal, it is contended that that jurisdiction does not depend on the original jurisdiction of the circuit court; that the former may exist without the latter; and that in the present case it does exist.
15
16
The only possible ground of jurisdiction in the present cases is diversity of citizenship; for the right of action claimed does not arise under the constitution or a law or treaty of the United States. It exists, if at all, under a statute of the state. The state is not alleged to have passed any law impairing the obligation of any contract of which the plaintiff claims the benefit, or to have deprived him of any right secured to him by the constitution of the United States. In respect to jurisdiction by citizenship, as applicable to this case, section 1 of the act of in regard to original jurisdiction, and section 2, in regard to jurisdiction by removal, describe the subject-matter of the suit in terms which are the same legally. In section 1 the suit of which 'original cognizance' is given is a suit of a civil nature, at common law or in equity,' where the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of costs, the sum or value of $ and 'in which there shall be a controversy between citizens of different states.' In section 2 the language is identical, except that the suit is to be a suit 'of a civil nature, at law or in euqity.' In section 11 of the act of the original cognizance given to the circuit court was of 'all suits of a civil nature, at o mmon law or in equity,' where the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of costs, the sum or value of $ and 'the suit is between a citizen of the state where the suit is brought and a citizen of another state.' In section 12 of that act, jurisdiction by removal was given to the circuit courts of a like suit. Now, if, as has always been held, 'original cognizance,' under section 11 of the act of did not exist, of proceedings like those before us, founded on citizenship, it must necessarily follow that original cognizance cannot exist, under section 1 of the act of of such a proceeding, founded on citizenship. If so, it is impossible to see how, with legally identical language in section 2 with that in section 1, jurisdiction by removal can exist, under section 2 of the act of of proceedings like those before us, founded on citizenship. This view is entirely aside from the principle which has controlled in some cases, where a restriction as to original jurisdiction, contained in other provisions of section 11 of the act of did not exist in section 12 of that act in regard to jurisdiction by removal, or in other removal statutes. Of that character was the restriction in section 11 on the right of an assignee of a chose in action to sue if the suit could not have been prosecuted in the court had the assignment not been made; as illustrated by the cases cited by the plaintiff in error of City of Lexington v. Butler, and Claflin v. Commonwealth Ins. Co., Sup. Ct. Rep. 
16
17
In Gaines v. Fuentes, 92 U. S. 10, an application for removal was sustained under the local prejudice act of March ) of a suit to annul a will, on the ground that the act, in authorizing the removal, invested the federal court by that fact with all needed jurisdiction to adjudicate the case. But that case was not one of a mandamus, to which the implied restriction of the statute in respect to that writ was applicable. The same remark may be made as to Boom Co. v. Patterson, where the removal proceeding was one to condemn lands for the use of a boom company; and as to Hess v. Reynolds, Sup. Ct. Rep. where the removal was of a proceeding in a probate court to obtain payment of a claim against the estate of a deceased person; and as to Bliven v. New England Screw Co., Blatchf. 111, and Barney v. Globe Bank, Blatchf. 107, where foreign corporations successfully maintained jurisdiction by removal in ordinary suits, although they could not have been compulsorily brought into the circuit court by original process.
17
18
As this court, while sections 11 and 12 of the act of were in force, and section 14 of that act was also in force, always held, even where the requisite diversity of citizenship existed, that the restriction of section 14 operated to prevent original cognizance by a circuit court, under section 11, of a proceeding by mandamus not necessary for the exercise of a jurisdiction which had previously otherwise attached, so, with sections 1 and 2 of the act of in force at the same time with section of the Revised Statutes, the restriction of section must operate to prevent cognizance by removal, by a circuit court, under section 2 of the act of even where the requisite diversity of citizenship exists, of a like proceeding by mandamus. As was said by this court, speaking by Mr. Justice MILLER, in Hess v. Reynolds, Sup. Ct. Rep. the language of the repealing clause of the act of is 'that all acts and parts of acts in conflict with the provisions of this act are hereby repealed,' and the statute to be repealed must be in conflict with the act of or that effect does not follow. There is nothing in section 2, or any other part of the act of which is in conflict with, or has the effect to abolish, the restriction of section just as there was nothing ins ection 11, or section 12, or any other part, of the act of which was in conflict with, or had the effect to abolish, the restriction of section 14 of that act.
18
19
These cases fall directly within the provision of section 5 of the act of that if, in any suit removed from a state court to a circuit court of the United States, it shall appear to the satisfaction of said circuit court, at any time after such suit has been brought or removed thereto, that such suit does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly 'within the jurisdiction' of said circuit court, the said circuit court shall proceed no further therein, but shall dismiss the suit, or remand it to the court from which it was removed, as justice may require. What is meant by the expression 'within the jurisdiction?' It means, 'within the judicial cognizance,' within the capacity to determine the merits of the dispute or controversy, and to grant the relief asked for. The provision does not give countenance to the idea that the suit or proceeding is to be retained in the circuit court till brought to a formal adjudication on the merits, when, at that ultimate stage, the court must say that the case is not within its jurisdiction, after the party successfully challenging the jurisdiction has been harassed by expense and injured by delay. But it means what it says: that the dismissal or remanding 'shall' be made whenever, 'at any time' after the suit is brought or removed to the circuit court, it shall appear to the satisfaction of that court that there is, really and substantially, no dispute or controversy of which it has jurisdiction, in the sense above pointed out; the right to have a review by this court of the order dismissing or remanding the suit being given to the aggrieved party at once, instead of his being compelled to await the making of such an order at the end of a full and formal hearing or trial, on issues and proofs, on the merits alleged on either side. Orders affirmed.
19
20
Mr. Justice HARLAN and Mr. Justice MATTHEWS agree with me in dissenting from the judgment of the court in this case. It is a constitutional right of the citizens of the several states having controversies with the citizens of other states to have a national forum in which such controversies may be litigated. It was one of the declared purposes of the constitution that the judicial power of the United States should extend to certain cases enumerated, one of which was 'to controversies between citizens of different states;' and it was declared that this power should be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as the congress might from time to time ordain and establish,—thus making it the duty of congress to establish such tribunals. If congress fails in this constitutional duty, the citizens have no redress but the ballot-box. But congress has not failed. It has established the requisite tribunals, and has invested them with the powers necessary to give the citizens their constitutional rights; or, if it has failed in any respect, either with regard to persons or causes, we think it has not failed in respect to the class of cases to which the present belong.
20
21
Congress, by the act of March 3, 1875, passed to determine the jurisdiction of the circuit courts, has declared that they shall have original cognizance, concurrent with the courts of the several states, among other things, of all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity, involving over $ in which there shall be a controversy between citizens of different states; and that any such suit, brought in any state court, may be removed by either party into the circuit court for the proper district. This jurisdiction should be liberally construed so as to give full effect, as far as may be, to the constitutional right, as presumably within the intent of congress. The terms 'suits at common law and in equity,' or 'suits at law and in equity,' (which is the same thing,) are, in themselves, of the most general character and of the broadest signification; and this court ought not, by its decisions, to restrict their application. It is not meant by the expression 'suits at common law' to confine the jurisdiction of the circuit courts to the old technical actions of trespass, trover, trespass on the case, debt, detinue, assumpsit, etc., but it extends to and includes any form of proceeding of a civil nature in which a legal right cognizable by the courts of common law is sought to be judicially enforced, by whatever name, under the new-fangled nomenclature adopted by the different states, the proceeding may be called. Suits at law and equity include every form of proceeding except those peculiar to admiralty, ecclesiastical or probate, and military jurisdictions. And even in matters savoring of ecclesiastical process, after an issue has been formed between definite parties, we have held that the controversy came under the head of a suit at law. Gaines v. Fuentes, 92 U. S. 17; Hess v. Reynolds, Sup. Ct. Rep. The broad terms used in the law were purposely employed, as it seems to us, to make the jurisdiction complete to the full extent which the constitution intended it should have. It is true that in one or two cases we have intimated a distinction between the extent of jurisdiction given in the first and that given in the second sections of the act of but that distinction, if well founded, does not affect the present case, since they arise under the second section, which has been supposed to be the broader of the two, and, in any event, the ground of distinction is not here involved.
21
22
Now, a mandamus, which was originally a prerogative writ only, has come to be in many cases, and in most states, a private suit, brought for the purpose of enforcing a private right. This is true in the two cases now before us. The appellant has a money demand against the city and county of San Francisco, and is seeking to collect it in the usual way in which such demands are collectible by the law of procedure of California. The mandamus which he seeks is the mere process for commencing his action, and is a proper process suited to his case. The city and county of San Francisco can set up any defenses to the action in this form which it could do in the ordinary action of debt or upon contract. It is essentially a civil suit at law, no matter by what name it is called,—certainly as much so as were the proceedings in Gaines v. Fuentes, Hess v. Reynolds, already cited, and in Boom Co. v. Patterson, where there was an issue to ascertain the value of property taken by virtue of eminent domain. In Davies v. Corbin, Sup. Ct. Rep. 4, we sustained a writ of error from this court to the circuit court on a judgment in a proceeding for mandamus to carry into effect a judgment for a debt. The chief justice there said: 'While the writ of mandamus, in cases like this, partakes of the nature of an execution to enforce the collection of a judgment, it can only be got by instituting an independent suit for that purpose. There must be—First, a showing by the relator in support of his right to the writ; and, second, process to bring in the adverse party whose action is to be coerced, to show cause, if he can, against it. If he appears and presents a defense, the showings of the parties make up the pleadings in the cause, and any issue of law or fact that may be raised must be judicially determined by the court before the writ can go out. Such a determination is, under the circumstances, a judgment in a civil action brought to secure a right; that is to say, process to enforce a judgment. Such a judgment is, in our opinion, a final judgment in a civil action, within the meanin of that term as used in the statutes regulating writs of error to this court.'
22
23
In the jurisprudence of California it has frequently been held that a mandams is a civil action. It is only necessary to refer to the cases to show that this point is beyond all dispute. Perry v. Ames, Cariaga v. Dryden, Courtwright v. Bear River, etc., Co., Id. Knowles v. Yates, 31 Cal. 90; People v. Kern Co., People v. Thompson, Pac. Rep. 
23
24
But it is urged that the power given to the circuit courts of the United States to issue writs of mandamus is limited by act of congress to certain special cases, namely, only where they may be necessary for the exercise of their ordinary jurisdiction, (Rev. St. § ) and that, according to the decisions of this court in suits for the collection of money, the writ can only be used as ancillary to an execution after a judgment has been obtained in an ordinary suit. It is sufficient to say that all of these decisions, except two, relate to the law as it was before the passage of the act of That act, as we have seen, is expressed in general terms without any qualification as to the writs or process which shall be employed, and repeals any restraining effect of section of the Revised Statutes, if in conflict with it. The two cases to which we have referred as decided since the act are County of Greene v. Daniel, and Davenport v. County of Dodge, But the point decided in these cases was that, although the state law gave the remedy of mandamus to compel the levy of taxes for the payment of bonds, an ordinary action might nevertheless be brought on the bonds for the purpose of obtaining a judgment. They do not decide, whatever dicta may appear to have been made, that mandamus might not have been brought originally.
24
25
The inference drawn from section Rev. St., is that, as it grants power to this court and the circuit courts 'to issue all writs not specifically provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the usages and principles of law,' (which is rightly supposed to include the writ of mandamus,) it must be construed as denying the power to issue that writ in any other case. This conclusion might be admissible if it is restrained to the instance of the particular writ of mandamus which alone was in contemplation; that is, the prerogative writ of mandamus as known to the practice of the king's bench in England. The object of this section of the statute was to give the courts of the United States the power to issue such a writ when necessary in the exercise of a jurisdiction in which the use of such a writ was conformable to law. But the section had no reference to mandamus as a form of civil action, as it has become in modern times, having a definite purpose and scope, and as distinct in its use, for the purpose of enforcing private rights of a particular description, as are the forms of actions known to the common law, such as assumpsit, debt, or trespass. Viewed as a civil action, authorized by the laws of the state in which the suit is brought, the jurisdiction of the circuit courts is established by section 1 of the act of which embraces 'all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity, where the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of costs, the sum or value of five hundred dollars, * * * in which there shall be a controversy between citizens of different states.' If there be such a suit, in which, by the law of the state, the form of proceeding is required to be in mandamus, section Rev. St., applies, which requires that 'the practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding in civil cases, other than equity and admiralty cases, in the circuit and district courts, shall conform, as near as may be, to the practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding existing at the time in like causes in the courts of record of the state within which such circuit or district courts are hel, any rule of court to the contrary notwithstanding.' Effect may be given in the present case to this provision of the statute without running counter to section The fallacy of the argument against the jurisdiction of the circuit court, in such cases, is in construing section as an exception out of the general grant of jurisdiction to that court over all suits in which the controversy is between citizens of different states; whereas it is a general grant of power to issue all writs necessary to the exercise of their jurisdiction,—a power which would probably have been implied without an express grant.
25
26
In our judgment the case ought not to have been remanded, and the judgments of the circuit court remanding the same should be reversed.

To this the counsel for the defendants objected on two grounds: (1) That, the warrant to Lewis Walker appearing to be dated November 26, 1793, it was not competent to prove payment of the purchase money by Ruston on June 14, 1794; and, (2) that, if any title whatever accrued to Ruston, it would be but a resulting trust, as the plaintiffs did not propose to follow it with any evidence showing a conveyance of the legal title to Ruston or those elaiming under him, or any possession of the land by him or them, or the bringing of any action of ejectment to recover it within twenty-one years from the date of the warrant. The objections were overruled, and an exception taken. The plaintiffs also put in evidence a copy of the warrant to Lewis Walker, dated the twenty-sixth of November, acres adjoining Dr. Thomas Ruston's other lands; and a copy of a survey for Lewis Walker, dated the twenty-second of October, 1794, in pursuance of the warrant, containing acres. The survey was followed by a certified copy of the return made by William Gray, deputy surveyor, into the land-office showing that on February 23, 1795, he returned to the land-office the Lewis Walker survey for acres. Warrants and surveys of five other tracts were introduced in evidence in connection with the warrant and survey of the Lewis Walker tract, being the same tracts of land which are mentioned in the application and purchase voucher. The plaintiffs then traced title into Nicholas Le Favre by virtue of a judgment against Thomas Ruston in 1796, and levy on lands of the defendant Ruston, including the Lewis Walker tract, and a sale and conveyance of the same to Le Favre by a marshal's deed. Nicholas Le Favre having died, his will was admitted to probate on the twelfth of August, 1815, on which day William R. Smith took out letters of administration with the will annexed. A schedule attached to the will of the testator, of his lands in Pennsylvania, included the Lewis Walker tract for acres. In William R. Smith, the administrator, with the will annexed of Nicholas Le Favre, petitioned the orphans' court of Philadelphia for an order to sell real estate to pay the debts of the decedent. By further proceedings upon said application in the orphans' court of Northumberland county, where a portion of the lands of Le Favre were located, a decree of sale was obtained, and the Lewis Walker tract, among others, was sold on the ninth of May, 1837, to Joseph Brobst, as the property of Nicholas Le Favre. A deed was made to Brobst for the land, and the sale confirmed in Northumberland county, where the lands were located. By sundry mesne conveyances the title of Brobst was vested in the plaintiffs below. There was evidence tending to show that the lands in controversy were wild and unimproved until when the parties through whom the plaintiffs claim title took actual possession thereof, and improved the same by the erection of a house and saw-mill, and put to work a corps of men for the purpose of proving the coal veins. These operations and expenditures were continued for a period of about 18 months, at a cost of between $ when the work was suspended as not being profitable; but possession was maintained through agents and tenants until when the defendants took forcible possession, claiming title. The defendants below objected to the admission in evidence of the records from the orphans' court of Philadelphia, showing the proceedings resulting in the sale of the lands of Nicholas Le Favre to Joseph Brobst, on the ground that the debts of the decedent, as set forth in the petition of the administrator, to pay which the order of sale issued, were barred by the statute of lm itations and their lien extinguished, by reason of which it was claimed that the orphans' court had no jurisdicton to grant the order. The objection was overruled, and an exception taken.

13
There was also evidence introduced by the plaintiffs, which was objected to, tending to show payment of taxes by those under whom the plaintiffs claim. The defendants below offered in evidence on their part an application of Daniel Reese, Lewis Walker, and others, filed in the land-office November 26, 1793, indorsed 'Ent'd by Wm. Lane for Daniel Rees;' also the warrant from the commonwealth to Lewis Walker for acres, dated November 26, 1793; also the survey to Lewis Walker, made October 22, 1794, in pursuance of the warrant of November 26, 1793, describing the tract in dispute; and then offered a certified copy of a patent from the common wealth of Pennsylvania to Peter Grahl, dated April 12, 1797, for the same tract, which patent contained a recital to the effect that Lewis Walker, by deed dated November 27, 1793, had conveyed the said tract with the appurtenances to Peter Grahl. Counsel for the plaintiffs below objected to the introduction in evidence of this patent on the ground that Dr. Ruston held a prior title to the land from the commonwealth. This objection was sustained, the court refusing to allow the patent to be read to the jury, to which the defendants excepted. The defendants below then renewed the offer of the patent to Peter Grahl for the land in dispute, in connection with an offer to prove a connected chain of title from Peter Grahl to themselves, to be followed by proof that they took actual possession of the land in dispute in 1875, paid taxes by redeeming the land from tax sales, made improvements, expended large sums of money in opening coal mines, and have ever since held actual possession of the land; and also that Nicholas Le Favre, who purchased the alleged title of Dr. Ruston at marshal's sale on October 11, 1803, received notice in Octover, of the title of Peter Grahl under the patent to him, and that the plaintiffs below, when they purchased at sheriff's sale in 1872, received notice of the same facts. This offer was rejected, and an exception duly taken.
13
14
The court below also refused to allow the defendants to read in evidence certain parts of the return of William Gray, deputy surveyor, to the commissioners of Northumberland county, made in 1796, other parts of which had been read by the plaintiffs below, in order to show that the taxes paid by Dr. Ruston on the lands, which he did in fact own in the same county, and paid into the same office during the same time, were paid to or by a different person than were the taxes paid on the land in dispute; and to show that there was another tract surveyed by the commonwealth in the same locality, and in the same county, in the name of Lewis Walker, as warrantee, which was claimed by Dr. Ruston. These offers were also rejected by the court, to which ruling the defendants excepted.
14
15
The court below charged the jury, among other things, as follows: 'The plaintiffs put in evidence a certified copy of an ancient paper, dated November 26, 1793, on file in the land-office, designated as old purchase voucher No. and, in connection therewith, a certified copy of an entry, under date of June 14, 1794, from the old purchase blotter in the land office. These documents were offered to show, and they are evidence tending to show, that Dr. Thomas Ruston was the owner of the Lewis Walker warrant, and paid to the commonwealth the purchase money for said tract of land.' And also: 'The plaintiffs have shown that, by sundry mesne conveyances, the title which Nicholas Le Favre thus acquired became vested in them prior to the bringing of this action. In connection with their paper title the plaintiffs gave evidence tending to show that for many years they, and those under whom they claim, asserted title to the land, and paid taxes thereon, without any hostile claim being set up against them until the year when the defendants took possession. If the evidence on the part of the plaintiffs is believed by the jury, it makes out a prima facie case for the plaintiffs, and they are entitled to your verdict upon this branch of their title.' To these charges the defendants excepted. These several rulings of the court are now assigned for error.

In the case of Sims v. Irvine, which was an ejectment for land ying in Pennsylvania, decided by this court in 1799, it was said that, in that state, 'payment, or, as in this case, consideration, passed, and a survey, though unaccompanied by a patent, gave a legal right of entry which is sufficient in ejectment. Why they have been adjudged to give such right, whether from a defect of chancery powers, or for other reasons of policy or justice, is not now material. The right once having become an established legal right, and having incorporated itself as such with property and tenures, it remains a legal right, notwithstanding any new distribution of judicial powers, and must be regarded by the common-law courts of the United States in Pennsylvania as a rule of decision.'
16
17
The case of Evans v. Patterson, decided in 1886, was similar. In that case Mr. Justice GRIER, delivering the opinion of the court, said, (page ) 'The case cannot be made intelligible without a brief notice of the very peculiar land law of Pennsylvania. The proprietors of the province, in the beginning, allowed no one man to locate and survey more than three hundred acres. To evade this rule in after times, it was the custom for speculators in land to make application in the names of third persons, and, having obtained a warrant, to take from them what was called a 'deed poll,' or a brief conveyance of their inchoate equitable claim. Pennsylvania, until of late years, had no courts of equity. Hence, in an action of ejectment, the plaintiff might recover without showing a legal title. If he had a prior inchoate or equitable title, either as trustee or cestui que trust, he might recover. The courts treated the applicant or warrantee as trustee for the party who paid the purchase money, or paid even the surveying fees; for the purchase money, under the location or application system, was not paid at the time, and sometimes never. When the state succeeded to the title of the proprietors, the application system was abandoned, and warrants were granted on payment of the purchase money for the number of acres for which his warrant called. Hence, where the claimant of the warrant was unable to show his deed poll, he might recover by showing that he paid the purchase money; that the warrantee whose name was used was therefore trustee for him. And an ejectment might also be maintained in the name of the warrantee, although he had no beneficial interest in the land, and had no knowledge of the institution of the suit. See Campbell v. Galbreath, 1 Watts, 78, and also Ross v. Barker, which was decided on the title now in question.' It is equally well established that the action of ejectment may be maintained upon a warrant and survey by the owner who paid the purchase money, without any conveyance from the person in whose name the application was made and the warrant issued. Brown v. Galloway, Pet. C. C. Willink v. Miles, Pet. C. C. 
17
18
It was said by Mr. Justice WASHINGTON, in Huidekoper v. Burrus, that 'the person whose name appears on the warrant is considered as merely a nominal grantee, and a trustee for the person who pays for the warrant and has it executed;' stating, as a matter of fact in the history of the practice of the state, that, 'whenever one person takes out many warrants, he borrows the names of certain persons, no matter who they are.' See, also, Griffith v. Tunckhouser, Pet. C. C. James v. Gordon, Copley v. Riddle, This doctrine is established as h e law of Pennsylvania by many decisions of the supreme court of that state.
18
19
In Duer v. Boyd, that court said: 'For above fifty years past lands held by warrant and survey, without patents, have been considered as the legal estate in England, subject to the liens of judgment, curtesy, dower, and other incidents of real property.'
19
20
In Maclay v. Work, it is said: 'An estate held by warrant and survey, or other imperfect title, without patent, is of a singular nature. In many, and indeed in most, respects it is considered as a legal estate against all persons but the commonwealth. It is subject to the same laws of descent, devise, and conveyance as the legal estate. Tenancy by the courtesy and in dower are attached to it. An ejectment may be supported on it.'
20
21
And in Gingrich v. Foltz, 19 Pa. St. 40, it is said: 'In Pennsylvania a warrant and survey, attended with payment of the purchase money, is to be considered, as against all but the commonwealth, in the same light as the legal estate in England, and it is not to be distinguished, as to the mode of conveying, entailing, and barring entails, from estates strictly legal. * * * If the warrant, survey, and payment of the purchase money constitute a legal title, it is impossible to comprehend how the commonwealth can, by any act whatever, after she has parted with that title, prejudice, much less extinguish, it.'
21
22
Upon this view of the law, it appears from the record that the plaintiffs below proved a legal title to the Lewis Walker tract in controversy in Dr. Thomas Ruston. The old purchase voucher No. offered in evidence, shows that the purchase money for the six tracts described was paid by one person; and the receipt, being a copy from the old purchase blotter, also No. to correspond, shows that the owner of the warrants, by virtue of the payment of the purchase money, was Dr. Ruston. Counsel for the plaintiffs in error seek to read the abbreviations in that extract from the old purchase blotter as showing that the purchase money had not been paid in full; but we think it otherwise sufficiently appears, not only on the face of the receipt itself, but also from the statement on the margin of the old purchase voucher, that a general receipt had been given, corroborated by the fact that the warrants were actually issued. A point is made on behalf of the plaintiffs in error that the issue of the warrant cannot be considered as evidence of the payment of the purchase money, because it is dated prior to the date of the receipt taken from the old purchase blotter, the warrant being dated the twenty-sixth of November, 1793, and the receipt the fourteenth of June, 1794. This, however, is explained by the practice, known to have existed, that while a warrant was never issued except after the payment of the purchase money, yet it was dated as of the date of the entry in the old purchase voucher, which was the authority given to the surveyor to locate the land, the warrant being subsequently issued so as to relate back to that date.
22
23
In Brown v. Galloway, Pet. C. C. Mr. Justice WASHINGTON said: 'A warrant for land is, according to long and uniform practice, dated on the day the application is made for the land, although it is retained in the office until the purchase money is paid, when, and not before, it issues to the party.' To the same effect is Lewis v. Meredith, 3 Wash. C. C. 81.
23
24
The competency and value of the two documents from the old purchase voucher and the old purchase blotter, to prove the fact of the payment of the purchase money, and by whom it was paid, are stated by the supreme court of Pennsylvania, in the case of Oliphant v. Ferren, 1 Watts, 57. It is there said that these entries were made by John Keble, who was chief clerk in the receiver general's office. Prior to proof of the payment of the purchase money was made by the production of the original receipt, or the e stimony of Keble during his life-time, and, after his death, proof of his handwriting and entry in these books. In however, by a statute passed during that year, the books themselves, and copies from them, were made prima facie evidence. The matter is thus explained by Judge Huston in his essay on the History and Nature of Original Titles to Land in the Province and State of Pennsylvania, Charles Huston, p. 'Even on warrants where money was paid, there was sometimes difficulty as to who was the owner. The warrant, being in a name different from that of the claimant on its face, proved nothing. Where the owner, when he took out his warrant, took a receipt for his purchase money, and preserved it, this often decided the question of ownership, and it became usual for a plaintiff to recover on such a receipt, without producing any conveyance from the person whose name was used in the warrant. But where the owner either took no receipt, or it was lost or mislaid, the ownership must be proved by other means. The common books of the land-office charged the warrantee with the land, and credited him with the payment of the money. When it became necessary to pay the money before you got the warrant, and while John Keble was chief clerk in the receiver general's office, he kept an account of who paid the money on every warrant sealed in that office. The entry, however, is not easily understood, except by those acquainted with the office. Every application was numbered successively, as they were handed in, from one up to near twenty thousand. Some of these applications were for a single tract, and many for more than one hundred; the last written on a single sheet of paper, or several sheets attached together. On each of these was marked the date when filed, and the name of the man who paid the money always appeared. When you applied for a warrant, there were marks by which you could refer to and find the application; and from the application, and its number and date, you could find the entry in John Keble's blotter, and there see who paid the purchase money. The right to many tracts has been ascertained by searching as here mentioned; and a copy of that blotter, under seal of office, is now evidence in a court of justice, by a particular act of assembly. So careful was John Keble that, if the person who paid the money told him by whom it was sent, that also appeared in the blotter.' Vide, also, Campbell v. Galbreath, 1 Watts, 70.
24
25
There is nothing in the case of Strimpfler v. Roberts, cited and relied upon by the plaintiffs in error, inconsistent with the foregoing. In that case the plaintiffs in the ejectment were permitted to prove that Benson, under whom they claimed, had paid the purchase money, and they did so by the blotters, vouchers, etc., as in the present instance; and it was admitted and decided in that case that such proof established a prima facie title in them, but one, however, which might be overcome by proof of the fact that Benson, who appeared to have paid the purchase money, had done so, not on his own behalf, but as agent for others; and that fact being made to appear, it was held that a patent issued to the assignee of the warrantee conveyed a superior legal title. The conclusion is summed up by Chief Justice BLACK, in the opinion of the court, as follows, (page ) 'That, where a warrant is issued to one person, and the purchase money is paid by another, and the patent is afterwards taken out by the nominal warrantee, the right of him who paid the purchase money is gone, unless he takes possession of the land, or brings ejectment to recover it within twenty-one years from the date of the warrant; and after that lapse of time he cannot recover, no matter how clearly he may be able to prove that the legal owner was in the beginning a trustee for him. * * * When I say that the suit must be brought within twenty-one years from the date of the warrant, I speak of a case like the present n e, in which the alleged trust is prove by the naked and solitary fact of the payment of purchase money. Where the cestui que trust has superintended the survey, and paid the officer's fees, or exercised otehr acts of ownership over the land, the presumption in favor of the trustee would perhaps not begin to arise until he did some act of hostility, such as selling his title, or taking out a patent to himself.'
25
26
In the present case, the evidence admitted was held to establish a prima facie legal title in Dr. Thomas Ruston. It was sufficient to establish that he paid the purchase money, and the other proof in the case showed that he and those who claimed under him exercised acts of ownership over the property until their possession was disturbed violently by the defendants below, in the year The defendants were able to offer nothing in opposition to this, except the patent under which there had been no claim of title for more than 75 years, and which was not connected by any proof, other than its own recitals, with the warrant and survey.
26
27
In Glass v. Gilbert, it was decided that the doctrine of Strimpfier v. Roberts, and McBarron v. Glass, that a trust will not be sustained between the warrantee and one who has paid the purchase money after 21 years, without possession taken by the claimant, etc., does not apply to a stranger to the title of the warrantee. If 21 years elapse before interference by a junior survey, the presumption in favor of the first, although a chamber survey, becomes absolute.
27
28
It follows from the foregoing that the evidence introduced by the plaintiffs below was competent and sufficient to establish in Dr. Ruston a legal title to the lands in question.
28
29
The next assignment of error is founded upon the objection made to the admission of the record and proceedings in the orphans' court of Philadelphia county, resulting in the sale of the title of Nicholas Le Favre to the Lewis Walker tract to Joseph Brobst, by the deed of May 9, 1837. This objection was that it appeared from the face of the petition for the sale of the real estate of the decedent that the debts, to pay which it was alleged that the sale was necessary, were barred by the statute of limitations, and that, as a consequence, the orphans' court had no jurisdiction to make the order of sale. The course of proceeding taken in the present case, as shown by the transcript, was (1) a petition to the orphans' court of Philadelphia for authority to sell, that being the court which had jurisdiction of the accounts of the executor; (2) a petition to the orphans' court of Northumberland county, in which the land was situated, an order of sale granted thereon, and sale made, and, as required by the express provisions of the statute of then in force, the return of the sale made to and confirmed by the same court sitting in the county where the land is situated. It is scarcely necessary to cite authority in support of the proposition that the orders, judgments, and decrees of the orphans' court, in a case where it had jurisdiction of the subject-matter, cannot be impeached collaterally. Much less is it so in the present case, because the statute of Pennsylvania of March 29, (2 Brightley's Purd. Dig. p. ) provides as follows: 'The orphans' court is hereby declared to be a court of record, with all the qualities and incidents of a court of record at common law. Its proceedings and decrees in all matters within its jurisdiction shall not be reversed or avoided collaterally in any other court; but they shall be liable to reversal or modification or alteration on appeal to the supreme court, as hereinafter directed.' Iddings v. Cairns, 2 Grant, Cas. 88; Riland v. Eckert. 
29
30
In Dresher v. Allentown Water Co., Mr. Justice STRONG said: 'Orphans' court decrees are doubtless conclusive. They cannot be impeached collaterally'
30
31
The next assignment of error is founded upon the refusal of the court to admit as evidence the certified copy of the patent from the commonwealth of Pennsylvania to Peter Grahl, dated April 12, 1797, with a recital therein of the fact that Lewis Walker, by deed dated November 27, 1793, had conveyed the tract in question to Peter Grahl. The legal title of Thomas Ruston to the premises in dispute, established by the warrant and survey and payment of the purchase money, was perfected by the return made by the deputy surveyor into the land-office on February 23, 1795. According to the doctrine established by the authorities already cited, it was not competent for the commonwealth of Pennsylvania to affect that title by a subsequent patent to a stranger. Peter Grahl, the patentee, was not connected with the title under the warrant and survey, otherwise than by the recital contained in the patent itself, that the tract had been previously conveyed to him by Lewis Walker. Clearly that recital was not evidence against the plaintiffs, for, if the patent could not take effect against them without it, it could not give any effect to that recital. Their right had already vested prior to the existence of the patent, and the grant to them could not be affected by a subsequent grant to a stranger. That such is the uniform course of decisions in Pennsylvania appears by numerous cases. Penrose v. Griffith, Maclay v. Work, Woods v. Wilson, Delaware & H. Canal Co. v. Dimock, Urket v. Coryell, 5 Watts & S. 60; Balliot v. Bauman, Id. Smith v. Vastbinder. 
31
32
It is next assigned for error that the court below erred in rejecting that portion of the return of William Gray, deputy surveyor, offered to be read in evidence by the defendants below. That portion of the return related to other surveys in the same township, returned as belonging to Dr. Ruston, and was offered for the ostensible purpose of explaining that part of the return of William Gray, the deputy surveyor, and the assessment for taxes received in evidence on the part of the plaintiff below, and in order to show that the taxes alleged to have been paid by Dr. Thomas Ruston might have been paid upon other tracts than the Lewis Walker tract in controversy. It seems to us, however, very clear that the offer was rightly rejected. That the part of the return offered related to other lands than the tract in question, was wholly irrelevant to the issue in the case, and did not tend to prove any material fact.
32
33
Neither was there any error in the other rulings of the court excepted to, in reference to other offers of evidence by the defendants below, made with the view of showing that Thomas Ruston paid taxes and made claims to other surveys in the name of Lewis Walker than that of the tract in dispute. None of them tended to show that Ruston was not the owner of the Lewis Walker tract in controversy, whatever they may have shown with reference to his claims to other tracts for which warrants and surveys had been made in the same name.
33
34
This disposes of all the questions raised by the assignments of error.
34
35
We find no error in the record, and the judgment is accordingly affirmed.

120 U.S. 479
UNITED STATES
v.
ARJONA.
March 7, 1887.
1
This is an indictment containing three counts against Ramon Arjona, for violations of sections 3 and 6 of the act of May ) 'to prevent and punish the counterfeiting within the United States of notes, bonds, and other securities of foreign governments.' The first and second counts were found under section 6 of the statute, and the third under section 3.

The statute makes the following things criminal: (1) Section 1. Forging or counterfeiting within the Unie d States, with intent to defraud, 'any bond, certificate, obligation, or other security of any foreign government, issued or put forth under the authority of such foreign government, or any treasury note, bill, or promise to pay issued by such foreign government, and intended to circulate as money, either by law, order, or decree of such foreign government.' (2) Section 2. Knowingly, and with intent to defraud, uttering, passing, or putting off in payment or negotiation, within the United States, any forged or counterfeit bonds, etc., such as are described in section

1. (3) Section 3. Falsely making, forging, or counterfeiting within the United States, with intent to defraud, or knowingly assisting therein, 'any bank note or bill issued by a bank or other corporation of any foreign country, and intended by the law or usage of such foreign country to circulate as money, such bank or corporation being authorized by the laws of such country.' (4) Section 4.

Having in possession any forged or counterfeit instruments mentioned in the preceding sections, with intent to utter, pass, or put them off, or to deliver them to others, with the intent that they may be uttered or passed. (6) Section 6. Having in possession 'any plate, or any part thereof, from which has been printed or may be printed any counterfeit note, bond, obligation, or other security, in whole or in part, of any foreign government, bank, or corporation, except by lawful authority;' or using such plate, or knowingly permitting or suffering 'the same to be used, in counterfeiting such foreign obligations, or any part thereof;' or engraving, or causing or procuring to be engraved, or assisting 'in engraving, any plate in the likeness or similitude of any plate designed for the printing of the genuine issues of the obligations of any foreign government, bank, or corporation;' or printing, photographing, or in any other manner making, executing, or selling, or causing 'to be printed, photographed, made, executed, or sold,; or aiding 'in printing, photographing, making, executing, or selling any engraving, photograph, print, or impression in the likeness of any genuine note, bond, obligation, or other security, or any part thereof, of any foreign government, bank, or corporation;' or bringing 'into the United States * * * any counterfeit plate, engraving, photograph, print, or other impressions of the notes, bonds, obligations, or other securities of any foreign government, bank, or corporation.'

4
The first count of the indictment charges Arjona with having 'in his control and custody a certain metallic plate from which there might then and there be printed in part a counterfeit note in the likeness and similitude in part of the notes theretofore issued by a foreign bank, to-wit, the bank known as El Banco del Estado de Bolivar, which said bank was then and there a bank authorized by the laws of a foreign state, to-wit, the state of Bolivar, said state being then and there one of the states of the United States of Columbia.' In the second count, he is charged with having caused and procured 'to be engraved a certain metallic plate in the likeness and similitude of a plate designed for the printing of the genuine issues of the obligations of a foreign bank, that is to say, of the bank-notes of the bank known as El Banco de Estado del Bolivar, the same being then and there a bank authorized by the laws of a foreign state, to-wit, the state of Bolivar, said state being then and there one of the states of the United States of Colombia.' In the third count, the charge is that he 'unlawfully, and with intent to defraud, did cause and rpocure to be falsely made a certain note in the similitude and resemblance of the notes theretofor issued by a bank of a foreign country, to-wit, the bank known as El Banco del Estado de Bolivar, the same being then and there a bank authorized by the laws of one of the states of the United States of Colombia, that is to say, the state of Bolivar, and the notes issued by the said bank being then and by the usage of the said state of Bolivar intended to circulate as money.'

5
To this indictment a demurrer was filed, and the judges holding the court have certified that at the hearing the following questions arose, upon which their opinions were opposed: (1) Whether the third section of the statute is constitutional; (2) whether the sixth section is constitutional, so far as it relates to 'foreign banks and corporations;' (3) whether the counterfeiting within the United States of the notes of a foreign bank or corporation can be constitutionally made by congress an offense against the law of nations; (4) whether the obligations of the law of nations, as referred to in the constitution of the United States, include the punishment of counterfeiting the notes of a foreign bank or corporation, or of having in possession a plate from which may be printed counterfeits of the notes of foreign banks or corporations, as mentioned in the third and sixth sections, 'unless it appear or is alleged in the indictment that the notes of said foreign bank or corporation are the notes or money of issue of a foreign government, prince, potentate, state, or power;' (5) whether, if there is power to 'so define the law of nations' as to include the offenses mentioned in the third and sixth sections, it is not necessary, in order 'to define' the offense, that it be declared in the statute itself 'to be an offense against the law of nations;' (6) whether the indictment is sufficient in law. The fourth of the questions thus stated embraces the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth of those certified, and the fifth embraces the ninth and tenth.

Congress has power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to carry into execution the powers vested by the constitution in the government of the United States, (article 1, § 8, cl. 18;) and the government of the United States has been vested exclusively with the power of representing the nation in all its intercourse with foreign countries. It alone can 'regulate commerce with foreign nations,' (article 1, § 8, cl. 3;) make treaties and appoint ambassadors and other public ministers and consuls, (article 2, § 2, cl. 2.) A state is expressly prohibited from entering into any 'treaty, alliance, or confederation.' Article 1, § 10, cl. 1. Thus all official intercourse between a state and foreign nations is prevented, and exclusive authority for that purpose given to the United States. The national government is in this way made responsible to foreign nations for all violations by the United States of their international obligations, and because of this congress is expressly authorized 'to define and punish * * * offenses against the law of nations.' Article 1, § 8, cl. 10. The law of nations requires every national government to use 'due diligence' to prevent a wrong being done within its own dominion to another nation with which it is at peace, or to the people thereof; and because of this, the obligation of one nation to punish those who, within its own jurisdiction, counterfeit the money of another nation has long been recognized. Vattel in his Law of Nations, which was first printed at Neuchatel in 1758, and was translated into English and published in England in 1760, uses this language: 'From the principles thus laid down, it is easy to conclude that, if one nation counterfeits the money of another, or if she allows and protects false coiners who presume to do it, she does that nation an injury.' When this was written money was the chief thing of this kind that needed protection, but still it was added: 'There is another custom more modern, and of no less use to commerce than the establishment of coin, namely, exh ange, or the traffic of bankers, by means of which a merchant remits immense sums from one end of the world to the other, at very trifling expense, and, if he pleases, without risk. For the same reason that sovereigns are obliged to protect commerce, they are obliged to support this custom, by good laws, in which every merchant, whether citizen or foreigner, may find security. In general, it is equally the interest and duty of every nation to have wise and equitable commercial laws established in the country.' Vat. Law. Nat. (Phil. Ed. In a note by Mr. Chitty, in his London edition of it is said: 'This is a sound principle, which ought to be extended so as to deny effect to any fraud upon a foreign nation or its subjects.' Id. 47, note 50. This rule was established for the protection of nations in their intercourse with each other. If there were no such intercourse, it would be a matter of no special moment to one nation that its money was counterfeited in another. Its own people could not be defrauded if the false coin did not come among them, and its own sovereignty would not be violated if the counterfeit could not, under any circumstances, be made to take the place of true money. But national intercourse includes commercial intercourse between the people of different nations. It is as much the duty of a nation to protect such an intercourse as it is any other, and that is what Vattel meant when he said: 'For the same reason that sovereigns are obliged to protect commerce, they are obliged to support this custom;' 'namely, exchange, or the traffic of bankers, by means of which a merchant remits immense sums from one end of the world to the other,' 'by good laws, in which every merchant, whether citizen or foreigner, may find security.' In the time of Vattel certificates of the public debt of a nation, government bonds, and other government securities, were rarely seen in any other country than that in which they were put out. Banks of issue were not so common as to need special protection for themselves or the public against forgers and counterfeiters great corporations, now so numerous great corporations, now so numberous and so important, established by public authority for the promotion of public enterprises, were almost unknown, and certainly they had not got to be extensive borrowers of money wherever it could be had at home or abroad on the faith of the quasi public securities. Now, however, the amount of national and corporate debt and of corporate property represented by bonds, certificates, notes, bills, and other forms of commercial securities, which are bought and sold in all the money markets of the world, both in and out of the country under whose authority they were created, is something enormous. Such being the case, it is easy to see that the same principles that developed, when it became necessary, the rule of national conduct which was intended to prevent, as far as might be, the counterfeiting of the money of one nation within the dominion of another, and which, in the opinion of so eminent a publicist as Vattel, could be applied to the foreign exchange of bankers, may, with just propriety, be extended to the protection of this more recent custom among bankers of dealing in foreign securities, whether national or corporate, which have been put out under the sanction of public authority at home, and sent abroad as the subjects of trade and commerce. And especially is this so of bank-notes and bank-bills issued under the authority of law, which, from their very nature, enter into and form part of the circulating medium of exchange—the money—of a country. Under such circumstances, every nation has not only the right to require the protection, as far as possible, of its own credit abroad against fraud, but the banks and other great commercial corporations which have been created within its own jurisdiction for the advancement of the public good may call on it to see that their intee sts are not neglected by a foreign government to whose dominion they have, in the lawful prosecution of their business, become to some extent subjected.

No nation can be more interested in this question than the United States. Their money is practically composed of treasury notes or certificates issued by themselves, or of bank-bills issued by banks created under their authority and subject to their control. Their own securities, and those of the states, the cities, and the public corporations, whose interests abroad they alone have the power to guard against foreign national neglect, are found on sale in the principal money markets of Europe. If these securities, whether national, municipal, or corporate, are forged and counterfeited with impunity at the places where they are sold, it is easy to see that a great wrong will be done to the United States and their people. Any uncertainty about the genuineness of the security necessarily depreciates its value as a merchantable commodity, and against this international comity requires that national protection shall, as far as possible, be afforded. If there is neglect in that, the United States may, with propriety, call on the proper government to provide for the punishment of such anoffense, and thus punishment of such an offense, and thus a fear of the consequences of wrong-doing. A refusal may not, perhaps, furnish sufficient cause for war; but it would certainly give just ground of complaint, and thus disturb that harmony between the governments which each is bound to cultivate and promote. But if the United States can require this of another, that other may require it of them, because international obligations are of necessity reciprocal in their nature. The right, if it exists at all, is given by the law of nations, and what is law for one is, under the same circumstances, law for the other. A right secured by the law of nations to a nation, or its people, is one the United States, as the representatives of this nation, are bound to protect. Consequently, a law which is necessary and proper to afford this protection is one that congress may enact, because it is one that is needed to carry into execution a power conferred by the constitution on the government of the United States exclusively. There is no authority in the United States to require the passage and enforcement of such a law by the states. Therefore, the United States must have the power to pass it and enforce it themselves, or be unable to perform a duty which they may owe to another nation, and which the law of nations has imposed on them as part of their international obligations. This, however, does not prevent a state from providing for the punishment of the same thing, for here, as in the case of counterfeiting the coin of the United of the United States, the act may be an offense against the authority of a state as well as that of the United States. Again, our own people may be dealers at home in the public or quasi public securities of a foreign government, or of foreign banks or corporations, brought here in the course of our commerce with foreign nations, or sent here from abroad for sale in the money markets of this country. As such they enter into and form part of the foreign commerce of the country. If such securities can be counterfeited here with impunity, our own people may be made to suffer by a wrong done which affects a business that has been expressly placed by the constitution under the protection of the government of the United States.

It remains only to consider those questions which present the point whether, in enacting a statute to define and punish an offense against the law of nations, it is necessary, in order 'to define' the offense, that it be declared in the statute itself to be 'an offense against the law of nations.' This statute defines the offense, and if the thing made punishable is one which the United States are required by their international obligations to use due diligence to prevent, iti § an offense against the law of nations. Such being the case, there is no more need of declaring in the statute that it is such an offense than there would be in any other criminal statute to declare that it was enacted to carry into execution any other particular power vested by the constitution or its people by counterfeiting its money, United States. Whether the offense as defined is an offense against the law of nations depends on the thing done, not on any declaration to that effect by congress. As has already been seen, it was incumbent on the United States as a nation to use due diligence to prevent any injury to another nation or its people by counterfeiting its money or its public or quasi public securities. This statute was enacted as a means to that end; that is to say, as a means of performing a duty which had been cast on the United States by the law of nations, and it was clearly appropriate legislation for that purpose. Upon its face, therefore, it defines an offense against the law of nations as clearly as if congress had in express terms so declared. Criminal statutes passed for enforcing and preserving the neutral relations of the United States with other nations were passed by congress at a very early date, (June c. March Id. 447;) and those now in force are found in title 67 of the Revised Statutes. These all rest on the same power of congress that is here invoked, and it has never been supposed they were invalid because they did not expressly declare that the offenses there defined were offenses against the law of nations.

If there is anything more in the eleventh question certified than has been already disposed of in answering the others, it is too broad and indefinite for our consideration under the rules which have been long established regulating the practice on a certificate of division.

120 U.S. 489
ROBBINS
v.
TAXING DISTRICT OF SHELBY CO., TENNESSEE.
March 7, 1887.
1
This case originated in the following manner: Sabine Robbins, the plaintiff in error, in February, 1884, was engaged at the city of Memphis, in the state of Tennessee, in soliciting the sale of goods for the firm of Rose, Robbins & Co., of Cincinnati, in the state of Ohio, dealers in paper and other articles of stationery, and exhibited samples for the purpose of effecting such sales,—an employment usually denominated as that of a 'drummer.' There was in force at that time a statute of Tennessee, relating to the subject of taxation in the taxing districts of the state, applicable, however, only to the taxing district of Shelby county, (formerly the city of Memphis,) by which it was enacted, among other things, that 'all drummers, and all persons not having a regular licensed house of business in the taxing district, offering for sale or selling goods, wares, or merchandise therein, by sample, shall be required to pay to the county trustee the sum of ten dollars ($10) per week, or twenty-five dollars per month, for such privilege; and no license shall be issued for a longer period than three months.' Act The business of selling by sample, and nearly 60 other occupations, had been by law declared to be privileges, and were taxed as such; and it was made a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not less than five, nor more than fifty, dollars, to exercise any of such occupations without having first paid the tax, or obtained a license required therefor. Under this law, Robbins, who had not paid the tax nor taken a license, was prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced to pay a fine of $10, together with the state and county tax, and costs; and, on appeal to the supremec ourt of the state, the judgment was affirmed. This writ of error is brought to review the judgment of the supreme court, on the ground that the law imposing the tax was repugnant to that clause of the constitution of the United States which declares that congress shall have power to regulate commerce among the several states.

2
On the trial of the cause in the inferior court, a jury being waived, the following agreed statement of facts was submitted to the court, to-wit: 'Sabine Robbins is a citizen and resident of Cincinnati, Ohio, and on the ___ day of ___, was engaged in the business of drumming in the taxing district of Shelby county, Tennessee,—i. e., soliciting trade, by the use of samples, for the house or firm for which he worked as drummer; said firm being the firm of 'Rose, Robbins & Co.,' doing business in Cincinnati, and all the members of said firm being citizens and residents of Cincinnati, Ohio. While engaged in the act of drumming for said firm, and for the claimed offense of not having taken out the required license for doing said business, the defendant, Sabine Robbins, was arrested by one of the Memphis or taxing district police force and carried before the Hon. D. P. Hadden, president of the taxing district, and fined for the offense of drumming without a license. It is admitted the firm of 'Rose, Robbins & Co.' are engaged in the selling of paper, writing materials, and such articles as are used in the book-stores of the taxing district of Shelby county, and that it was a line of such articles for the sale of which the said defendant herein was drumming at the time of his arrest.' This was all the evidence, and thereupon the court rendered judgment against the defendant, to which he excepted, and a bill of exceptions was taken.

The principal question argued before the supreme court of Tennessee was as to the constitutionality of the act which imposed the tax on drummers; and the court decided that it was constitutional and valid. That is the question before us, and it is one of great importance to the people of the United States, both as respects their business interests and their constitutional rights. It is presented in a nutshell, and does not, at this day, require for its solution any great elaboration of argument or review of authorities. Certain principles have been already established by the decisions of this court, which will conduct us to a satisfactory decision. Among those principles are the following:
3
4
1. The constitution of the United States having given to congress the power to regulate commerce, not only with foreign nations, but among the several states, that power is necessarily exclusive whenever the subjects of it are national in their character, or admit only of one uniform system, or plan of regulation. This was decided in the case of Cooley v. Board of Wardens of the Port of Philadelphia, and was virtually in volved in the case of Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, and has been confirmed in many subsequent cases; among others, in Brown v. Maryland, Passenger Cases, Crandall v. Nevada, Ward v. Maryland, State Freight Tax Cases, Henderson v. Mayor of New York, Railroad Co. v. Husen, Mobile v. Kimball, Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, Sup. Ct. Rep. Wabash R. Co. v. Illinois, Sup. Ct. Rep. 4.
4
5
2. Another established doctrine of this court is that, where the power on congress to regulate is exclusive, the failure of congress to make express regulations indicates its will that the subject shall be left free from any restrictions or impositions; and any regulation of the subject by the states, except in matters of local concern only, as hereafter mentioned, is repugnant to such freedom. This was held byM r. Justice JOHNSON in Gibbons v. Ogden, by Mr. Justice GRIER in the Passenger Cases, and has been affirmed in subsequent cases. State Freight Tax Cases, Railroad Co. v. Husen, Welton v. Missouri, County of Mobile v. Kimball, Brown v. Houston, Sup. Ct. Rep. Walling v. Michigan, Sup. Ct. Rep. Pickard v. Pullman Palace Car Co., Sup. Ct. Rep. Wabash R. Co. v. Illinois, Sup. Ct. Rep. 4.
5
6
3. It is also an established principle, as already indicated, that the only way in which commerce between the states can be legitimately affected by state laws is when, by virtue of its police power, and its jurisdiction over persons and property within its limits, a state provides for the security of the lives, limbs, health, and comfort of persons and the protection of property, or when it does those things which may otherwise incidentally affect commerce; such as the establishment and regulation of highways, canals, railroads, wharves, ferries, and other commercial facilities; the passage of inspection laws to secure the due quality and measure of products and commodities; the passage of laws to regulate or restrict the sale of articles deemed injurious to the health or morals of the community; the imposition of taxes upon persons residing within the state or belonging to its population, and upon avocations and employments pursued therein, not directly connected with foreign or interstate commerce, or with some other employment or business exercised under authority of the constitution and laws of the United States, and the imposition of taxes upon all property within the state, mingled with and forming part of the great mass of property therein. But, in making such internal regulations, a state cannot impose taxes upon persons passing through the state, or coming into it merely for a temporary purpose, especially if connected with interstate or foreign commerce; nor can it impose such taxes upon property imported into the state from abroad, or from another state, and not yet become part of the common mass of property therein; and no discrimination can be made by any such regulations adversely to the persons or property of other states; and no regulations can be made directly affecting interstate commerce. Any taxation or regulation of the latter character would be an unauthorized interference with the power give to congress over the subject. For authorities on this last head it is only necessary to refer to those already cited. In a word, it may be said that, in the matter of interstate commerce, the United States are but one country, and are and must be subject to one system of regulations, and not to a multitude of systems. The doctrine of the freedom of that commerce, except as regulated by congress, is so firmly established that it is unnecessary to enlarge further upon the subject.
6
7
In view of these fundamental principles, which are to govern our decision, we may approach the question submitted to us in the present case, and inquire whether it is competent for a state to levy a tax or impose any other restriction upon the citizens or inhabitants of other states for selling or seeking to sell their goods in such state before they are introduced therein. Do not such restrictions affect the very foundation of interstate trade? How is a manufacturer or a merchant of one state to sell his goods in another state, without, in some way, obtaining orders therefor? Must he be compelled to send them at a venture, without knowing whether there is any demand for them? This may, undoubtedly, be safely done with regard to some products for which there is always a market and a demand, or where the course of trade has established a general and unlimited demand. A raiser of farm produce in New Jersey or Connecticut, or a manufactue r of leather or woodenware, may, perhaps, safely take his goods to the city of New York, and be sure of finding a stable and reliable market for them. But there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of articles which no person would think of exporting to another state without first procuring an order for them. It is true, a merchant or manufacturer in one state may erect or hire a warehouse or store in another state, in which to place his goods, and await the chances of being able to sell them; but this would require a warehouse or store in every state with which he might desire to trade. Surely, he cannot be compelled to take this inconvenient and expensive course. In certain branches of business, it may be adopted with advantage. Many manufacturers do open houses or places of business in other states than those in which they reside, and send their goods there to be kept on sale; but this is a matter of convenience, and not of compulsion, and would neither suit the convenience nor be within the ability of many others engaged in the same kinds of business, and would be entirely unsuited to many branches of business. In these cases, then, what shall the merchant or manufacturer do, who wishes to sell his goods in other states? Must he sit still in his factory or warehouse, and wait for the people of those states to come to him? This would be a silly and ruinous proceeding. The only other way, and the one, perhaps, which most extensively prevails, is to obtain orders from persons residing or doing business in those other states. But how is the merchant or manufacturer to secure such orders? If he may be taxed by such states for doing so, who shall limit the tax? It may amount to prohibition. To say that such a tax is not a burden upon interstate commerce, is to speak at least unadvisedly, and without due attention to the truth of things. It may be suggested that the merchant or manufacturer has the post-office at his command, and may solicit orders through the mails. We do not suppose, however, that any one would seriously contend that this is the only way in which his business can be transacted without being amenable to exactions on the part of the state. Besides, why could not the state to which his letters might be sent, tax him for soliciting orders in this way, as well as in any other way? The truth is, that in numberless instances, the most feasible, if not the only practicable, way for the merchant or manufacturer to obtain orders in other states is to obtain them by personal application, either by himself or by some one employed by him for that purpose; and in many branches of business he must necessarily exhibit samples for the purpose of determining the kind and quality of the goods he proposes to sell, or which the other party desires to purchase. But the right of taxation, if it exists at all, is not confined to selling by sample. It embraces every act of sale, whether by word of mouth only, or by the exhibition of samples. If the right exists, any New York or Chicago merchant, visiting New Orleans or Jacksonville for pleasure or for his health, and casually taking an order for goods to be sent from his warehouse, could be made liable to pay a tax for so doing, or be convicted of a misdemeanor for not having taken out a license. The right to tax would apply equally as well to the principal as to his agent, and to a single act of sale as to a hundred acts.
7
8
But it will be said that a denial of this power of taxation will interfere with the right of the state to tax business pursuits and callings carried on within its limits, and its right to require licenses for carrying on those which are declared to be privileges. This may be true to a certain extent, but only in those cases in which the states themselves, as well as individual citizens, are subject to the restraints of the higher law of the constitution; and this interference will be very limited in its operation. It will only prevent the levy of a tax, or the requirements of a license, for mk ing negotiations in the conjuct of interstate commerce; and it may well be asked where the state gets authority for imposing burdens on that branch of business any more than for imposing a tax on the business of importing from foreign countries, or even on that of postmaster or United States marshal. The mere calling the business of a drummer a privilege, cannot make it so. Can the state legislature make it a Tennessee privilege to carry on the business of importing goods from foreign countries? If not, has it any better right to make it a state privilege to carry on interstate commerce? It seems to be forgotten in argument that the people of this country are citizens of the United States, as well as of the individual states, and that they have some rights under the constitution and laws of the former, independent of the latter, and free from any interference or restraint from them. To deny to the state the power to lay the tax or require the license in question, will not, in any perceptible degree, diminish its resources, or its just power of taxation. It is very true that, if the goods when sold were in the state, and part of its general mass of property, they would be liable to taxation; but when brought into the state in consequence of the sale, they will be equally liable; so that, in the end, the state will derive just as much revenue from them as if they were there before the sale. As soon as the goods are in the state, and become part of its general mass of property, they will become liable to be taxed in the same manner as other property of similar character, as was distinctly held by this court in the case of Brown v. Houston, Sup. Ct. Rep. When goods are sent from one state to another for sale, or in consequence of a sale, they become part of its general property, and amenable to its laws: provided that no discrimination be made against them as goods from another state, and that they be not taxed by reason of being brought from another state, but only taxed in the usual way, as other goods are. Brown v. Houston, qua supra; Machine Co. v. Gage, But to tax the sale of such goods, or the offer to sell them, before they are brought into the state, is a very different thing, and seems to us clearly a tax on interstate commerce itself.
8
9
It is strongly urged, as if it were a material point in the case, that no discrimination is made between domestic and foreign drummers,—those of Tennessee and those of other states; that all are taxed alike. But that does not meet the difficulty. Interstate commerce cannot be taxed at all, even though the same amount of tax should be laid on domestic commerce, or that which is carried on solely within the state. This was decided in the case of State Freight Tax Cases, The negotiation of sales of goods which are in another state, for the purpose of introducing them into the state in which the negotiation is made, is interstate commerce. A New Orleans merchant cannot be taxed there for ordering goods from London or New York, because, in the one case, it is an act of foreign, and, in the other, of interstate, commerce, both of which are subject to regulation by congress alone. It would not be difficult, however, to show that the tax authorized by the state of Tennessee in the present case is discriminative against the merchants and manufacturers of other states. They can only sell their goods in Memphis by the employment of drummers and by means of samples; while the merchants and manufacturers of Memphis, having regular licensed houses of business there, have no occasion for such agents, and, if they had, they are not subject to any tax therefor. They are taxed for their licensed houses, it is true; but so, it is presumable, are the merchants and manufacturers of other states in the places where they reside; and the tax on drummers operates greatly to their disadvantage in comparison with the merchants and manufacturers of Memphis. And such was undoubtedly n e of its objects. This kind of taxation is usually imposed at the instance and solicitation of domestic dealers as a means of protecting them from foreign competition; and in many cases there may be some reason in their desire for such protection. But this shows in a still stronger light the unconstitutionality of the tax. It shows that it not only operates as a restriction upon interstate commerce, but that it is intended to have that effect as one of its principal objects. And if a state can, in this way, impose restrictions upon interstate commerce for the benefit and protection of its own citizens, we are brought back to the condition of things which existed before the adoption of the constitution, and which was one of the principal causes that led to it. If the selling of goods by sample, and the employment of drummers for that purpose, injuriously affect the local interest of the states, congress, if applied to, will undoubtedly make such reasonable regulations as the case may demand. And congress alone can do it; for it is obvious that such regulations should be based on a uniform system applicable to the whole country, and not left to the varied, discordant, or retaliatory enactments of 40 different states. The confusion into which the commerce of the country would be thrown by being subject to state legislation on this subject would be but a repetition of the disorder which prevailed under the articles of confederation.
9
10
To say that the tax, if invalid as against drummers from other states, operates as a discrimination against the drummers of Tennessee, against whom it is conceded to be valid, is no argument, because the state is not bound to tax its own drummers; and if it does so, while having no power to tax those of other states, it acts of its own free will, and is itself the author of such discriminations. As before said, the state may tax its own internal commerce; but that does not give it any right to tax interstate commerce.
10
11
The judgment of the supreme court of Tennessee is reversed, and the plaintiff in error must be discharged.
11
12
I am unable to agree to this judgment. The case, as I understand it, is this: In January, 1879, the state of Tennessee abolished the charter of the city of Memphis, and created the taxing district of Shelby county as its successor. By a statute passed April 4, 1881, to provide means for the support of the taxing district, it was, among other things enacted 'that all drummers, and all persons not having a licensed house of business in the taxing district, offering for sale or selling goods, wares, or merchandise therein by sample, shall be required to pay to the county trustees the sum of ten dollars ($10) per week, or twenty-five dollars per month, for such privilege, and no license shall be issued for a longer period than three months.' Sabine Robbins, a citizen of Ohio, employed by the firm of Rose, Robbins & Co., also citizens of Ohio, engaged in business as merchants at the city of Cincinnati, in that state, has been convicted of a violation of this statute, because he solicited trade for his firm in the taxing district, by the use of samples, without a license. This it is now decided was wrong, because the statute under which the conviction was had, in so far as it applies to the business in which Robbins was engaged, is a regulation of interstate commerce, and therefore repugnant to the commerce clause of the constitution of the United States. To this I cannot give my assent.
12
13
The license fees are demanded for the privilege of selling goods by sample within the taxing district. The fee is exacted from all alike who do that kind of business, unless they have 'a licensed house of business' in the district. There is no discrimination between citizens of the state and citizens of other states. The tax is upon the business, and this I have always understood to be lawful, whether the business was carried on by a citizen of the state undel whose authority the exaci on was made, or a citizen of another state, unless there was discrimination against citizens of other states. In Osborne v. Mobile, it is said 'the whole court agreed that a tax on business carried on within the state, and without discrimination between its citizens and the citizens of other states, might be constitutionally imposed and collected.' And I cannot believe that if Robbins had opened an office for his business within the taxing district, at which he kept and exhibited his samples, it would be held that he would not be liable to the tax; and this, whether he stayed there all the time, or came only at intervals. But what can be the difference in principle, so far as this question is concerned, whether he takes a room permanently in a business block of the district where, when he comes, he sends his boxes and exhibits his wares, or engages a room temporarily at a notel or private house, and carries on his business there during the stay? Or even whether he takes his sample boxes around with him to his different customers, and shows his wares from them? In either case, he goes to the district to ply his trade, and make his sales from the goods he exhibits. He does not sell those goods, but he sells others like them. It is true that his business was to solicit orders for his principals; but, in doing so, he bargained for them, carried on business for them, in the district by means of the samples of their goods which had been furnished him for that purpose. To all intents and purposes he had his goods with him for sale; for what he sold was like what he exhibited as the subjects of sale. I am unable to see any difference in principle between a tax on a seller by sample and a tax on a peddler; and yet I can hardly believe it would be contended that the provision of the same statute now in question, which fixes a license fee for all peddlers in the district, would be held to be unconstitutional in its application to peddlers who came with their goods from another state, and expected to go back again. As the law is valid so far as the inhabitants of the state are concerned, no inhabitant can engage in this business unless he pays the tax. If citizens of other states cannot be taxed in the same way for the same business, there will be discrimination against the inhabitants of Tennessee, and in favor of those of other states. This could never have been intended by the legislature, and I cannot believe the constitution of the United States makes such a thing necessary. The constitution gives the citizens of each state all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states; but this certainly does not guaranty to those who are doing business in states other than their own, immunities from taxation on that business to which citizens of the state where the business is carried on are subjected.
13
14
This case shows the need of such authority in the states. This taxing district is situated on the western boundary of Tennessee. To get into another state it is only necessary to cross the Mississippi river to Arkansas. It may be said to be an historical fact that the charter of Memphis was abolished, and the taxing district established, because of the oppressive debt of Memphis, and the records of this court furnish abundant evidence of the heavy taxation to which property and business within the limits of both the old corporation and the new have been for many years necessarily subjected. Merchants in Tennessee are by law required to pay taxes on the amount of their stock on hand, and a privilege tax besides. Under these circumstances, it is easy to see that if a merchant from another state could carry on a business in the district by sending his agents there with samples of his goods to secure orders for deliveries from his stock at home, he would enjoy a privilege of exemption from taxation which the local merchant would not have, unless in some form he could be subjected to taxation for what he did in the locality. The samew ould be true in respect to all inhabitants of the state who were sellers by sample in this district, but who had no place of business there. And so they, like citizens of other states, were required to pay for the privilege. Thus all were treated alike, whether they were citizens of Tennessee or of some other state, and, under these circumstances, I can see no constitutional objection to such a taxation of citizens of the other states for their business in the district.
14
15
I have treated the case as a conviction of a 'drummer' for selling goods by sample. That is what Robbins was found guilty of, and that is what this statute makes an offense. The license is only required of 'drummers and all persons not having a licensed house of business in the taxing district, offering for sale or selling goods, wares, or merchandise therein by sample.' The supreme court of Tennessee decided that this means nothing more than that any person who sells by sample shall pay the tax, and to that I agree. It will be time enough to consider whether a non-resident can be taxed for merely soliciting orders without having samples when such a case arises. That is not this case.

CORSON
v.
MARYLAND.
March 7, 1887.
1
Mr. Justice FIELD, Mr. Justice GRAY, and myself agree to this judgment, but on different grounds from those stated in the opinion of the court. It is not denied that the statute of Maryland requires a non-resident merchant, desiring to sell by sample in that state, to pay for a license to do that business a sum to be ascertained by the amount of his stock in trade in the state where he resides, and in which he has his principal place of business. This differs materially from the statute of Tennessee, which was considered in Robbins v. Taxing Dist. Shelby Co., ante, (just decided,) and is in its effect, as we think, a tax on commerce among the states. The charge for the privilege to the non-resident is measured by his capacity for doing business all over the United States, and without any reference to the amount done or to be done in Maryland.

SCHULER
v.
ISRAEL and another.1
March 7, 1887.
1
The plaintiff in error, who was plaintiff below, brought two separate suits in the circuit court of the city of St. Louis, Missouri, on the same day, against C. W. Israel and J. N. Israel, as partners in the banking business. One case was brought upon a note for the sum of $ and the other upon a draft made by C. W. Israel & Co. for $on the Laclede Bank, on which payment was refused when presented at the bank, and the draft duly protested. In each of these cases a writ of attachment was issued at the commencement of the suit, which was served, by way of garnishment, on the Laclede Bank, also of St. Louis. An order of publication was made in the state court against C. W. Israel and J. N. Israel on account of their being non-residents, and the two suits were removed into the circuit court of the United States for the Eastern district of Missouri, upon the application of the plaintiff, upon the ground that he was a citizen of the state of Kansas and the two Israels were citizens of the state of Texas. They were there consolidated and heard as one case.

J. N. Israel appeared, and filed an answer for himself alone, in which he made no defense to the suit on the check, but set up as a defense to the suit on the note that, before the institution of the present suit in the Missouri court, the plaintiff had commenced an action on the same note in the circuit court of the United States for the Northern district of Texas, and had, at the time of the plea filed, recovered a judgment against the defendant J. N. Israel on said note, whereby he claimed that the note was merged in said judgment, and no judgment could be rendered on it in this action. Judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiff for the amount of the check. The suit was dismissed by plaintiff, before hearing, as to C. W. Israel.

The Laclede Bank, in its response to the garnishee process served on it under the attachment, and in answer to interrogatories propounded to it by thep laintiff, admitted that there were on the twenty-fourth day of October, 1885, standing on its books, to the credit of the three several banking companies of which J. N. Israel was a partner, certain sums of money. The attachment process was served on the Laclede Bank, November 2, 1885; and the bank in its answer says that on the twenty-fourth of October the said Israel, being wholly insolvent, made, executed, and delivered a deed of general assignment in conformity with the laws of the state of Texas, where he resided, for the benefit of all his creditors, which assignment is set forth in the answer, and that the bank had notice of this assignment immediately after it was made. It further answered that the said J. N. Israel individually and as a member of the several banking houses before referred to, namely, C. W. Israel & Co., the Exchange Bank of Harold, and the Exchange Bank of Wichita Falls, was indebted to the Laclede Bank in an amount exceeding all the sums on deposit with that bank at the date of the service of the attachment.

The plaintiff demurred to the answer of the defendant Israel, setting up the judgment recovered in the United States court for the Northern district of Texas on the note, and he demurred also to the answer of the Laclede Bank as garnishee, and the case was submitted to the court on these demurrers. The court rendered a judgment overruling both demurrers, finding for the defendant Israel in the suit upon the note, and rendering judgment against him in the suit on the check. It also discharged the bank as garnishee.

5
The plaintiff brings this case here by writ of error, and the two questions presented are, first, as to the sufficiency of the answer of J. N. Israel setting up the judgment in the action on the same note in Texas.
5
6
While it is certainly true that the pendency of a suit in one court is not a defense, though it may sometimes be good in abatement, to another suit on the same cause of action in another court of concurrent jurisdiction, it may be considered as established that when a judgment is recovered against the defendant in one of those courts, if it is a full and complete judgment on the whole cause of action, it may be pleaded as a defense to the action in that court where it is pending and undecided. Neither court would be bound to take notice of the judgment in the other court judicially, but when the matter is pleaded in due time, and it is made to appear that a judgment on the same cause of action has been recovered, and is in full force and effect, that judgment must be held to merge the evidence of the debt, whether that evidence be parol or written, in the judgment first recovered. Freem. Judgm. § Barnes v. Gibbs, McGilvray & Co. v. Avery, Rogers v. Odell, Bank v. Wheeler, Eldred v. Bank, The court below was right, therefore, in overruling the demurrer to the plea, and rendering judgment for the defendant.
6
7
As regards the order discharging the granishee, it seems to us that, without reference to the question of the validity of the assignment of Israel, the answer of the bank sets up a sufficient defense in the fact of the insolvency of J. N. Israel, and his indebtedness as partner, in the various banking companies above mentioned, to the Laclede Bank. The answer of the bank states explicitly that at the time of the service of the summons in garnishment on it, namely, November 2, 1885, it had not, 'nor has it since, or has it now, in its possession, custody, or charge, any lands, tenements, goods, chattels, moneys, credits, or effects belonging to the defendants in said cases, or either of them; (2) at said date of garnishment it, the said bank, was not indebted in anywise to said defendants, or either of them, nor has it since become so indebted, nor is it now so indebted; (3) at said date of garnishment said bank was not bound in any contract to pay said defendants, or either of them, any money nt then due, nor has it since said date become so indebted.'
7
8
The bank then goes on to give a detail of its transactions with Israel and his various banks, in which it is shown that, while there was in the bank's hands certain moneys deposited by Israel and his several banking houses, Israel was indebted to the bank in various sums at the time of his failure, October 24, 1885, some of which had matured, and others of which had not matured, at the time of the service of the garnishee process. But, as Israel and all his banks were insolvent at the time of the service of the garnishee process, we are of opinion that the bank had the right to appropriate any moneys in its hands to the security and payment of these obligations, whether due or not. If we are correct in this proposition, the answer of the bank is sufficient.
8
9
As we understand the law concerning the condition of a garnishee in attachment, he has the same rights in defending himself against that process at the time of its service upon him that he would have had against the debtor in the suit for whose property he is called upon to account. And while it may be true that in a suit brought by Israel against the bank it could, in any ordinary action at law, only make plea of set-off of so much of Israel's debt to the bank as was then due, it could, by filing a bill in chancery in such case, alleging Israel's insolvency, and that, if it was compelled to pay its own debt to Israel, the debt which Israel owed it, but which was not due, would be lost, be relieved by a proper decree in equity; and, as a garnishee is only compelled to be responsible for that which, both in law and equity, ought to have gone to pay the principal defendant in the main suit, he can set up all the defenses in this proceeding which he would have in either a court of law or a court of equity.

LACLEDE BANK, and another, Assignee, etc.,
v.
SCHULER.1
SCHULER
v.
SAME.
March 7, 1887.
1
This is an appeal and cross-appeal from a decree of the circuit court of the United States for the Eastern district of Missouri. Harrison B. Schuler, a citizen of the state of Kansas, brought his bill in that court against the Laclede Bank, a corporation under the laws of the state of Missouri, and J. T. Craig, a citizen of the state of Texas. The substance of the bill is that the plaintiff is the owner and holder of a draft, or bank check, drawn by C. W. Israel & Co. on the Laclede Bank, for the sum of $ dated at Henrietta, Texas, October 20, 1885, in favor of the plaintiff, which was duly presented for payment on the twenty-sixth day of that month; and that payment was refused, as the Lacede Bank alleged, on the ground that C. W. Israel & Co., the drawers of the draft, had, on October 24, 1885, made an assignment under the laws of Texas for the benefit of their creditors, of which the said Laclede Bank had been advised by telegraph. The bill proceeds upon the idea that there were funds in the hands of the Laclede Bank to the credit of C. W. Israel & Co., on the presentation of said check for payment, which ought to be applied for that purpose, and charges that, notwithstanding the general assignment for the benefit of creditors made by C. W. Israel & Co. on October 24, 1885, the check in question, made in favor of the plaintiff on October 20, 1885, was an assignment or appropriation of so much of those funds to the benefit of complainant which he is entitled to enforce in this suit. J. T. Craig, who had become substituted for Davidson, the assignee of C. W. Israel & Co., was also made a party to the suit, and appeared and filed an answer.
1
2
The answer of the Laclede Bank, while admitting most of the statements made in the bill, is very long, and recites many things not material to the issue as we look upon it, but relies upon two substantial defenses to the suit. The first of these is that on the morning of the twenty-sixty day of October, 1885, it received the following telegram from C. W. Israel & Co.: 'HENRIETTA, Texas, 24, [meaning the twenty-fourth of October.] Laclede Bank, St. L.: We assigned this day in favor of S. Davidson; hold funds subject to his order. C. W. ISRAEL & CO.' It alleges that this telegram was forwarded to the bank as a night message on Saturday night, and, although duly received at the telegraph office, was only delivered at 8 o'clock on Monday morning, and that the check in favor of complainant was presented at the opening of the bank at on the same morning, which was the first notice that they had of it. The answer insists that the general assignment, with the notice of it by telegraph, was a complete revocation of the Schuler check, as well as all other checks drawn against this defendant by C. W. Israel & Co., and that the assignment, with this prior notice to the bank, vested in the assignee the better right to any funds of said C. W. Israel & Co. in the hands of the bank. The answer also sets up transactions between C. W. Israel & Co. and the bank by which said C. W. Israel & Co. would be indebted, on a settlement of the transactions between the two banks, to the Laclede Bank in a sum beyond anything which they then held on deposit to the credit of C. W. Israel & Co. A part, however, of the trana ctions which go to make up this claim of set-off against C. W. Israel & Co. consisted of a note or notes discounted by the Laclede Bank for said C. W. Israel & Co., but which had not yet matured. The answer also sets up that C. W. Israel & Co. and the Laclede Bank were corresponding banks, one being in Texas and the other in St. Louis, Missouri, and that there had been a long course of dealing between them, and for this reason they had discounted the notes of C. W. Israel & Co. without any other sufficient security. Craig, as assignee for C. W. Israel & Co., filed a separate answer, in which he sets out mainly the same matters found in the answer of the Laclede Bank, and he also makes a part of his answer the assignment of C. W. Israel & Co. to Davidson for the benefit of all their creditors. There were no replications to either of these answers, but a stipulation is filed in regard to facts that are agreed upon by the parties, which closes with this paragraph: 'All other facts in the bill and answer not inconsistent herewith are to be taken as part of this agreed statement.'
2
3
The decree of the court was as follows: 'This cause came on for hearing at this term of the court on the bill of complaint, answers of defendants, and stipulations on file, and the court, being fully advised concerning the premises, finds that at the date of the presentation to the said Laclede Bank of the check set out in the bill of complaint there was to the credit of the account of C. W. Israel & Co. in said bank the sum of $subject to the payment of said check, and that said check operated in equity as an assignment of said sum, as against said defendants, to said complainant. It is therefore ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the said complainant have and recover of and from said defendants the said sum of $ together with interest at six per cent. per annum from the twenty-sixth day of October, 1885, amounting to $ and it is further ordered that execution issue therefor against said defendant the Laclede Bank.'
3
4
From this decree both Schuler and the bank appealed. The assignee, craig, did not appeal.

5
The question of how far and under what circumstances a check of a depositor in a bank will be considered an equitable assignment to the payee of the check, of all or any portion of the funds or deposits to the credit of the drawer in the bank, is one which has been very much considered of late years in the courts, and about which there is not a unanimity of opinion. In this court it is very well settled that such a check, unless accepted by the bank, will not sustain an action at law by the drawee against the bank, as there is no privity of contract between them. Marine Bank v. Fulton, Bank of Republic v. Millard, Bank v. Whitman, But while this may be considered as the established doctrine of this court in regard to the rights of the parties at law, and is probably the prevailing doctrine in nearly all the courts, it is urged in this case, and several respectable courts have so decided, that such a check is an appropriation of the amount for which it is drawn of the funds of the drawer in the hands of the bank. Roberts v. Austin, Fogarties v. State Bank, Munn v. Burch, 25 Ill. 35; German Sav. Inst. v. Adae, McCrary. 
5
6
But however this doctrine may operate to secure an equitable interest in the fund deposited in the bank to the credit of the drawer after notice to the bank of the check, or presentation to it for payment,—a question which we do not here decide,—we are of opinion that, as to the bank itself, the holder of the fund, and its duties and obligations in regard to it, the bank remains unaffected by the execution of such a check until notice has been given to it or demand made upon it for its payment.
6
7
In the case before us it is a conceded fact that, before the bank had any knowledge or notice whatever of the checko n which the plaintiff brings this suit, it had received a distinct notification from the drawer of that check that he had made a general assignment for the benefit of his creditors, with an express direction to hold the funds subject to the order of the assignee. Therefore, even if the check could be considered as an attempt on the part of C. W. Israel & Co. to assign or appropriate this amount in the hands of the bank to Schuler, the general assignment for the benefit of all their creditors of all their assets, including those in the hands of the bank, was made and brought to the attention of the bank, with directions to turn them over to this assignee, before it had any notice of the check in favor of Schuler.
7
8
The learned judge who decided the case on the circuit rested his judgment, in an opinion which is found in the record, on the proposition that, as between these two equities, namely, the equities of the general creditors under the assignment to Davidson, and this implied assignment in equity by the drawing of the check, the latter was superior. In this it would seem that he was somewhat influenced by the fact that he was enabled to trace the sources of some of the deposits to the credit of C. W. Israel & Co., in the Laclede Bank, to money which in a roundabout way had been collected for the payment of a debt to Schuler, and had finally been deposited to the credit of C. W. Israel & Co. in the Laclede Bank. But there is no allegation in the bill, nor any evidence in the testimony, nor any reason to believe, that the bank knew anything of this connection between the sums received from several of the banks with which Israel was connected at different times and the debt of Schuler. This is expressly denied, and we can see no reason why the bank should be held in any way to regard the deposit made by C. W. Israel & Co. as, in law or in equity, funds in which Schuler had an interest. It must therefore be left entirely out of the argument in the contest between the bank and Schuler.
8
9
Apart from this matter, it is not easy to see any valid reason why the assignment of an insolvent debtor, for the equal benefit of all his creditors, of all his property, does not confer on those creditors an equity equal to that of the holder of an unpaid check upon his banker. The holder of this check comes into the distribution of the funds in the hands of the assignee for his share of those funds with other creditors. The mere fact that he had received a check, a few days before the making of the assignment, on the bank, which had not been presented until after the general assignment was made and notified to the bank, does not seem, in and of itself, to give any such superiority of right. The assignment was complete and perfect, and vested in the assignee the right to all the property of the assignor immediately upon its execution and delivery, with due formalities, to the assignee, and the check of this assignee, like the check of Israel & Co., could have been paid by the bank with safety, if first presented. The check given by the same assignor a few days before was only an acknowledgment of a debt by that assignor, and became no valid claim upon the funds against which it was drawn until the holder of those funds was notified of its existence. This, we think, is the fair result of the authorities on that subject.
9
10
In the case of Spain v. Hamilton's Adm'r, this court says: 'Any order, writing, or act which makes an appropriation of a fund amounts to an equitable assignment of the fund. The reason is that, the fund being a matter not assignable at law, nor capable of manual possession, an appropriation of it is all that the nature of the case admits of, and therefore it is held good in a court of equity. As the assignee is generally entitled to all the remedies of the assignor, so he is subject to all the equities between the assignor and his debtor. But in order to perfect his title against the debtor it is indispensable that the assignee should immediately give notice of the assg nment to the debtor, for otherwise a priority of right may be obtained by a subsequent assignee, or the debt may be discharged by a payment to the assignee before such notice.'
10
11
The same principle is also laid down in Christmas v. Russell, 14 Wall. 69; Story, Eq. Jur. §§ . See especially the authorities cited in note 1 to this latter section. See, also, Ward v. Morrison, and Loomis v. Loomis. 
11
12
For these reasons we are of opinion that, at the time of the presentation of the check to the bank, the bank held no funds subject to its payment, whether we consider the delivery of it by C. W. Israel & Co. to Schuler as intended to create an equitable assignment or not. An earnest effort is made in the argument of counsel in this court to impeach the general assignment as being void under the laws of Texas, where it was made, and also in the state of Missouri, where this fund was. As there is nothing in the statute of Missouri which would make this assignment absolutely void, and there is nothing brought to our attention to prove that it was void by the laws of Texas, and as the assignment, though mentioned in the original bill of complainant, is not assailed, nor any ground set forth to show its invalidity, we do not think there is any reason why it should not be held in this proceeding to be a valid assignment. As this assignment had the effect, when the bank was notified of it, to transfer to the assignee all right to any funds in its hands which Israel could assert, we need not consider the other questions connected with the case.
12
13
The result of these views is that the decree against the bank must be reversed, and the case remanded, with instructions to dismiss the bill.

120 U.S. 517
COUNTY OF CARTER
v.
SINTON.1
March 7, 1887.
1
The principal points presented by the argument of the plaintiff arise on the demurrer to the petition, and they may be stated thus: (1) The act of January 30, 1878, is void by the constitution of Kentucky, because the subject to which it relates is not clearly expressed in its title. (2) The act is also unconstitutional and void because it vests in the county court of Carter county the power to bind the parts of Elliott and Boyd counties which had been set off from Carter. (3) The act gave no authority to the county court of Carter county to issue negotiable securities which pass by delivery, and in the hands of innocent holders are free from defenses which would be good as between the original parties. (4) There is a defect of parties defendant, because Carter county is sued alone, without joining 'those parts of Boyd and Elliott counties taken from Carter.'
1
2
1. As to the title of the act. The provision of the constitution of Kentucky relied on is article 2, § 37, as follows: 'No law enacted by the general assembly shall relate to more than one subject, and that shall be expressed in the title.' Undoubtedly the design of this provision was, as is said in Pennington v. Woolfolk, 79 Ky. 20, 'to prevent the use of deceptive titles as a cover for vicious legislation, by enabling members of the general assembly to form such opinion of the nature of a bill by merely hearing it read by its title;' but as early as the court of appeals said in Phillips v. Covington & Cincinnati Bridge Co., 'This prohibition should receive a reasonable and not a technical construction; and, looking to the evil intended to be remedied, it should be applied to such acts of the legislature alone as are obviously within its spirit and meaning. None of the provisions of a statute should be regarded as unconstitutional when they all relate directly or indirectly to the same subject, have a natural connection, and are not foreign to the subject expressed in its title.' This is in accord with the decisions of this court in Montclair v. Ramsdell, Sup. Ct. Rep. where we followed the rulings of the supreme court of New Jersey upon a similar provision in the constitution of that state; in Jonesboro City v. Cairo & St. L. R. Co., Sup. Ct. Rep. 67, and Mahomet v. Quackenbush, Sup. Ct. Rep. where the constitution of Illinois and the decisions of the supreme court of that state were considered; and in Otoe County v. Baldwin, Sup. Ct. Rep. which had reference to the constitution of Nebraska, and the settled rule of decision in that state; and in Ackley School-dist. v. Hall, Sup. Ct. Rep. which arose in Iowa. It is enough if the law has but one general object, and that object is fairly expressed in its title. Cooley, Const. Lim. (h Ed.) 175.
2
3
Here the title is 'An act authorizing the county of Carter, and those parts of the counties of Boyd and Elliott taken from Carter county, to compromise and settle with the holders of the bonds and coupons of interest exc uted by Carter county in its subscription to the capital stock of the Lexington & Big Sandy Railroad Company, and to levy and collect a tax for that purpose.' This clearly and distinctly expresses the whole object of the legislation, and there is nothing in the body of the act itself which is not in every way germane to what is there expressed. No one interested in the subject-matter of the law could be put off his guard by hearing the bill read by its title. True, it does not state that the county court of Carter county is to act as the representative of the parts of Boyd and Elliott counties, as well as the county of Carter, in making the compromise, or that bonds are to be issued for the purpose of carrying it out, but all this is matter of detail, suitable to the single purpose the legislature had in view, namely, a settlement and compromise with the holders of bonds issued by Carter county before its division, and for which the present Carter county, and those parts of Boyd and Elliott which were taken from the old county, were liable. It is difficult to see how the subject of the legislation could be stated more clearly, without making the title of the act 'a detailed statement, or an index or abstract, of its contents,' which all agree is not pecessary. Montclair v. Ramsdell, Sup. Ct. Rep. 
3
4
2. The authority of the county court of Carter county to bind 'those parts of the counties of Boyd and Elliott taken from Carter county.' If we understand correctly the position of the county as to this branch of the case, it is that the legislature has no power to authorize the county court of Carter county to act for these parts of counties in compromising the old debt for which they were held, because they were no longer parts of that county, and no opportunity was given them to participate in the arrangement. These parts of counties have no separate organization of their own, corporate or otherwise. For all county purposes, except this debt contracted by Carter county when they were included within its boundaries, they are subject to the government of the counties to which they now respectively belong; but for the debt they still remain a part of Carter. Such is clearly the effect of that provision in the acts establishing the new counties which declared that the liability of citizens and property in the territory set off from Carter, for taxation on account of the bonds and interest, should continue the same 'as though this act had never been passed.' Had the acts never been passed, no one would doubt the power of the legislature to give the county court of Carter the authority to make the settlement in the same way now provided for, even though these parts of the county did not have a justice of the peace in commission to take part in the deliberations. And this because the county court was made the agent of the county, and of those whose property was subject to taxation, for the transaction of this business. The legislature might have appointed a commission for the same purpose, or it might have selected any other suitable agency. In order to bind the county or the tax-payers, it was not necessary that the tax-payers should vote on the subject, or that they should participate in an election of the body that was to act in the matter. All that was properly within the discretion of the legislature. No new debt was to be created, and no new subscription to the stock of a railroad company was to be made. All that had to be done was to compromise and settle an existing debt, and to substitute new liabilities on terms to be agreed on for an old one. Certainly it was within the power of the legislature to designate a suitable agency for that purpose, and what could be more suitable than that department of the governing body of Carter county which was intrusted with the management of its financial affairs? The cases of Allison v. Louisville & H. C. & W. Ry. Co., Bush, 1; Scuffletown Fence Co. v. McAllister, Cypress Pond Draining Co. v. Hooper, and Mercer Co. Court v. Kentucky River Nav. Co., —referred to in the argument of counsel, all relate to the creation of new liabilities, not to the settlement of old ones.
4
5
3. The right to issue negotiable securities. It is no doubt true that without sufficient legislative authority a municipality cannot issue commercial paper which will be free from equitable defenses in the hands of innocent holders, (Claiborne Co. v. Brooks, Sup. Ct. Rep. ) but, in our opinion, that authority was given here. The county of Carter was authorized to borrow money, and to issue its bonds therefor, to pay its subscription to the stock of the railroad company. This, all agree, was sufficient authority to issue bonds which were negotiable, and the averments in the declaration are that the bonds which were in fact issued had that character. The debt to be compromised, therefore, under the act of was a debt which had been created by the issue of such bonds, and the authority was to execute to the 'holders of said bonds and coupons of interest' 'the obligations of said county of Carter, and those parts of the counties of Boyd and Elliott taken from Carter county in their formation, which shall be signed by the county judge of Carter county, and attested by the clerk of said court.' They were to contain such stipulations as to interest, not exceeding 6 per cent. per annum, and to be made due and payable at such times as might be agreed on. As the new obligations were to be executed to take up and cancel old negotiable securities to a large amount, and were to be made payable at a future time, there cannot be a doubt of the intention of the legislature to authorize the execution of 'obligations' negotiable in form and in law, if necessary to secure a settlement. The authority to include in the obligations such stipulations as to interest as might be agreed on clearly implies authority to attach interest coupons, and everything indicates a purpose to invest the court with all the powers as to the form of the obligations that were necessary to enable it to meet the requirements of the holders of the outstanding bonds and coupons in this particular.
5
6
4. The want of parties. As we have already said, the parts of Boyd and Elliott counties which are interested in this matter have no separate organization of their own, and they remain for all the purposes of this debt a part of Carter county. A suit against Carter county on the bonds is therefore a suit against them, and a judgment against that county will be payable out of taxes collected within the boundaries of the original county under the provisions of the act of .
6
7
A suggestion was made in the argument for the county of a variance between the bond described in the declaration and that which was actually issued; but this is a matter which we cannot consider, as there is no copy of the bond as issued in the record.
7
8
Another objection is made to the form of the declaration, in that it does not meet the requirements of section of the Civil Code of Kentucky, and set out distinctly in separate paragraphs each one of the 60 separate causes of action sued on. That objection cannot be taken by general demurrer, and, besides, it does not seem to have been made below.
8
9
The objection to the action of the court in respect to the answer is so little relied on that it is only necessary to say we see no error in what was done.

ACCIDENT INS. CO. OF NORTH AMERICA
v.
CRANDAL.1
March 7, 1887.
1
The refusal of the court to instruct the jury, at the close of the plaintiff's evidence, that she was not entitled to recover, cannot be assigned for error, because the defendant at the time requesting such an instruction, had not rested its case, but afterwards went on and introduced evidence i its own behalf. Grand Trunk Ry. v. Cummings, Sup. Ct. Rep. Bradley v. Poole, The subsequent instructions to the jury were not excepted to. No error is assigned in the previous rulings upon evidence, except in the admission, against the defendant's objection and exception, of evidence tending to prove the insanity of the assured. The only other matter open upon this record is whether the judgment for the plaintiff is supported by the special verdict, which finds that, while the policy was in force, the assured died by hanging himself, being at the time insane, and that due notice and proof of death were afterwards given.
1
2
The single question to be decided, therefore, is whether a policy of insurance against 'bodily injuries, effected through external, accidental, and violent means,' and occasioning death or complete disability to do business, and providing that 'this insurance shall not extend to death or disability which may have been caused wholly or in part by bodily infirmities or disease, or by suicide or self-inflicted injuries,' covers a death by hanging oneself while insane.

The decisions upon the effect of a policy of life insurance which provides that it shall be void if the assured 'shall die by suicide,' or 'shall die by his own hand,' go far towards determining this question. This court, on full consideration of the conflicting authorities upon that subject, has repeatedly and uniformly held that such a provision, not containing the words 'sane or insane,' does not include a self-killing by an insane person, whether his unsoundness of mind is such as to prevent him from understanding the physical nature and consequences of his act, or only such as to prevent him, while foreseeing and premeditating its physical consequences, from understanding its moral nature and aspect. Life Ins. Co. v. Terry, Bigelow v. Berkshire Ins. Co., Insurance Co. v. Rodel, Manhattan Ins. Co. v. Broughton, Sup. Ct. Rep. 99. In the last case, which was one in which the assured hanged himself while insane, the court, repeating the words used by Mr. Justice NELSON when chief justice of New York, said that 'self-destruction by a fellow being bereft of reason can with no more propriety be ascribed to the act of his own hand than to the deadly instrument that may have been used by him for the purpose,' and 'was no more his act, in the sense of the law, than if he had been impelled by irresistible physical force.' Sup. Ct. Rep. Breasted v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 4 Hill, 73. In a like case, Vicechancellor WOOD (since Lord Chancellor HATHERLEY) observed that the deceased was 'subject to that which is really just as much an accident as if he had fallen from the top of a house.' Horn v. Anglo-Australian etc. co., Jur. (N. S.) 673. And in another case Chief Justice APPLETON said that 'the insane suicide no more dies by his own hand than the suicide by mistake or accident,' and that, under such a policy, 'death by the hands of the insured, whether by accident, mistake, or in a fit of insanity, is to be governed by one and the same rule.' Eastabrook v. Union Ins. Co., Many of the cases cited for the plaintiff in error are inconsistent with the settled law of this court, as shown by the decisions above mentioned.
3

In this state of the law there can be no doubt that the assured did not die 'by suicide,' within the meaning of this policy; and the same reasons are conclusive against holding that he died by 'self-inflicted injuries.' If self-killing, 'suicide,' 'dying by his own hand,' cannot be predicated of an insane person, no more can 'self-inflicted injuries;' for in either case it is not his act. Nor does the case come within the clause which provides that the insurance shall not extend to 'death or disability which may have been caused wholly or inp art by bodily infirmities or disease.' If insanity could be considered as coming within this clause, it would be doubtful, to say the least, whether, under the rule of the law of insurance which attributes an injury or loss to its proximate cause only, and in view of the decisions in similar cases, the insanity of the assured, or anything but the act of hanging himself, could be held to be the cause of his death. Scheffer v. Railroad Co., Trew v. Railway Passengers' Assur. Co., and Reynolds v. Accidental Ins. Co., Winspear v. Accident Ins. Co., affirmed, 6 Q. B. Div. 42; Lawrence v. Accidental Ins. Co., Scheiderer v. Travelers' Ins. Co..

But the words 'bodily infirmities or disease' do not include insanity. Although, as suggested by Mr. Justice HUNT, in Life Ins. Co. v. Terry, insanity or unsoundness of mind often, if not always, is accompanied by or results from disease of the body, still, in the common speech of mankind, mental are distinguished from bodily disease. In the phrase 'bodily infirmities or disease,' the word 'bodily' grammatically applies to 'disease' as well as to 'infirmities;' and it cannot but be so applied without disregarding the fundamental rule of interpretation that policies of insurance are to be construed most strongly against the insurers who frame them. The prefix of 'bodily' hardly affects the meaning of 'infirmities,' and it is difficult to conjecture any purpose in inserting it in this proviso other than to exclude mental disease from the enumeration of the causes of death or disability to which the insurance does not extend.
5
6
In the argument for the plaintiff in error, some stress was laid on the fact that the concluding paragraph of the application differs in form of expression so as to include mental as well as bodily diseases. It is by no means clear that this is so; but, if it were, it would not affect the case. The whole application is not made part of the contract, and the only mention of it in the policy is in the opening words, 'In consideration of the warranties made in the application for this insurance.' This does not include all the statements in the application, but only those which are warranties. Some of them may be; others clearly are not. The statements as to the age, occupation, previous state of health, and present habits of the assured, and as to his other insurance, may be warranties on his part. Those as to the amount, terms, and payee of the policy applied for, certainly are not. The statements expressing his understanding of what will be the effect of the insurance are statements not of fact, but of law, and cannot control the legal construction of the policy afterwards issued and accepted.
6
7
The death of the assured not having been the effect of any cause specified in the proviso of the policy, and not coming within any warranty in the application, the question recurs whether it is within the general words of the leading sentence of the policy, by which he is declared to be insured 'against bodily injuries effected through external, accidental, and violent means.' This sentence does not, like the proviso, speak of what the injury is 'caused by,' but it looks only to the 'means' by which it is effected. No one doubts that hanging is a violent means of death. As it affects the body from without, it is external, just as suffocation by drowning was held to be in the Cases of Trew, Reynolds, and Winspear, above cited. And, according to the decisions as to suicide under policies of life insurance, before referred to, it cannot, when done by an insane person, be held to be other than accidental.

8
The result is that the judgment of the circuit court in favor of the plaintiff was correct, and must be affirmed.

120 U.S. 534
FLETCHER and others
v.
FULLER, in His Own Right, and as Trustee, etc.1
March 7, 1887.
1
This is an action of ejectment to recover possession of twenty-seven twenty-eighths undivided parts of a tract of land, containing about 14 acres, situated in the town of Lincoln, formerly Smithfield, in the state of Rhode Island. The plaintiff, a citizen of Connecticut, sues the defendants, citizens of Rhode Island, in his own right, and as trustee for others.
1
2
The declaration contains several counts, all of which, except two, are withdrawn. In these the plaintiff alleges that on the twenty-fifth of October, 1874, he was 'seized and possessed in his demesne, as of fee in his own right and as trustee,' of twenty-seven twenty-eighths undivided parts of the tract of land which is described, and that the defendants on that day and year, with force and arms, entered thereon, and ejected him therefrom, and have ever since withheld the possession, to his damage of $ The two counts differ merely in the description of some of the boundary lines of the tract. The defendants pleaded the general issue and 20 years' possession under the statute of possessions. Upon these pleas issues were joined, and the case was tried; the parties stipulating that the plea of the statute should be held to apply to any period or periods of 20 years that could be covered by any other like plea that might have been filed, and that either party might offer any evidence and rely upon any matters that would be admissible under such plea or pleas, and any proper replications or other proceedings thereon. The case was tried three times, resulting the first time in a verdict for the defendants, and at the other times in a verdict for the plaintiff. The judgment on the last verdict is brought before us for review by the defendants on a writ of error. Numerous exceptions were takeni n the progress of the trial to the rulings of the court in the admission and rejection of evidence, and to the instructions given and refused to the jury; but the conclusions we have reached with respect to the instructions given and refused, as to the presumption of a deed to the ancestors in title of the defendants, render it unnecessary to consider the others.

It appears from the evidence at the trial that the land in controversy was the westerly part of a tract of acres, belonging, in 1750, to one James Reed, and which, by early conveyances, became divided into three parcels, one containing acres, one 5 1/2 acres, and the third 6 acres, as snown by a diagram submitted, by consent of parties, to the jury, of which the following is a reduced copy: A turnpike, running through the tract northerly and southerly, was opened in acre parcel was conveyed to Francis Richardson, of Attleboro, Massachusetts, by deed dated April 10, 1750. The land in controversy is a portion of this parcel lying west of the turnpike. The five and a half acre parcel was conveyed to Ezekiel Fuller by deed dated November 17, 1750. The six-acre parcel was conveyed to Abigail Fuller, wife of Ezekiel, and daughter of Francis Richardson, by deed dated January 21, 1756. $The plaintiff elaims to derive title under the will of Francis Richardson, dated May 26, 1749, and the codicil thereof, dated August 10, 1750, which were admitted to probate in Massachusetts, January 19, 1756. A copy of the will and codicil, and of the Massachusetts probate, was produced and given in evidence, together with a certificate of their having been filed and recorded in the probate office in Lincoln on the twenty-seventh of August, 1881. $It does not appear that there was any direct evidence that Francis Richardson was seized of the acre parcel at the time of his death. The presumption, in the absence of any opposing circumstances, is undoubtedly that, being the owner at the date of the codicil, August 10, 1750, he continued such owner up to the time of his death, which occurred some years afterwards. Whether sufficient opposing circumstances to rebut this presumption are found in the absence of all claim to the land for three-quarters of a century by the devisee or her husband, or her heirs, and the continued claim of ownership by the ancestors in title of the defendants during that period, is a question to be hereafter considered.
3

It is stated in the record that there was evidence tending to show that Abigail Fuller, the devisee, and her husband, entered into possession of the property devised under the will and codicil, but what that evidence was does not appear. Abigail died prior to leaving her husband surviving her. He left Smithfield some time in 1761 'for parts unknown.' It appears, also, that in a deed executed by him on the eleventh of April, 1761, of the 20-acre lot designated on the diagram, he recited that such lot was bounded on the north by 'his former land.' With the exception of the evidence tending to show that the devisee and her husband entered into possession of the property devised, and the reference by the husband in his deed to the tract as his former land, there was nothing to show that any claim of right or title to the land had been made by them, or by their heirs, for nearly three-quarters of a century, either by the exercise of acts of ownership over it, such as its occupation or the use of its products, or by leasing or selling it, or by the payment of taxes, or in any other way. And, for over 40 years after the lapse of the three-quarters of a century, the only claim of title made by the heirs of the devisee to any portion of the acre lot consisted in the fact that in 1835 they brought an action against certain persons, with whom the defendants were not in privity of title or ancestry, for the recovery of another portion of the acre parcel, which action was discontinued in 1838 o account of the poverty and pecuniary inability of the heirs to carry it on; and in the fact that, at varying intervals between as stated in one part of the record,) they had been in the habit, under such claim, of cutting wood thereon openly for family use, and the manufacture of baskets, in which business some of them were engaged, and carrying it to their homes; and that on three occasions, once in 1840, once in 1845, and once in 1852, some of them, in contemplation of taking legal proceedings to establish their title, had gone around and upon the land, and pointed out its boundaries.

When Ezekiel Fuller departed from Smithfiled, in 1761, he left two children, Francis and Abigail, without means of support, and, at a meeting of the town council in September following, proceedings were taken to provide for them. In a resolution reciting that 'Ezekiel is gone, we know not where;' that his children were then and likely to be chargeable to the town; that little or nothing of Ezekiel's estate was to be found to support them, but that it was assumed there was some estate belonging to him,—a person was appointed to make proper inquiry and search for it, 'to know what land there is belonging to the family of said Ezekiel, and secure the same for the support of the children.' It would seem that the person thus appointed, reported that there was a piece of land—a six-acre parcel—which was possessed by Ezekiel in right of his wife; for the town council, at a meeting in March, 1776, after reciting that there was nothing of said Fuller's estate left behind to maintain his children but a small piece of land, and that no provision for their support could be had without the favor and authority of the general assembly to sell and give a deed of it, appointed one Edward Mowry to lay the matter before the assembly, and request that it would pass an act to enable some proper person to dispose of the parcel, and clothe him with authority to give a deed thereof. Mowry presented a proper petition to the assembly, which granted the prayer, and empowered the town treasurer, with the consent and advice of the town council, to sell the land, and apply the money received for the purpose stated; that is, the support of the children. A sale of the six-acre lot for 30 was accordingly made by the town treasurer under the authority thus conferred.

Abigail, the wife of Ezekiel, left five children surviving her, all of whom died before their father except Abigail, Jr., who was one of the two supported by the town. The father, who disappeared from Smithfield in 1761, died in the poor-house in Attleboro, Massachusetts, in 1800. Abigail, the daughter, was born December 29, 1757; became of age, December 29, 1778; and was married to Benjamin Fuller, December 1, 1779. He died in 1832, and she died in 1835 intestate. The plaintiff is the grandson of this Abigail, and the parties for whom he is trustee are her other descendants. They all derive whatever title they have from her.
6
7
On the twenty-fourth of May, 1874, a century and eighteen years after the probate of the will of Francis Richardson, all the heirs of Abigail Fuller, except one, executed a power of attorney to Theodore C. Fuller, also one of said heirs, authorizing him to sell to Nathan Fuller, the plaintiff in this action, all their title and interest in the tract conveyed by James Reed to Francis Richardson by deed dated April 10, 1750, and devised to Elizabeth Fuller, wife of Ezekiel, by his last will and testament probated January 19, 1976, to hold the same upon trust to prosecute to final conclusion legal proceedings necessary to recover possession of the premises, to employ counsel for the purpose, to conduct the proceedings, and to make such compromises of the grantors' claims as to him and his counsel might seem best. The same grantors, by their attorney, on the same day, executed a deed of the same tract of land to Nathan Fuller, reciting a consideration of $10, upon trusts similar to thos contained in the power of attorney. Both documents were duly acknowledged by the grantors. The delivery of the deed was made by the attorney in this way: He and the grantee went upon the land with three other persons, and while upon it he delivered the deed to the grantee. He also took up some earth in his hands, and passed it to the grantee. This he had been instructed to do by his counsel as the form of delivering possession. The parties were about 15 minutes on the land. There was no evidence of any notice to or knowledge by the defendants of these acts, and they testified that they had neither. This is the case of the plaintiff, briefly stated.
7

The defendants trace their title to the land in question by continuous claim of title from a deed of the acre parcel, made by one Jeremiah Richardson, a grandson of the testator, Francis Richardson, to Stephen Jencks, dated April 8, 1768, containing full covenants of title and warranty, and recorded in the records of Smithfield on July 10th following. Jeremiah Richardson was the son of Francis Richardson, who was a son of the testator, and is named in the will as having died. Jeremiah had a brother also called Francis Richardson, who died prior to March, 1766. Stephen Jencks, by deed dated August 12, 1796, containing full covenants of warranty, to secure several notes, amounting to $ mortgaged the land in controversy, with adjoining lands to which he had acquired title, making in all 50 acres; of which the 20-acre lot designated on the diagram was one parcel, which he had purchased in and the 6-acre lot, also designated on the diagram, was another parcel, which he had purchased in 1768 for 45. He died in 1800, leaving a will, by which he devised his real estate in Smithfield and elsewhere to his children. Stephen Jencks, Jr., his son, acquired the interests of the other heirs, and by deed dated May 18, 1804, conveyed the whole, including by specific description the land in controversy, to his brother, Jerahmael Jencks, who was the grandfather and ancestor in title of the defendants. Other portions of the acre parcel were conveyed by ancestors in title of the defendants, by deeds to different parties, containing full covenants of title and warranty, dated, respectively, April 12, 1841, December 3, 1845, and May 21, 1860, and they entered into possession of the respective parcels, and inclosed and improved them. In May, 1864, the father of the defendants, from whom they derive their title, surveyed and platted into town lots the remaining portion of that parcel, being the land in controversy. In the partition of the estate of the grandfather, Jerahmael Jencks, between his heirs at law, in 1824, this land had been taken by him as part of his estate, and platted as such in the partition plat. He died in 1866.
8

The land was not inclosed on the line of the turnpike. In a fence was put up on the westerly side by an adjoining owner. On the southerly side there was at one time a fence running from the turnpike westerly to the other side of the ledge hereafter mentioned, but it disappeared in 1835. On the notherly line there was only a brush-fence until when a purchaser of adjoining land erected one. The land has never been put under cultivation. Prior to it was covered with wood, and every year from the ancestors of the defendants cut wood upon it for family use. In the father of the defendants cut and applied to his use all the wood of value then remaining. The land had an extensive ledge of rock running across its center from north to south, which was opened by defendants' ancestors as early as large quantities of stone were quarried and sold by them to railroad companies; and from that time down to the trial, with longer or shorter intervals, never of more than a year or two, the ledge was worked more or less extensively by the defendants or their ancestors in title, or their lessees and tenants, and the stone removed. There is no evidence h at any other person had ever worked the ledge, or taken stone off the land, or attempted to do so. The father of the defendants put up a sign on the land, stating that all persons were forbidden from taking wood or stone from it. In his lessee built a barn and tool-shed on the land near the ledge, for his use in quarrying; these structures being in full view from Broad street, formerly the turnpike. He also dug a well, from which he obtained water for his business. The barn, with lofts for hay, was of sufficient capacity 'to accommodate, and did accommodate, six or eight horses, or more.' It remained on the land, with some additions, until some time in 1869, when it was removed by the lessee. The land was assessed for taxes to the ancestors in title of the defendants, and paid by them, for 20 years, between The tax-lists for the other years up to could not be found. From to the time of the trial, a period of 77 years, the land was assessed to them, and the taxes were paid by them. The statute or Rhode Island respecting the assessment of taxes, in force between required the assessors to assess taxes on real estate to persons who held and occupied it, and the one in force between required them to assess the taxes to those who held and occupied it, or to the owners thereof, and the one in force after to the owners thereof. No taxes were ever assessed to the Fullers, or paid by them. Neither plaintiff nor defend ants, nor their ancestors, ever resided on the premises, and the land was occupied and possessed by the ancestors in title of the defendants only in the way mentioned.
9
10
Upon the case thus presented, and we have not omitted, we think, any material circumstance in the statement, the defendants asked an instruction to the jury as to the presumption they might make of a lost grant to their ancestor in title, which the court refused. Its charge was thus: 'Of course, gentlemen, if you find that you can presume a grant, if you find from the testimony that there was a lost deed which passed from Abigail Fuller to Jeremiah Richardson, or to Francis Richardson, and the property was inherited by Jeremiah, so that Jeremiah had a good title to covery to Stephen Jencks, that makes the title of the defendants here complete. * * * But, gentlemen, you are to look into the evidence upon this question of a grant, and, if the evidence in favor of the presumption is overcome by the evidence against such a grant, then, of course, you will not presume one. It is a question of testimony.'
10
11
The defendants requested the court to instruct the jury 'that the presumption they were authorized to make of a lost deed was not necessarily restricted to what may fairly be supposed to have occurred, but rather to what may have occurred and seems requisite to quiet title in the possessor.' This instruction the court refused to give, or to modify its charge in conformity with it. The defendants now contend that the court thus erred, its charge being, in effect, that, in order to presume a lost deed, the jury must be satisfied that such a deed had in fact actually existed. Such seems to us to be the purport of the charge, and therein there was error.
11
12
In such cases, 'presumptions,' as said by Sir WILLIAM GRANT, 'do not always proceed on a belief that the thing presumed has actually taken place. Grants are frequently presumed, as Lord MANSFIELD says, merely from a principle, and for the purpose of quieting the possession. There is as much occasion for presuming conveyances of legal estates; as otherwise titles must often be imperfect, and in many cases unavailable, when from length of time it has become impossible to discover in whom the legal estate (if outstanding) is already vested.' Hillary v. Waller, Eldridge v. Knott, Cowp. 
12
13
The owners of property, especially if it be valuable and available, do not often allow it to remain in the quiet and unquestioned enjoyment f others. Such a course is not in accordance with the ordinary conduct of men. When, therefore, possession and use are long continued, they create a presumption of lawful origin; that is, that they are founded upon such instruments and proceedings as in law would pass the right to the possession and use of the property. It may be, in point of fact, that permission to occupy and use was given orally, or upon a contract of sale with promise of a future conveyance, which parties have subsequently neglected to obtain, or the conveyance executed may not have been acknowledged so as to be recorded, or may have been mislaid or lost. Many circumstances may prevent the execution of a deed of conveyance to which the occupant of land is entitled, or may lead to its loss after being executed. It is a matter of almost daily experience that reconveyances of property, transferred by the owners upon conditions or trusts, are often delayed after the conditions are performed or the trusts discharged, simply because of the pressure of other engagements, and a conviction that they can be readily obtained at any time.
13
14
The death of parties may leave in the hands of executors or heirs papers constituting muniments of title, of the value of which the latter may have no knowledge, and therefore for the preservation and record of which may take no action; and thus the documents may be deposited in places exposed to decay and destruction. Should they be lost, witnesses of their execution, or of contracts for their execution, may not be readily found, or, if found, time may have so impaired their recollection of the transactions that they can only be imperfectly recalled, and of course imperfectly stated. The law, in tenderness to the infirmities of human nature, steps in, and by reasonable presumptions that acts to protect one's rights which might have been done, and in the ordinary course of things generally would be done, have been done, in the particular case under consideration, affords the necessary protection against possible failure to obtain or preserve the proper muniments of title, and avoids the necessity of relying upon the fallible memory of witnesses, when time may have dimmed their recollection of past transactions, and thus gives peace and quiet to long and uninterrupted possessions.
14
15
The rule of presumption, in such cases, as has been well said, is one of policy, as well as of convenience, and necessary for the peace and security of society. 'Where one uses an easement whenever he sees fit, without asking leave and without objection,' says the supreme court of Pennsylvania, 'his adverse and uninterrupted enjoyment for twenty-one years is a title which cannot afterwards be disputed. Such enjoyment, without evidence to explain how it began, is presumed to have been in pursuance of a full and unqualified qualified grant.' Garrett v. Jackson, The same presumption will arise whether the grant relate to corporeal or incorporeal hereditaments. As said by this court in Ricard v. Williams, speaking by Mr. Justice STORY: 'A grant of land may as well be presumed as a grant of a fishery, or of a common, or of a way. Presumptions of this nature are adopted from the general infirmity of human nature, the difficulty of preserving muniments of title, and the public policy of supporting long and uninterrupted possessions. They are founded upon the consideration that the facts are such as could not, according to the ordinary course of human affairs, occur, unless there was a transmutation of title to, or an admission of an existing adverse title in, the party in possession.'
15
16
It is not necessary, therefore, in the cases mentioned, for the jury, in order to presume a conveyance, to believe that a conveyance was in point of fact executed. It is sufficient if the evidence leads to the conclusion that the conveyance might have been executed, and that its existence would be a solution of the difficulties arising from its non-executin . In Edson v. Munsell, which was an action for obstructing the enjoyment of an easement, the doctrine of acquiring such rights by prescription or adverse possession is elaborately considered; and it is there said that 'the fiction of presuming a grant from twenty years' possession or use was invented by the English courts in the eighteenth century to avoid the absurdities of their rule of legal memory, and was derived by analogy from the limitation prescribed by the statute of 21 Jac. I, c. 21, for actions of ejectment. It is not founded on a belief that a grant has actually been made in the particular case, but on the general presumption that a man will naturally enjoy what belongs to him, the difficulty of proof after lapse of time, and the policy of not disturbing longcontinued possessions.'
16
17
In Casey's Lesses v. Inloes, 1 Gill, which was an action of ejectment, the court of appeals of Maryland held that, where there had been a continuous possession of land for 20 years or upwards, by a party, or persons claiming under him, the court was authorized to instruct the jury, in the absence of a deed to such party, to presume that one had been executed to him. It also approved the refusal of the court below to instruct the jury that before they could find a title in the defendants, or any one of them, by presumption of a grant by the plaintiff or those under whom he claims, they must believe on their consciences, and find as a fact, that such grant was actually made. 'The granting of such a prayer,' said the court, 'would have a tendency to misiead the jury, by inducing them to believe that a presumption of a grant could not be made unless the jury in point of fact believed in the execution of the grant; whereas it is frequently the duty of the jury to find such presumption as an inference of law, although in their consciences they may disbelieve the actual execution of any such grant.'
17
18
In Williams v. donell, which was also an action of ejectment, the supreme court of Tennessee, speaking on the same point, said: 'It is not indispensable, in order to lay a proper foundation for the legal presumption of a grant, to establish the probability of the fact that in reality a grant ever issued. It will be a sufficient ground for the presumption to show that by legal possibility a grant might have issued, and, this appearing, it may be assumed, in the absence of circumstances repelling such conclusions, that all that might lawfully have been done to perfect the legal title was in fact done, and in the form prescribed by law.'
18
19
In accordance with the doctrine thus explicitly declared, there can be no doubt that the court below should have instructed the jury as requested. It would seem from the instruction given that the deed which the defendants inisted might be presumed was one from Ezekiel and Abigail Fuller, or from Abigail Fuller to Jeremiah Richardson. We think, however, that the facts point with equal directness to a conveyance from his grandfather. The codicil to his will, by which he devised the property to his married daughter, was dated several years before his death, and there was no evidence that he was seized of it at that time, except the presumption arising from his having once possessed it. It does not appear that either the devisee or her husband ever exercised any acts of ownership in any way, or ever claimed to own it. After he left Smithfield, two of his children were supported by the town; and the agent of the town, appointed to search for any property belonging to the father, from the sale of which the children might be supported, reported that there was only the six-acre parcel, which was held by him in the right of his wife. He afterwards went to the poor-house, where he died in 1800. During the 39 years after he left Smithfield, and notwithstanding his having been part of that time in the poor-house, no word appears to have come from him asserting that he had any interesti n the property. It is difficult to reconcile his conduct or that of his wife, the devisee, if in truth the testator continued the owner of the property until his death, and it passed under the codicil to his will. While Ezekiel Fuller was still living, and for several years after he had left Smithfield, Jeremiah Richardson, the testator's grandson, asserted ownership of the tract by its sale to Stephen Jencks by a deed with covenants of title and warranty, which was recorded in the town records. No word of opposition to this sale, or to the subsequent mortgage of the property by the grantee, was ever made, so far as the record discloses. The fact that Jeremiah Richardson was a minor when his grandfather died does not militate against the presumption of a deed to him. Nothing would be more natural than a deed of gift from the grandfather to the grandson. It would also seem from the charge of the court that in the deed from Jeremiah to Jencks he recited that the property had come from his honored grandfather, or words to that effect.
19
20
If, however, the evidence which, as the record says, tended to show that the devisee and her husband entered into the possession of the property devised, and the recital in his deed of April 11, 1761, of the 20-acre parcel, that it was bounded on the north by his former land, can be considered as rebutting the presumption of such a deed by the testator, then the defendants may fall back on the presumption of a deed to Jeremiah Richardson by Ezekiel and Abigail Fuller, the devisee, and her husband. There is nothing in the conduct or language of either of these parties which in any way repels such a presumption. Their silence and non-claim of the property would rather indicate that they had parted with their interest. The minority of Jeremiah at the time only shows his inability to purchase the property; but those under whose charge he was, could have purchased it for him, and had the deed executed to him. His orphanage may have induced such a proceeding. We do not, therefore, think that his minority at the time can be urged against the presumption of a deed to him.
20
21
For the refusal of the court below to give the instruction requested, the case must go back for a new trial. We will add, moreover, that though a presumption of a deed is one that may be rebutted by proof of facts inconsistent with its supposed existence, yet where no such facts are shown, and the things done, and the things omitted, with regard to the property in controversy, by the respective parties, for long periods of time after the execution of the supposed conveyance, can be explained satisfactorily only upon the hypothesis of its existence, then the jury may be instructed that it is their duty to presume such a conveyance, and thus quiet the possession. How long a period must elapse after the date of the supposed conveyance before it may be presumed to have existed has not always been a matter of easy determination.

'In general,' said this court, speaking by Mr. Justice STORY, 'it is the policy of courts of law to limit the presumption of grants to periods analogous to those of the statute of limitations in cases where the statute does not apply. But when the statute applies, it constitutes ordinarily a sufficient title or defense independently of any presumption of a grant, and therefore it is not generally resorted to. But, if the circumstances of the case justify it, a presumption of a grant may as well be made in the one case as in the other; and, when the other circumstances are very cogent and full, there is no absolute bar against the presumption of a grant within a period short of the statute of limitations.' Ricard v. Williams. 
22
23
The general statement of the doctrine, as we have seen from the authorities cited, is that the presumption of a grant is indulged merely to quiet a long possession which might otherwise be disturbed by reason of the inability of the possessor to produce the muniments of title which e re actually given at the time of the acquisition of the property by him or those under whom he claims, but have been lost, or which he or they were entitled to have at that time, but had neglected to obtain, and of which the witnesses have passed away, or their recollection of the transaction has become dimmed and imperfect; and hence, as a general rule, it is only where the possession has been actual, open, and exclusive for the period prescribed by the statute of limitations to bar an action for the recovery of land, that the presumption of a deed can be invoked. But the reason for attaching such weight to a possession of this character is the notoriety it gives to the claim of the occupant; and, in countries where land is generally occupied or cultivated, it is the most effective mode of asserting ownership. But, as Mr. Justice STORY observes in delivering the opinion of this court in Green v. Liter, 'In the simplicity of ancient times there were no means of ascertaining titles but by the visible seizin, and, indeed, there was no other mode between subjects of passing title but livery of the land itself by the symbolical delivery of turf and twig. The moment that a tenant was thus seized he had a perfect investiture, and, if ousted, could maintain his action for the pealty, although he had not been long enough in possession even to tonch the esplees. The very object of the rule, therefore, was notoriety; to prevent frauds upon the land, and upon the other tenants.' There may be acts equally notorious, and therefore equally evincive of ownership, which, taken in connection with a long possession, even if that possession has been subject to occasional intrusion, are as fully suggestive of rightful origin as an uninterrupted possession. Where any proprietary right is exercised for a long period, which, if not founded upon a lawful origin, would in the usual conrse of things be resisted by parties interested, and no such resistance is made, a presumption may be indulged that the proprietary right had a lawful origin. The principle is thus stated by Mr. Justice STEPHEN, of the high court justice of England, in his Digest of the Law of Evidence, using the term 'grant' in a general sense, as indicating a conveyance of real property, whether corporeal or incorporeal: 'When it has been shown that any person has, for a long period of time, exercised any proprietary right which might have had a lawful origin by grant or license from the crown, or from a private person, and the exercise of which might and naturally would have been prevented by the persons interested, if it had not had a lawful origin, there is a presumption that such right had a lawful origin, and that it was created by a proper instrument which has been lost.' Article .
23
24
This presumption may therefore, in some instances, be properly invoked where a proprietary right has long been exercised, although the exclusive possession of the whole property to which the right is asserted may have been occasionally interrupted during the period necessary to create a title by adverse possession, if in addition to the actual possession, there were other open acts of ownership. If the interruptions did not impair the uses to which the possessor subjected the property, and for which it was chiefly valuable, they should not necessarily be held to defeat the presumption of the rightful origin of his claim to which the facts would otherwise lead. It is a matter which, under proper instructions, may be left to the jury.
24
25
In the present case, acts of ownership over the property in controversy by the ancestors in title of the defendants, so far as they could be manifested by written transfers of it, either as conveyances of title or by way of security, were exercised from for more than a century. The first conveyance, from which the defendants trace their title, was duly recorded in the land records of the town soon after its execution in that year. The assessment of taxes on the property of those ancestors, and their payment of the taxes for 20 years between and the assessment of taxes to them or to the defendants for 77 years after and the payment of the taxes by them, such assessment being required to be made, under the laws of the state, to occupants or owners of the land, are circumstances of great significance, taken in connection with their constantly asserted ownership. In Ewing v. Burnet this court speaks of the uninterrupted payment of taxes on a lot for 24 consecutive years as 'powerful evidence of claim of right to the whole lot.' 11 Pet. 54. Here, as seen, the taxes were uninterruptedly paid by the defendants or their ancestors in title for a much longer period.
25
26
In St. Louis Public Schools v. Risley's Heirs the supreme Court of Missouri said: 'Payment of taxes has been admitted in questions of adverse possession, and may have an important bearing, as it is not usual for one owning realty to neglect paying taxes for a period which would be sufficient to constitute a bar under the statute of limitations, or for one to pay taxes having no claim or color of title.' .
26
27
In Davis v. Easley, which was an action of ejectment, the supreme court of Illinois held that receipts for taxes paid by the plaintiff were admissible, and said: 'The payment of taxes indicated that the plaintiff claimed title to the whole tract. It likewise tended to explain the character and extent of his possession.' .
27
28
In this case the ancestors of the defendants entered upon the land under claim of title, and opened and worked the ledge of rock running through it as early as and from they or their tenants or lessees continued, with occasional intervals, to work that ledge to the time of trial, in 1882, a period of 36 years; and it does not appear that during that time any one ever interfered with their work, or complained of it. To constitute an adverse possession, it was not necessary that they should have actually occupied or inclosed the land. It was sufficient that they subjected it to such uses as it was susceptible of, to the exclusion of others. Ellicott v. Pearl, That subjection might be shown by the quarrying of the ledge and the removal of the stone without disturbance or complaint from any quarter. The exclusive working of the quarry, under claim of title to the whole tract by virtue of conveyances in which it was described, might operate in law to carry the possession over the whole; and the payment of taxes thereon might authorize the jury to infer a continuous possession of the whole, notwithstanding any temporary and occasional intrusion by others upon a different part of the tract, which did not interfere with the work.
28
29
The entry of the plaintiff with the attorney of his co-heirs, in 1874, and the delivery of the deed to him with a handful of earth, if weight and consideration are to be given to that proceeding under the circumstances in which it was made, would only reduce the period of undisturbed possession to 28 years. The cutting of wood on a different portion of the land by the Fullers for family use, or the manufacture of baskets, at occasional intervals during a portion of this period, though competent for the consideration of the jury, was not necessarily an interruption to the peacable occupation of the land, so far as quarrying of the ledge and the removal of the stone were concerned, to which uses the defendants and their ancestors in title subjected it, and which appear to have constituted its principal value. Nor did it necessarily change the legal effect of the possession for quarrying the ledge with the attendant claim to the whole tract.
29
30
In Webb v. Richardson, the supreme court of Vermont, in speaking of interruptions in the actual occupancy of real property as affecting the claim of continuous possession, said: 'To constitute a continuous possession, it is not necessary that the occupant should be actually upon the premise continually. The mere fact that time intervenes between successive acts of occupancy does not necessarily destroy the continuity of the possession. The kind and frequency of the acts of occupancy necessary to constitute a continuous possession depend somewhat on the condition of the property, and the uses to which it is adapted in reference to the circumstances and situation of the possessor, and partly on his intention. If, in the intermediate time between the different acts of occupancy, there is no existing intention to continue the possession, or to return to the enjoyment of the premises, the possession, if it has not ripened into a title, terminates, and cannot afterwards be connected with a subsequent occupation so as to be made available towards gaining title; while such continual intention might, and generally would, preserve the possession unbroken.' That was an action of trespass for cutting timber on the land of the plaintiff, who was in possession at the time, and offered testimony to prove that his possession was earlier than the defendant's, and also that he had acquired the land by 15 years' adverse possession. The defendant did not show a chain of title back to the original proprietor of the land, but showed that his grantors entered into possession in 1835, and cut timber and claimed to own the land; and it was held that the question whether this entry interrupted the plaintiff's possession should have been submitted to the jury under proper instructions, in connection with the plaintiff's evidence of continuous possession under those through whom he claimed, and that it was error to refuse to submit it.
30
31
Our conclusion is that the claim to the land in controversy by the defendants and their ancestors in title for over a century, with the payment of taxes thereon, and acts of ownership suited to the condition of the property, and its actual use for 36 or 28 years, it matters not which, would justify a presumption of a deed to the original ancestor, Jeremiah Richardson, to quiet the possession of the defendants claiming under him, and the jury should have been permitted to presume such a deed without finding from the testimony that there was in point of fact a deed which was lost. If the execution of a deed was established, nothing further would be required than proof of its contents; there would be no occasion for the exercise of any presumption on the subject. It is only where there is uncertainty on this point that the presumption is indulged to quiet the possession.

The judgment of the court below must be reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial.

PEOPLE'S SAV. BANK and another
v.
BATES and others.
March 7, 1887.
1
This is an action of replevin involving conflicting claims under certain chattel mortgages executed by Freedman Bros. & Co. formerly merchants in the city of Detroit. The firm was composed of Herman Freedman, who managed its business in Detroit; Benjamin Freedman, who resided in New York, and had entire charge of the buying and of the firm's financial affairs in that city; and Rosa Freedman. At the beginning of the action the mortgaged property was in the custody of Leopold Freud as agent of the People's Savings Bank, plaintiff in error.
1
2
Bates, Rred & Cooley, the defendants in error, who were the plaintiffs below, claim priority under a mortgage given by Freedman Bros. & Co., February 7, 1881, to secure both the past indebtedness of the latter, amounting to $and upwards, for goods, wares, and merchandise sold and money loaned to them, and any future liabilities which might be incurred by the mortgagors for other goods purchased, or other moneys borrowed, from the mortgagees; the mortgage covering not only the goods, wares, merchandise, and other personal property then in the mortgagors' stores in Detroit, but also their notes, book-accounts, and securities, and all future additions to or substitutions for such goods and merchandise. o part of said indebtedness was created at the time of the execution of the mortgage.

3
The People's Savings Bank claims under a mortgage made by Freedman Bros. & Co. on the eleventh of February, 1881, to secure certain demand notes, aggregating $ which were executed by that firm on the seventh day of February, 1881, and also 'all other paper indorsed' by it and held by the bank; that mortgage covering all the goods and merchandise then in the mortgagors' stores, and all thereafter put into them. This last mortgage provided that Leopold Freud, the bank's agent, should take immediate possession and sell the goods in the ordinary course of business, applying the proceeds to said indebtedness until the same was paid. The said demand notes represented past indebtedness; for they were given in place of other paper of the mortgagors' then outstanding, and which had not then matured. Each demand note was accompanied by a cognovit or 'confession of judgment,' under which, however, no action was taken. The mortgage to the bank was the first one filed in the proper office in Detroit, though it was not lodged until after the bank had notice, through its agent, that Bates, Reed & Cooley claimed to be in possession of or to have rights in the mortgaged property. Whether the bank, before the mortgage to it was given, had actual notice of the prior mortgage to Bates, Reed & Cooley does not clearly appear.

By the statutes of Michigan relating to chattel mortgages it is provided that 'every mortgage, or conveyance intended to operate as a mortgage, of goods and chattels, which shall hereafter be made, which shall not be accompanied by an immediate delivery, and followed by an actual and continued change of possession, of the things mortgaged, shall be absolutely void as against the creditors of the mortgagor, and as against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith, unless the mortgage, or a true copy thereof, shall be filed in the office of the township clerk of the township, or city clerk of the city, or city recorder of cities having no officer known as city clerk, where the mortgagor resides, except when the mortgagor is a non-resident of the state, when the mortgage, or a true copy thereof, shall be filed in the office of the township clerk of the township, or city clerk of the city, or city recorder of cities having no officer known as city clerk, where the property is.' 2 How.

e HARLAN, after stating the facts in the foregoing language, delivered the opinion of the court:
8
9
The mortgagees, respectively, insist that there was, within the meaning of the statute, an immediate delivery to them, followed by an actual and continued change of possession of the things mortgaged; the bank claiming to have taken possession under its mortgage on the eleventh of February, 1881, while Bates, Reed & Cooley, denying that the bank ever had such possession as the law requires, contend that they took possession on the fifteenth of February, 1881. But the claim of neither party in that respect is satisfactorily sustained by the proof. The evidence does not show such open, visible, and substantial change of possession as the law required in order to give notice to the public of a change of ownership. Doyle v. Stevens, 4 Mich. 93. In a sense, both parties were in possession by agents early on the morning of the fifteenth of February, each claiming the exclusive right to manage and control the property under the terms of the respective mortgages. As the contest for such management and control was likely to result in an unseemly display of force, the parties, on that day, entered into an agreement which recited their respective claims of priority both of possession and of right, and provided, 'neither party waiving or surrendering any right or advantage,' that the possession of each should remain as it then a s, and that the business should continue as it was then being conducted; all the proceeds of sale being deposited in bank, and remaining there intact until these conflicting claims should be settled by judicial decision or by agreement. The claims were not settled by agreement; and the defendants in error, having insisted that this arrangement was not being carried out in good faith, and having been refused exclusive possession brought this action, as they might do consistently with the agreement, to obtain a judicial determination of their rights. In adopting that course, they surrendered no right they had in the premises.
9
10
In behalf of the bank it is contended that the mortgage to Bates, Reed & Cooley was fraudulent as against subsequent creditors and mortgagees in good faith, in that the mortgagees contemplated that the mortgagors should remain in possession, and prosecute the business in the ordinary mode. The mortgage of February 7, 1881, certainly contains no provision of that kind. But if the extrinsic evidence establishes that such a course upon the part of Freedman Bros. & Co. was in fact contemplated by Bates, Reed & Cooley, it would only show that the mortgagees were willing to give the mortgagors an opportunity to avoid a suspension of their business and bankruptcy; the additions to the stock in trade being bought under the mortgage, so as to compensate the mortgagees for any diminution in value by reason of goods disposed of in the usual course of business. If the mortgage had, in terms, made provision for such a course upon the part of the mortgagors, as the bank contends was in the contemplation of the mortgagees, it would not be held, as matter of law, to be absolutely void or fraudulent as to other creditors. Oliver v. Eaton, Gay v. Bidwell, Id. People v. Bristol, Wingler v. Sibley, Id. Robinson v. Elliott, The good faith of such transactions, where they are not void upon their face, is, under the statutes of Michigan, a question of fact for the determination of the jury. Oliver v. Eaton and Gay v. Bidwell. That rule does not, however, restrict the power of the court to give to the jury a peremptory instruction covering such an issue, when the evidence is all on one side, or so overwhelmingly on one side as to leave no room to doubt what the fact is. In this case there is an entire absence of any evidence impeaching the good faith of Bates, Reed & Cooley in procuring the mortgage of February 7, 1881. There is nothing whatever to show that they had any purpose to commit a fraud, or to put their mortgagors in such a position that the latter could more readily deceive or defraud other creditors.
10
11
Besides, as the court below held upon this branch of the case, the bank, in its capacity as a creditor at large, is not entitled to attack the prior mortgage as fraudulent upon the grounds just stated. This general proposition is conceded by counsel; the usual way, he admits, being for the creditor who has no particular claim in the property to acquire a specific interest therein through the levy of an attachment or execution. Hence he says that, while it is often stated that conveyances of this sort are void as to creditors generally, they must put their claims in the form of a judgment or attachment before they are in a position to attack them; the object of the attachment or execution being to bring the attacking party into privity with the property. And such seems to be the rule recognized by the supreme court of Michigan. In Feary v. Cummings, N. W. Rep. the court, construing a somewhat similar statute, said: 'If the mortgage was made with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, (Comp. Laws, § ) or, inasmuch as the possession was not altered, if it was not put on file prior to plaintiffs becoming creditors, it was invalid as against them; the law being that those who became creditors while the mortgage is not fie d are protected, and not merely those who obtain judgments or levy attachment before the filing. Still one, as creditor at large, can question the mortgage. He can only do that by means of some process or proceeding against the property. Section ' In that case the court cites Thompson v. Van Vechten, in which it was held, in reference to a somewhat similar statute, that 'the mortgage cannot be legally questioned until the creditor clothes himself with a judgment and execution, or with some legal process, against his property; for creditors cannot interfere with the property of their debtor without process.'
11
12
But it is argued that this rule does not apply in the case of a creditor who is a second mortgagee in possession. Such possession, it is claimed, gives him the right, by way of defense, and without resorting to attachment and before obtaining judgment, to assert the invalidity of the prior mortgage. There is some apparent support to this position in Putnam v. Reynolds, N. W. Rep. That was a suit in equity brought to foreclose a chattel mortgage not filed until after the mortgagor had become insolvent, and while his estate was being disposed of by an assignee for the benefit of creditors. The court said that there was reason to believe that the mortgagor acted in bad faith; that the mortgage was left off the record for the purpose of giving the mortgagor a credit to which he was not entitled; in which case the mortgage was void in fact, irrespective of the statute. Upon this ground alone the court declined to give the relief asked, remitting the mortgagee to his remedy, if any he had, at law. It expressly declined to decide whether the rule that creditors cannot attack a mortgage, except indirectly, through a seizure of the property by attachment or other suitable process, applies where the mortgage was originally valid, but is made void by the subsequent neglect of the mortgagee. The case in hand cannot be brought within the principle announced in Putnam v. Reynolds, for the reason, if there were no other, that there was no fraud in fact upon the part of Bates, Reed & Cooley, nor any unreasonable delay in filing the mortgage of February 7, 1881. It was filed shortly after the mortgage to the bank was lodged for record.
12
13
This disposes of all the material questions in the case preliminary to the main inquiry, whether the bank—the mortgage to it having been really given to secure past indebtedness of the mortgagors—is, in the meaning of the statute, a subsequent 'mortgagee in good faith.' If not, the mere filing of the mortgage of February 11, 1881, before that of February 7, 1881, did not give it priority of right over Bates, Reed & Cooley, and the mortgage that was in fact first executed and delivered must be held to give priority of right.
13
14
In Kohl v. Lynn, the supreme court of Michigan said that 'the statute which makes a mortgage of chattels, which has not been recorded, void against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith, uses those terms in the sense which has always been attached to them by judicial decisions.' Guided by this rule, which we deem a sound one, we concur with the court below in holding that the words 'mortgagee in good faith' mean the same thing as 'mortgagee for a valuable consideration without notice.'
14
15
It is insisted that the principles announced in Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, and Railroad Co. v. National Bank, sustain the proposition that the bank was a mortgagee in good faith, although the mortgage to it may be held to have been given merely as security for past indebtedness. The general doctrine announced in Swift v. Tyson was that one who becomes the holder of negotiable paper, before its maturity, in the usual course of business, and in payment of an existing debt, is to be deemed to have received it for a valuable consideration, and is therefore unaffected by any equities existing between antecedent partie. In that case Mr. Justice STORY said that the rule was applicable as well when the negotiable instrument was received as security for as when received in payment of a pre-existing debt. In Railroad Co. v. National Bank it was held, conformably to the recognized usages of the commercial world, that 'the transfer before maturity of negotiable paper as security for an antecedent debt merely, without other circumstances, if the paper be so indorsed that the holder becomes a party to the instrument, although the transfer is without express agreement by the creditor for indulgence, is not an improper use of such paper, and is as much in the usual course of commercial business as its transfer in payment of such debt. In either case, the bona fide holder is unaffected by equities or defenses between prior parties of which he had no notice.'
15
16
Do these principles apply to the case of a chattel mortgage given merely as security for a pre-existing debt, and in obtaining which the mortgagee has neither parted with any right or thing of substance, nor come under a binding agreement to postpone or delay the collection of his demand? Upon principle, and according to the weight of authority, this question must be answered in the negative. The rules established, in the interests of commerce, to facilitate the negotiation of mercantile paper, which, for all practical purposes, passes by delivery as money, and is the representative of money, ought not, in reason, to embrace instruments conveying or transferring real or personal property as security for the payment of money. At any rate, there is nothing in the usages of merchants, as shown in this record, or so far as disclosed in the adjudged cases, indicating that the necessities of commerce require that chattel mortgages be placed upon the same footing in all respects as negotiable securities which have come to the hands of a bona fide holder for value before their maturity. Such a result, if desirable, must be attained by legislation, rather than by judicial decisions.
16
17
One of the earliest cases in the federal courts upon this subject is that of Morse v. Godfrey, It there appeared that one Reed mortgaged to Godfrey all stock in trade, and nearly all his real estate. The latter subsequently mortgaged the same property to a bank. In a contest between the bank and the assignee in bankruptcy of Reed, the former claimed to be a bona fide purchaser for value, without notice of the invalidity, under the bankrupt law, of the mortgages to Godfrey. Mr. Justice STORY said: 'This leads me to remark that the bank does not stand within the predicament of being a bona fide purchaser for a valuable consideration, without notice, in the sense of the rule upon this subject. The bank did not pay any consideration therefor, nor did it surrender any securities or release any debt due either from Reed or Godfrey to it. The transfer from Godfrey was a simple collateral security, taken as additional security for the old indebtment and liability of the parties to the notes described in the instrument of transfer. It is true that, as between Godfrey and Reed and the bank, the latter was a debtor for value, and the transfer was valid. But the protection is not given by the rules of law to a party in such a predicament merely. He must not only have had no notice, but he must have paid a consideration at the time of the transfer, either in money or other property, or by a surrender of existing debts or securities held for the debts and liabilities. But here the bank has merely possessed itself of the property transferred as auxiliary security for the old debts and liabilities. It has paid or given no new consideration upon the faith of it. It is therefore, in truth, no purchaser for value in the sense of the rule.'
17
18
After referring to Dickerson v. Tillinghast, in which it was held by Chancellor WALWORTH that the transfer of an estate upon which there was a prior unrecorded mortgage, in payment of ap re-existing debt, without the transferee giving up any security or divesting himself of any right, or placing himself in a worse situation than he was in before, did not make the latter, who was without notice of the prior mortgage, a grantee or purchaser for a valuable consideration, Mr. Justice STORY proceeded: 'I do not say that I am prepared to go quite to that length, seeing that, by securing the estate as payment, the pre-existing debt is surrendered and extinguished thereby. But here there was no such surrender or extinguishment or payment; and the general principle adopted by the learned chancellor is certainly correct, that there must be some new consideration moving between the parties, and not merely a new security given for the old debts or liabilities, without any surrender or extinguishment of the old debts and liabilities, or the old securities therefor. So that upon this ground alone the title of the bank would fail. The case of Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, does not apply. In the first place, there the bill was taken in payment or discharge of a pre-existing debt. In the next place, it was a case arising upon negotiable paper, and who was to be deemed a bona fide holder thereof, to whom equities between other parties should not apply. Such a case is not necessarily governed by the same considerations as those applicable to purchasers of real or personal property under the rule adopted by courts of equity for their protection.' See, also, Rison v. Knapp. 
18
19
In Johnson v. Peck, which was a case of a mortgage given to secure a pre-existing debt due from a mortgagor who had previously purchased the goods under such representations as entitled his vendor to sue to recover them back, Mr. Justice WOODBURY said: 'When rights of third persons intervene in this class of cases they are to be upheld, if those persons purchased the property absolutely, and parted with a new and valuable consideration for it without notice of any fraud. * * * But if they have notice of the fraud, or give no new valuable consideration, or are mere mortgagees, pawnees, or assignees in trust for the debtor, or for him and others, such third persons are to be regarded as holding the goods open to the same equities and exceptions as to title as they were open to in the hands of the mortgagor, pawner, or assignor.' And so in 2 Amer. Lead. Cas. (5th Amer. Ed.) it is stated, and we think properly, as the doctrine established by a preponderance of authority, that, 'whatever the rule may be in the case of negotiable instruments, it is well settled that the conveyance of lands or chattels as security for an antecedent debt will not operate as a purchase for value or defeat existing equities.' See 2 Lead. Cas. Eq. ( Id. 83, (4th Amer. Ed.) pt. 1.
19
20
Such, we think, is also the doctrine of the supreme court of Michigan. In Kohl v. Lynn, the court, after observing that the object of the statute is to protect those who have acquired rights under the circumstances which would render them liable to be defrauded unless protected against instruments of which they knew nothing when acquiring their rights, said: 'It has always been held that a purchaser who had paid nothing could not be thus defrauded, and that no one could be protected as a bona fide purchaser, except to the extent of his payments made before he received such notice as should have prevented him from making further payments. This doctrine has been too uniformly recognized to require discussion or citation of authorities. As Kohl had made no payments at all before the property was replevied from him, he was not a bona fide purchaser, and his rights are subject to the mortgage.'
20
21
In Stone v. Welling, where the issue was between the holder of an unrecorded mortgage and a subsequent grantee, who agreed to surrender indebtedness of the grantor to him and others, and put the deed on record without notice of the mortgage, the court said: 'Welling claims that the agreement which was given for the deed was amply sufficient to support it, and to entitle him to the rights of a bona fide purchaser under the recording laws. It was satisfactory, it is said, to Hart; and as to the indebtedness held by Welling and Root against him, it would have the effect of a present discharge. That it was satisfactory to Hart can be of no consequence on this question, since, to constitute Welling a bona fide purchaser, he must have parted with something of value, and not merely given a contract which he could avoid of his title under the deed proved defective. Thomas v. Stone, Walk. Ch. Dixon v. Hill, Warner v. Whittaker, Blanchard v. Tyler, Nor do we think the agreement had the effect to discharge any indebtedness. It was executory in its character, covering not only the claims of Welling and Root, but also other claims to be procured by them, and upon which it cannot be claimed that the agreement itself would have any effect whatever.'
21
22
In Boxheimer v. Gunn, the defendant in a suit brought to foreclose a recorded mortgage relied upon a subsequent deed of the mortgagor, which he was induced to take under the representation of the latter that the mortgage debt had been paid. After sustaining the claim of the plaintiff upon certain grounds, the court said that the defendant must fail in the suit upon the further ground that, although he acted with good faith, he was not a bona fide purchaser or incumbrancer for value, with equities superior to those of the plaintiff, because it appeared that the conveyance to him was 'merely as a security for a precedent debt,' without his paying or agreeing to pay any other consideration, or relinquishing any remedy or right he may have had.
22
23
Without further discussion of the authorities cited by counsel, all of which have been carefully examined, we are of opinion that the claim of the bank to be a subsequent mortgagee in good faith cannot be sustained, because the mortgage of February 11, 1881, although first filed, was not given in consideration of its having surrendered, or agreed to surrender, or to postpone the exercise, of any substantial right it had against the mortgagors, but merely as collateral security for past indebtedness. Under such circumstances, the mortgage which was prior in time confers a superior right.
23
24
Other questions of a minor character are discussed by counsel, but it is not deemed necessary to consider them. We perceive no error in the record, and the judgment is affirmed.

CHICAGO, B. & K. C. R. Co.
v.
STATE OF MISSOURI ex rel. GUFFEY, Collector, etc.
March 7, 1887.
1
The judgment which this writ of error brings up for review affirms the liability to taxation, in Missouri, for state and county purposes, of what was formerly known as the Central North Missouri Branch of the St. Joseph & Iowa Railroad, more recently named the Linneus Branch of the Burlington & Southwestern Railway Company, and now owned by the Chicago, Burlington & Kansas City Railroad Company, a corporation organized under the laws of Missouri. The latter company claims to have succeeded to all the rights, priviliges, and immunities granted to the St. Joseph & Iowa Railroad Company in its charter of among which was an exemption of its stock from taxation for 'state and county' purposes. As the construction which the supreme court of Missouri places upon certain legislation, enacted after the charter of the St. Joseph & Iowa Railroad Company was granted, is inconsistent with the exemption claimed, the controlling question on this writ of error is whether the local statutes, as interpreted and applied by that court, impair the obligation of any contract which the company had with the state, and thereby deprive its successor, the plaintiff in error, of any rights secured by the constitution of the United States.

That question mainly depends upon the construction of an act of the general assembly of Missouri entitled 'An act to aid in the building of branch railroads in the state of Missouri,' approved March 21, 1868. That act took effect from its passage, and is as follows:
2
3
'(1) Any railroad company in this state authorized by law to build branches, and wishing to avail themselves of the provisions of this act, shall, by its board of directors, pass, and cause to be entered upon its records, a resolution setting forth such desire, and designating the name under which such branch shall be built, its point of intersection with its main line, and general course, a certified copy of which resolution shall be filed with the secretary of state, after which they shall be governed by the provisions of this act.

'(2) Whenever any such railroad company shall undertake the construction of a branch designated as provided in the first section of this act, they shall receive donations or subscriptions to stock to aid its construction in the name of such branch, which shall be expressed in the certificate of stock issued. The cost and expenses of constructing and operating such branch shall be kept separate and distinct from expenses on the main line. They may borrow money and issue bonds secured by mortgage on such branch road to aid in its construction, and, in general, may operate, lease, sell, or consolidate with any connecting road, distinct and separate from their main line, and in any other way may manage or dispose of such branch as by law they may be authorized with reference to their main line, and separate therefrom.
4
5
'(3) Any branch road so constructed shall not be holden for any debt, lien, or liability of the main line, nor shall the main line be holden for any debt, lien, or liability of such branch. Any dividends of profits arising out of the business of such branch road shall be divided among the stockholders in said branch; and in all respects the interest of the stockholders in the branch shall be kept separate and distinct from the interests of the stockholders in the main line.
5
6
'(4) The holders of stock in an railroad company which was subscribed in aid of the construction of a branch road according to the provisions of this act shall have the same rights as other stockholders in the company in the choice of officers; but in all matters directly and specially affecting the interests of such branch road the stockholders in such branch shall control, and for such purpose the directors, under their by-laws, may, or on the petition of parties representing one-tenth of such stock shall, call a meeting of the stockholders in such branch, setting forth the object of such meeting; and at any such meeting such stockholders may instruct the board of directors in all matters relating especially to their interests, and they shall be governed by such instructions, if not inconsistent with the laws of the state and the powers of such company.' Laws Mo.

The branch road in question was constructed under the provisions of that statute. That fact distinctly appears from the preamble and resolutions adopted by the board of directors of the St. Joseph & Iowa Railroad Company, March 25, 1871, (a certified copy thereof being filed April 19, 1871, in the office of the secretary of state of Missouri,) and expressly stating the purpose of the company to avail itself of the provisions of the act of in building this branch road.

8
The statute, it will be observed, does not exempt from taxation stock subscribed in aid of the construction of the branch roads for which it makes provision. But as it applies to railroad companies 'authorized by law to build branches,' and as the St. Joseph & Iowa Railroad Company was authorized by its charter of to build such branch roads as it deemed proper, (State v. County Court Sullivan Co., ) it is contended that the exemption, by the company's original charter, of its stock from taxation for state and county purposes extends to stock subscribed in the name and exclusively for the benefit of the branch road constructed under the act of .
8
9
When that statute was passed, the constitution of Missouri of declared that 'no property, real or personal, shall be exempt from taxation, except such as may be used exclusively for public schools, and such as may belong to the United States, to this state, to counties, or to municipal corporations within this state.' Article 11, § 16.
9
10
As, perhaps, every railroad company organized under the laws of the state prior to the adoption of the constitution of had general authority to construct branch roads, it is clear that the construction of the act of for which the appellant contends cannot be accepted, except upon the theory that the legislature intended to evade the constitutional inhibition upon exemptions of property from taxation; for it is plain, from the provisions of the act of that the roads which it authorized to be built, although called branch roads, are, for all purposes of separate ownership and management, independent lines, quite as distinct from the main lines as if constructed and operated by other and different corporations. Such provisions as are to be found in that statute are rarely ever found in legislative enactments. An analysis of them shows that any 'branch' road constructed under it must be designated by the name under which it is built; donations and subscriptions in aid of it must be received in that name; the cost of construction and management must be kept separate and distinct from expenses incurred on the main line; money may be borrowed and bonds issued secured by mortgage on the branch only; the branch road may be sold, operated, leased, or consolidated with any connecting road of another corporation, or disposed of separately from the main line; it is liable only for its own debts, and not for those of the main line; profits arising out of the business of such branch road can be divided only among its stockholders, and their interests are to be kept distinct from those of the stockholders of the main lie ; and the board of directors of the company owning the main line are required, in all matters relating especially to the interests of the stockholders of the branch road, to follow all instructions given by the latter, without regard to their effect upon the main line. In other words, the stockholders of a branch road constructed under the act of constitute, in effect, a separate organization, having no connection whatever with the stockholders of the main line, except that the main line and the branch road are, for purposes of convenience, managed by the same board of directors.
10
11
It may be conceded, for all the purposes of this case, that if the St. Joseph & Iowa Railroad Company, or the company which succeeded to its rights, privileges, and immunities, had built a branch road under the charter of it could, in respect to that branch, have stood upon the exemption contained in its charter. Any stock issued by it, and sold to aid in the construction of such a branch road, would, in that case, have been on the same footing in all respects as other stock it may have issued; and its main and branch lines would have been parts of the same system, controlled by the board of directors as they deemed proper. But the company elected not to adopt that course, for the reason, perhaps, that it could not, in that mode, have raised the money necessary to build a branch road. In the condition in which all the railroads of Missouri were left by the civil war, it would have been difficult to raise money to build branch roads if their future was to be endangered by connection with main lines which needed repairs, and the corporations owning which were without credit. It was doubtless for that reason the St. Joseph & Iowa Railroad Company, instead of constructing a branch road under the charter of determined to avail itself of the provisions of the statute of which permitted it to construct and maintain what is called a branch road, but what, in fact, would be a road having only nominal connection with the main line of the company. The branch roads to which the charter of the St. Joseph & Iowa Railroad Company referred were, in our judgment, such as would be subject to the same control and management as its main line, and not roads that were branch roads only in name, but were distinct lines, operated solely with reference to the interests, and pursuant to the directions, of those holding stock therein, irrespective of the necessities of the main line.
11
12
To avoid the conclusion that there was a purpose to devise a plan whereby railroad property should be exempt from taxation, which the constitution of intended should be taxed, we must assume that the legislature intended to invite railroad corporations having general power under their charters to construct branch roads, to waive the exercise of such power, and construct roads under the provisions of the act of which, although not granting an immunity from taxation, yet afforded peculiar protection to those whose money might be used in such construction. To say the least, it is not clear that the legislature intended that the exemption from taxation given by such charters as that granted to the St. Joseph & Iowa Railroad Company should be extended to branch roads constructed under the act of As that statute does not grant immunity from taxation to roads constructed under its provisions, and as the system established by it is complete in itself, without reference to other legislative enactments, the present claim to exemption must be denied; for it is the settled doctrine of this court that an immunity from taxation by the state will not be recognized unless granted in terms too plain to be mistaken. Providence Bank v. Billings, Philadelphia & W. R. R. v. Maryland, Memphis R. R. v. Commissioners, Sup. Ct. Rep. Southwestern R. R. v. Wright, Sup. Ct. Rep, Vicksburg, etc.,R . Co. v. Dennis, Sup. Ct. Rep.

13
As our conclusion upon this point accords with that of the state court, and is sufficient to dispose of the whole case, we omit any consideration of other questions presented in argument. Judgment affirmed.

SCHLEY
v.
PULLMAN'S PALACE CAR CO.
March 7, 1887.
1
Before entering upon the consideration of the case it is proper to notice the motion made in behalf of the plaintiff in error, to strike out certain parts of the printed argument filed by the counsel for the defendant in error. Notwithstanding the agreement that the case should be heard in the court below upon the single question referred to in the stipulation, the counsel for the defendant in error states many things which he declares to be 'incontrovertible facts,' and within the knowledge of opposing counsel, but which are wholly unsustained by anything in the record. The motion to strike out relates to those matters. The excuse given for this breach of professional propriety is 'the extreme brevity of the record.' But it is the same record upon which counsel for the company succeeded for his client, and which, by agreement, contained all that was to be submitted to the court. The excuse given furnishes no apology whatever for his violation of the terms of the stipulation. Much less does it palliate his attempt to influence the decision here by reference to matters not in the record, and which he must have known could not be taken into consideration. It is only necessary to say that the facts dehors the record, which have been improperly introduced into the brief of the counsel for the defendant in error, have not in any degree influenced our determination of the case.

The plaintiff insists that the deed was void under the laws of Illinois, upon two grounds: (1) That the husband is not a party to the deed; (2) that the acknowledgment is defective. In Lane v. Soulard, it was held that the Revised Statutes of Illinois of repealed all former laws on the subject of conveyances of real estate, and authorized married women within that state to convey land by joining with their husbands, and acknowledging the deeds in a specified way; but that no provision was made for the conveyance by non-resident married women of their lands in Illinois until the passage of the act of February 22, 1847. See, also, Higgins v. Crosby, Robers v. Higgins, This case depends mainly upon the construction to be placed upon the second section of the latter act, which was in force when the deed of May 26, 1856, was executed. That section is as follows: 'When any feme covert, not residing in this state, being above the age of eighteen years, shall join with her husband in the execution of any deed, mortgage, conveyance, or other writing of or relating to any lands or real estate situate within this state, she should thereby be barred of and from all estate, right, title, interest, and claims of dower therein, in like manner as if she was sole and of full age. And any such feme covert joining with her husband in the execution of a power of attorney or other writing, authorizing the sale, conveyance, or other disposition of lands or real estate as aforesaid, shall be bound and concluded by the same, in respect to the right, title, claim, or interest in such estate, as if she were sole and of full age as aforesaid; and the acknowledgment or proof of such deed, mortgage, conveyance, power of attorney, or other r iting may be the same as if she were sole, and shall entitle such deed, mortgage, conveyance, power of attorney, or other writing to be recorded as is authorized by this act; and the provisions of this section shall apply to deeds, mortgages, conveyances, powers of attorney, and other writing heretofore as well as these which may hereafter be executed.' 2 Scates, T. & B. St. Ill. Gross, St. Ill. c. 24, § 24; 1 Adams & D.'s Real-estate St. & Dec. Ill.

Did Christina Lynn, within the meaning of that statute, 'join with her husband in the execution' of the deed of The plaintiff contends that she did not, because the name of the husband is not expressly designated in the body of the deed as a grantor. It is argued that as William Lynn, the husband, had during coverture a freehold interest jointly with his wife in her estate of inheritance, with absolute ownership of the rents and profits of the wife, the requirement in the act of that she should join him in the execution of any deed for real estate, was a recognition of his supremacy and right of control, and necessarily implied that he, as grantor, so named in the granting or operating clauses, must pass whatever interest he had, and thereby also express his willingness that the wife should convey her title or estate. While this position is sustained by some adjudications, it is necessary to inquire as to the state of the local law; for the rights of the parties must be governed by the requirements of that law in respect to the mode in which real property situated within the limits of that state may be conveyed or transferred. U. S. v. Crosby, Clark v. Graham, McCormick v. Sullivant, Suydam v. Williamson, Brine v. Insurance Co..

In Johnson v. Montgomery, the question was whether dower was barred by a deed executed in 1853, in Ohio, conveying lands in Illinois belonging to the husband, the wife signing the deed, and duly acknowledging it before a proper officer. But the wife was not named in the body of the deed, nor was her right of dower referred to therein in any way. It is true, as suggested by counsel for the plaintiff in error, that an inchoate right of dower is not a present estate in lands, and that the court in that case expressly waived any decision of the question whether the deed then before it would have been good under the act of and placed its decision entirely upon the twenty-first section of the statute of conveyances of That section provides that it shall be lawful 'for any married woman to release her right of dower of, in, and to any lands and tenements, whereof her husband may be possessed or seized by any legal or equitable title during coverture, by joining such husband in the deed or conveyance for the conveying of such lands and tenements, and appearing and acknowledging the same, etc., * * * which [certificate of privy examination] being recorded, together with the deed, duly executed and acknowledged by the husband according to law, shall be sufficient to discharge and bar the claim of such woman to dower in the lands and tenements conveyed by such deed or conveyance.' Adams & D. 133; Rev. St. Ill. The court, after observing that the deed merely extinguished the wife's contingent right of dower, and did not pass any estate she had in the land, said: 'This precise question has not hitherto been presented; but we entertain no doubt it has always been supposed by both the people and the profession in this state that a married woman, signing her husband's deed, and being properly examined before an officer, and causing his certificate of that fact to be placed upon the deed, would bar her dower in the premises conveyed, although her name nowhere appeared in the body of the deed. By signing the deed she 'joins' in it, and, having done this, her dower is barred if she takes the other steps pointd out by the statute.' This decision bears somewhat on the question as to what the local statutes mean when they require the wife to join with the husband in a conveyance of real estate.

In Miller v. Shaw, one of the questions was whether a certain conveyance by a married woman, living in Illinois with her husband, passed the title to her separate real property situated in that state; the husband not joining with her in the granting clause of the deed. The statute in force when the deed was made prescribed the mode in which the husband and wife, residing in Illinois, could convey the real estate of the wife. Act Adams & D. It made it lawful for the husband and wife to 'execute' any grant, lease, deed, or conveyance of such estate. The court said: 'That which this statute requires to be done to enable the wife to convey her separate property is that she and her husband shall execute the deed, and after that she shall appear before a proper officer, and acknowledge the same in the mode pointed out in the statute; and, such deed being acknowledged or proved according to law by the husband, it will be as effectual to pass the title to the wife's separate property as the deed of an unmarried woman would be to convey her property. All this was done in this case. Both Mrs. Sheldon and her husband executed the deed to Ward, and afterwards she appeared before a proper officer, and acknowledged it in conformity with the statute; and the acknowledgment of her husband to the deed being according to law, that seems to be all the law requires to be done to make the deed effectual to pass the title to the wife's separate estate.'

The latest case to which our attention has been called is Yocum v. Lovell, By a statute of Illinois every householder is declared to be entitled 'to an estate of homestead,' to a specified amount, in the farm or lot of land, and buildings thereon, owned or rightly possessed, by lease or otherwise, and acquired by him or her as a residence; such homestead, and all right and title therein, being exempted from attachment, judgment, levy, execution, or sale for the the payment of his debts or sale for the payment of his debts laws of conveyance, descent, and devise, as provided in that statute. The exemption continues after the death of the householder, for the benefit of the surviving husband or wife, so long as he or she occupies such homestead, and of the children until the youngest child become 21 years of age. The statute also provides that 'no release, waiver, or conveyance of the estate so exempted shall be valid, unless the same is in writing, subscribed by said householder and his or her wife or husband, if he or she have one, and acknowledged in the same manner as conveyances of real estate are required to be acknowledged, or possession is abandoned or given pursuant to the conveyance, or, if the exemption is continued to a child or children, without the order of the court directing a release thereof.' Rev. St. In the case last cited, the question was whether a trust deed expressly relinquishing the homestead right was effectual for that purpose, the name of the wife not appearing in the granting clause of the deed, though it was signed and duly acknowledged by herself and husband in conformity with the statute. The court held the deed to be sufficient to pass the interest of both husband and wife in the estate of homestead; observing that the statute did not require the name of the husband or wife to appear in the body of the deed. Referring to Miller v. Shaw as presenting an analogous question, the court said: 'In the case now being considered the wife joins with her husband in the release of the homestead in precisely the same manner as the husband did with the wife in the case cited.' While those cases do not cover the precise question under consideration, we are of opinion that, under the principles announced in them, the dee of May 26, 1856, must be upheld as a valid transfer, under the law of Illinois, of the interest of Christina Lynn and her husband. If, as adjudged by the supreme court of the state, the wife, whose name did not appear in the operative clause of the husband's conveyance of his lands, is to be held as having joined him therein, and surrendered her right of dower, by simply signing the deed, and acknowledging it in conformity with the statute, and upon privy examination duly certified; if, under a statute making it lawful for husband and wife 'to execute' a conveyance of her real estate, they will both be held to have executed a conveyance of her separate property where her name appears, but that of the husband does not appear, in the granting clause of the deed, but they both sign and acknowledge it in the mode required by law; and if the wife's 'estate of homestead' can be conveyed by a deed, signed and duly acknowledged by herself and husband, her name, however, not appearing in the body of the deed,—it would seem to follow that within the meaning of the act of and according to the tendency of the decisions of the supreme court of the state, the wife joins with her husband in the execution of a conveyance of her estate of inheritance where her name alone appears in the granting clause, but the deed is signed by both herself and husband, is acknowledged by both, and is certified as required by law. Such conveyance, so signed, acknowledged, and certified, of the wife's land, seems to be as effectual, under the local law, to invest the grantee with the title and interest of both husband and wife as if his name had also appeared in the granting clause.
6
7
If, as suggested, the purpose of the act of in requiring the wife to join the husband in the execution of conveyances of her real estate was to protect her against strangers, and secure his co-operation and counsel, that object was as fully accomplished by his signing and acknowledging the deed with her as it would have been by designating him in the body of the deed as co-grantor with the wife. It is proper to say that the question under consideration is not free from difficulty, and we should have been glad to be guided, in our determination of it, by an express decision of the highest court of the state. The conclusion reached by us is more in harmony with what that court has held in cases somewhat analogous than would be a decision adjudging the deed of to be void.
7
8
One other question remains to be considered. It is contended that the certificate of acknowledgement is fatally defective for two reasons: (1) It does not appear that Mrs. Lynn was personally known to the magistrate, or that she was proved by a credible witness to be the same person as the one who subscribed to the deed; (2) it does not appear that she was informed of the contents of the deed. In support of these objections, the counsel for the plaintiff in error relies upon the twentieth section of the chapter on 'Conveyances' in the Revised Statutes of That section provides: 'No judge or other officer shall take the acknowledgment of any person to any deed or instrument of writing as aforesaid, unless the person offering to make such acknowledgment shall be personally known to him to be the real person who and in whose name such acknowledgment is proposed to be made, or shall be proved to be such by a credible witness; and the judge or officer taking such acknowledgment shall, in his certificate thereof, state that such person was personally known to him to be the person whose name is subscribed to such deed or writing, or having executed the same, or that he was proved to be such by a credible witness, (naming him,)' etc. That chapter was amended by the act of February 11, 1853, the first section of which provides 'that no deed, mortgage, or other instrument of writing, heretofore executed or hereafter to be executed by husband and wife, in good faith, for the purpose of conveying or incumbering the estate of the husband, or the estate of the wife, or the right of dower in any lands situate in this state, and acknowledged by them before any officer authorized by the laws of this state to take acknowledgments, shall be deemed, held, or adjudged invalid, or defective or insufficient in law, by reason of any informality or omission in setting forth the particulars of the acknowledgment before such officer, as aforesaid, in the certificate thereof: provided, however, that it appears in substance, from such certificate, that the parties executing said deed, mortgage, or other instrument of writing executed the same freely and voluntarily; and that, in case of married women executing the same, it appear, in substance, that they knew the contents or said deeds, mortgages, or other instruments of writing, and that they were examined by the officer aforesaid, separate and apart from their husbands.' Adams & D. 185.
8
9
It was said in Lindley v. Smith, that the requirement that the certificate should show that the person acknowledging it was personally known to the officer to be the person whose name is subscribed to the deed, or was proved to be such by a credible witness, was one of substance, and salutary in its operation, and was not dispensed with by the act of and that 'it is the acknowledgment of the feme covert which is the operative act to pass her title.' See, also, Murphy v. Williamson, Assuming this to have been the settled law of Illinos when the deed in question was executed, and that the case, on this point, is governed by the Revised Statutes of the result claimed by the plaintiff in error does not follow. The cases cited do not sustain the objection to the certificate of acknowledgment. In Lindley v. Smith, one of the cases relied upon by the plaintiff in error, there was no language in the certificate of the wife's acknowledgment from which it could be inferred that she was either personally known to him, or was proved by a witness to be the person who had, as wife, signed the deed. To the same class belong the cases of Heinrich v. Simpson, 66 Ill. 57, and Coburn v. Herrington, The officer's certificate in this case states that 'personally came Christina Lynn and William Lynn, her husband, known to me to be the persons who executed the foregoing instrument, and acknowledged the same to be their free act and deed.' This is, in substance, a statement that they came before the officer, and were personally known to him to be the real persons who in fact subscribed and acknowledged the deed.
9
10
The objection that the officer's certificate does not state that she was informed formed of the contents of the deed—if it have any force whatever under the act of permitting the non-resident feme covert to acknowledge her deeds as if she were unmarried—is not well taken. The certificate shows that she executed the deed freely, and without force or compulsion from the husband or from any one else, 'fully understanding the contents' thereof. Besides, this defect, if it be one, is of the kind that was cured by the act of which only required it to appear, in substance, as it does here, that the deed was executed freely and voluntarily, and in the case of a married woman, that she knew its contents, and was examined separately and apart from her husband. She must have known, if, as certified, she fully understood, the contents of the deed.

GILMER
v.
STONE and others.
March 7, 1887.
1
Robert Gilmer, late of Irish Grove, Menard county, Illinois, died December 31, 1883, having made a last will by which he disposed of his entire estate, consisting of about $in personal property, and from three to four hundred acres of land in that state. The eleventh clause of the will is in these words: 'I also, after paying all debts and claims against my estate, bequeath and devise the remainder of my estate to be equally divided between the Board of Foreign and the Board of Home Missions.' The object of the present suit is to obtain a decree declaring that clause to be void, and directing the estate of the testator, after meeting the debts and the bequests contained in other clauses, to be paid to the complainant, the uncle and only heir at law of the decedent. The Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America and the Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, corporations created under the laws of New York, severally appeared, were made defendants, and filed answers, each claiming the right to share in the devise in the eleventh clause of the will. The executors admit the justice of these claims, but ask the direction of the court in the premises. To these answers a general replication was filed; and, the cause having been heard upon the pleadings and proofs, the bill was dismissed, with costs.
1
2
It is agreed in the case that the Baptist, Methodist, Episcopal, and other churches, like the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, have boards of home and foreign missions; consequently it is contended the eleventh clause of the will is void for uncertainty as to the donee and the purposes of the gift. In this view we do not concur. It is undoubtedly the rule, in respect to the testamentary disposition of property, real and personal, that uncertainty either as to the subject or object of a devise will be fatal to its validity. But that rule has no application here; for, it there were no other fact in the case than that there are numerous boards which may be generally described by the words the 'board of foreign missions,' and 'the board of home missions,' the devise in the eleventh clause would not fail. With respect to charities, gifts may be good which, with respect to individuals, would be void; 'and, where there are two charities of the same name, the legacy will be divided between them, if it cannot be ascertained which was the intended object.' 1 Jarm. Wills, Can it be ascertained by competent evidence which of these various boards were the objects of the testator's bounty?
2
3
In the fourth clause of the will the testator bequeathed his library to the Presbyterian Church of Irish Grove; in the ninth, $towards the erection of a Presbyterian church in Greenview, Illinois, provided the same was built within two years from the date of the will, otherwise the money should revert to his estate; and in the tenth he bequeathed $50 to be paid on the minister's salary of the Presbyterian Church of Irish Grove for the year And there was extrinsic evidence to the following effect: That the testator had been for many years a member and ruling elder of the Irish Grove Presbyterian Church, one of the local congregations of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America; that collections were annually taken up in that congregation for the various boards of that church, including its Boards of Foreign and Home Missions; that while it was announced from the pulpit that collections would be taken for the Board of Foreign Missions or the Board of Home Missions, without, in words, naming the Presbyterian Church, all such collections, with the knowledge and assent of the church session, of which the testator was an active and zealous membe, were, without esception, sent to the officers of the Presbyterian Boards of Foreign and Home Missions in New York city, and regular reports thereof made to the session; that the testator took especial interest in the work of those particular boards, and uniformly contributed thereto; and that he did not, so far as his pastor or associates in the church session knew, make contributions to the societies of any other church, except to the Bible Society, which was sustained by several religious organizations.
3
4
Of the competency of this evidence there can be no doubt. The purpose of it was to place the court, as far as possible, in the situation in which the testator stood, and thus bring the words employed by him into contact with the circumstances attending the execution of the will. Such proof does not contradict the terms of that instrument, nor tend to wrest the words of the testator from their natural operation. It serves only to identify the institutions described by him as 'the Board of Foreign and the Board of Home Missions;' and thus the court is enabled to avail itself of the light which the circumstances in which the testator was placed at the time he made the will would throw upon his intention. 'The law is not so unreasonable,' says Mr. Wigram, 'as to deny to the reader of an instrument the same light which the writer enjoyed.' Wig. Wills, ( The proof made a case of latent ambiguity. Such an ambiguity may arise 'either when it names a person as the object of a gift, or a thing as the subject of it, and there are two persons or things that answer such name or description; or, secondly, it may arise when the will contains a misdescription of the object or subject.' Patch v. White, Sup. Ct. Rep. In the same case it was observed that, 'as a latent ambiguity is only disclosed by extrinsic evidence, it may be removed by extrinsic evidence.' See, also, Allen's Ex'rs v. Allen, Hinckley v. Thatcher, N. E. Rep. Breckinridge v. Dugcan, 2 A. K. Marsh. 51; Morgan v. Burrows, Brewster v. McCall, Tilton v. Society, Jarm. Wills, Greenl. Ev. § .
4
5
Construing, then, the will with reference to the extrinsic evidence of the uniform relations of the testator to the subject of Foreign and Home Missions, and to certain societies engaged in that kind of work, it is not to be doubted that, in the eleventh clause, he had in mind the Boards of Foreign and Home Missions of the general religious society or organization of which he was a member and officer. The words of the will very well apply to such an object, and therefore, in so interpreting its provisions, no violence is done to the language employed by the testator.
5
6
It is also contended that the Boards of Foreign and Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America are foreign religious societies or foreign societies organized for religious purposes, and, as such, cannot, under the laws of Illinois, take exceeding 10 acres of land each, and that the devise in the eleventh clause, being of more than acres of land jointly, is void and must fail.
6
7
In the case of Christian Union v. Yount, decided in 1879, we considered the question whether a conveyance, made in 1870, by a citizen of Illinois, of real estate there situated, of the value of $ to the American and Foreign Christian Union, a New York corporation, was void under the laws of Illinois; the object of that corporation being, 'by missions, colportage, the press, and other appropriate agencies, to diffuse and promote the principles of religious liberty and a pure evangelical Christianity, both at home and abroad, wherever a corrupt Christianity exists.' The validity of the conveyance was sustained upon the ground that the law of Illinois, as it existed in 1870, did not preclude a benevolent or missionar corporation of another state, being thereunto authorized by its own charter, from taking title to real estate within her limits, by purchase, gift, devise, or in any other manner.

It is, however, insisted that the force of that decision is weakened, if not destroyed, by the failure of the court to refer to section 44 of chapter 25 of the Revised Statutes of making it lawful for 'the members of any society or congregation,' theretofore formed or thereafter to be formed, 'for purposes of religious worship,' to 'receive, by gift, devise, or purchase, a quantity of land not exceeding ten acres, and to erect or build thereon such houses and buildings as they may deem necessary for the purposes aforesaid, and to make such other use of the land, and make such other improvements thereon, as may be deemed necessary for the comfort and convenience of such society or congregation.' Rev. St. p. Counsel overlook the fact that the court, in Christian Union v. Yount, referred incidentally, and as indicating the general course of legislation in Illinois, to the like provision in the act of No comment was made upon that provision, for the reason that it had no application to the case; there being no claim, as there could not well have been, that the American and Foreign Christian Union was, within the meaning of the statute, a society or congregation 'for purposes of religious worship.'

In St. Peter's Roman Catholic Congregation v. Germain, the supreme court of the state held that the foregoing section of the act of was not repealed by the act of March 8, 1869, providing 'for the holding of Roman Catholic churches, cemeteries, and other property,' but was displaced by the forty-second section of the act of April 18, 1872, (chapter 32 of the Revision of ) which last section, however, the court said, was substantially the same as the forty-fourth section of the act of and to be regarded as, in effect, merely continuing the latter in force.

We have therefore to inquire whether the devise in question is void under the act of April 18, 1872. That act makes provision for the formation of corporations for any lawful purpose, except banking, insurance, real-estate brokerage, the business of loaning money, and the operation of railroads other than horse and dummy railroads. It also makes provision for the incorporation of societies, corporations, and associations for any lawful purpose, not for pecuniary profit, 'capable of taking, purchasing, holding, and disposing of real and personal estate for purposes of their organization.'

'Sec. 35. The foregoing provisions shall not apply to any religious corporation; but any church, congregation, or society formed for the purpose of religious worship may become incorporated in the manner following, to-wit: * * *'

12
'Sec. 41. Upon the incorporation of any congregation, church, or society, all real and personal property held by any person or trustees for the use of the members thereof shall immediately vest in such corporation, and be subject to its control, and may be used, mortgaged, sold, and conveyed the same as if it had been conveyed to such corporation by deed; but no such conveyance or mortgage shall be made so as to affect or destroy the intent or effect of any grant, devise, or donation that may be made to such person or trustee for the use of such congregation, church, or society.
12
13
'Sec. 42. Any corporation that may be formed for religious purposes under this act, or under any law of this state, for the incorporation of religious societies, may receive, by gift, devise, or purchase, land not exceeding in quantity (including that already held by such corporation) ten acres, and may erect or build thereon such houses, buildings, or other improvements as it may deem necessary for the convenience and comfort of such congregation, church, or society, and may lay out and maintain thereon a burying ground; but nos uch property shall be used except in the manner expressed in the gift, grant, or devise, or, if no use or trust is so expressed, except for the benefit of the congregation, church, or society for which it was intended.'
13
14
The forty-fifth section permits any congregation, church, or society incorporated under the act to receive, by grant, devise, or bequest, real estate, not exceeding 40 acres, for the purpose of holding camp-meetings. Rev. St. 
14
15
Assuming, for the purposes of this case only, that a church, congregation, or society formed under the laws of another state, for purposes of religious worship in that state, could not lawfully receive, by gift, devise, or purchase, land, in Illinois, in excess of the quantity which may be received in either of those modes by a similar corporation formed under the laws of Illinois, we are satisfied that the sections last quoted from the act of do not embrace corporations of the class to which these Boards of Foreign and Home Missions belong. The Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America was formed 'for the purpose of establishing and conducting Christian missions among the unevangelized or pagan nations, and the general diffusion of Christianity.' Its power to hold real or personal estate in New York is restricted to such quantity as will produce an annual income not exceeding $ The object of the Board of Home Missions of that church is 'to assist in sustaining the preaching of the gospel in feeble churches and congregations in connection with the Presbyterian Church in the United States, and generally to superintend the whole of home missions in the behalf of such church, as the general assembly shall from time to time direct; and also to receive, take charge of, and disburse all property and funds which, at any time, and from time to time, may be intrusted to said church or said board for home missionary purposes.' It cannot take and hold real or personal property, the annual income of which shall exceed $.
15
16
While these boards are important agencies in aid of the general religious work of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, neither of them is, in any proper sense, or in the meaning of the thirty-fifth section of the act of a church, congregation, or society formed for the purpose of religious worship. The counsel for the plaintiff in error seem to lay stress upon the more general words, 'formed for religious purposes,' in the forty-second section of the act; but manifestly the other parts of the same section and previous sections show that the only corporations intended to be restricted in the ownership of land to ten acres were those formed for the purpose of 'religious worship,' and not to organizations commonly called benevolent or missionary societies. The reasons of public policy which restrict societies formed for the purpose of religious worship in their ownership of real estate do not apply at all, or, if at all, only with diminished force, to corporations which have no ecclesiastical control of those engaged in religious worship, and cannot prescribe the forms of such worship, nor subject to ecclesiastical discipline those who fail to conform to the rules, usages, or orders of the religious society of which they are members.
16
17
This conclusion does not, in the slightest degree, conflict with the decision in St. Peter's Roman Catholic Congregation v. Germain. That was the case of a conveyance of about 80 acres of land directly to a congregation or society 'formed for the purpose of religious worship,' as distinguished from a benevolent or missionary organization. The court held that, under the legislation of Illinois, 'a religious corporation is authorized to receive or acquire lands to the extent of ten acres, and no more. Any amount in excess of that is expressly forbidden by statute, and it follows that all conveyances, deeds, or other contracts made in violation of this proi bition, are absolutely void.'
17
18
As the eleventh clause was intended to pass, and was valid for the purpose of passing, to the Boards of Foreign and Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America the estate thereby devised, the decree must be affirmed. It is so ordered.

BOLLES and another
v.
TOWN OF BRIMFIELD.
March 7, 1887.
1
In Anderson v. Santa Anna, Sup. Ct. Rep. we had occasion to consider the validity of so much of the act of the legislature of Illinois of February 28 1867, in reference to municipal subscriptions to the stock of the Danville, Urbana, Bloomington & Pekin Railroad Company, as declared that where elections had been held, and a majority of the legal voters of any township or incorporated town declared in favor of a subscription to the stock of that company, 'then and in that case no other election need be held, and the amount so voted for shall be subscribed' as in that act provided; further, 'that such elections are hereby declared to be legal and valid,' as though that act had been in force at the time thereof, and all its provisions had been complied with. An election was held in the township of Santa Anna, July 21, 1866, but there was no authority of law for its being held. It was, however, conducted in the customary mode, and the proposition for a subscription was sustained by a majority of the legal voters of the township. The subscription was made October 1, 1867, in pursuance of that vote, and of the curative act of February 28, 1867. The validity of bonds issued in payment of the subscription was disputed upon the ground that the last-named act was in violation of the constitution of Illinois. We held, in accordance with numerous decisions of this court cited in the opinion, that subsequent legislative ratification of the acts of a municipal corporation, which might lawfully have been performed under legislative sanction in the first instance, was equivalent to original authority. We referred, in that case, to United States Mortgage Co. v. Gross, where the supreme court of Illinois said that, 'unless there be a constitutional inhibition, a legislature has power, when it interferes with no vested right, to enact retrospective statutes to validate invalid contracts, or to ratify and confirm any act it might lawfully have authorized in the first instance.'
1
2
As a municipal corporation, organized for public purposes, has, as a general rule, and as between it and the state, no privileges or powers which are not subject at all times, under the constitution, to legislative control, and as the legislature might legally have authorized a subscription by the township of Santa Anna, with the assent of a majority of its legal voters, we adjudged the act of February 28, 1867, to be within the constitutional power of the legislature to pass.
2
3
Does the present case come within these principles? By the sixth section of an act of the general assembly of Illinois, approved March 5, 1867, incorporating the Dixon, Peoria & Hannibal Railroad Company, it is provided that 'the several counties in which any part of said road may hereafter be located, and the several townships in said counties which have adopted or may hereafter adopt township organizations, and the cities and incorporated towns in said counties, are hereby authorized to subscribe and take stock in said Dixon, Peoria & Hannibal Railroad Company.' 2 Priv. Laws Ill. The act restricted a subscription by a county to $ and a subscription by a township, city, or town to $.
3
4
It is admitted that at an election duly notified and held on the third day of August, 1868, the town of Brimfield, by a vote of as against 56, lawfully voted to subscribe $to the stock of the railroad company, and to issue its bonds therefor. At the same time and place, but without authority of law, an election was held to take the sense of the voters of the town as to an additional subscription by it of $to the stock of the same company, for which coupon bonds should be issued, payable in 10, 15, and 20 years. This last proposition was sustained by a vote of as against 55.
4
5
On the thirty-first of March, 1869, the general assembly of Illinois passed an act declaring 'that a certain election held in the township of Brimfield, in Peoria county, on the third day of August, 1868, at which a majority of the legal voters in said township, at special town meeting, voted to subscribe for and take $of the capital stock of the Dixon, Peoria & Hannibal Railroad Company over and above the amount authorized to be taken by the charter of said company, is hereby legalized and confirmed, and is declared to be binding upon said township in the same manner as if said subscription had been made under the provisions of said charter.' 3 Priv. Laws Ill. Subsequently, May 5, 1869, the township, by its proper officers, issued to the company its coupon bonds for $ in pursuance of the vote at the first-named election, and also its coupon bonds for $ pursuant to the above vote at the same time place, payable in 10, 15, and 20 years, as aforesaid. The present suit is upon bonds and coupons of the latter issue. A demurrer to a special plea setting forth these facts was overruled, and, the plaintiff electing to stand by the demurrer, the action was dismissed.
5
6
From this statement of the case, it is apparent that the judgment below is inconsistent with the decision in Anderson v. Santa Anna. It is not disputed that the bonds in suit would be valid obligations of the town of Brimfield if the election of August 3, 1868, at which they were voted, had been previously authorized by statute. In other words, according to the settled doctrines of the supreme court of Illinois, it would have been competent for the legal voters of the town, under legislative authority for that purpose previously given,—such voters being its 'corporate authorities' in the meaning of the state constitution as interpreted by the highest courts of Illinois,—to have required the subscription to be made, and the bonds to be issued, which were in fact made and issued pursuant to the unauthorized election of August 3, 1868. The question, then, is, could the legislature, by subsequent ratification, make that legal which was originally without legal sanction, but which it might, in the first instance, have authorized? A negative answer to this question would be in conflict with numerous decisions of this court upon the general question as to the power of a legislature to enact curative statutes when not restrained by constitutional provisions; the last of those decisions being Anderson v. Santa Anna. We adhere to what has been heretofore said by this court upon that subject; and, in doing so, we do not infringe upon the rule that, in respect to rights arising under, and depending upon the interpretation of, the constitution and laws of a state, this and other courts of the United States will accept as controlling the established doctrines of the highest court of the state as announced before such rights accrued. Burgess v. Seligman, Sup. Ct. Rep. 10; Carroll Co. v. Smith, Sup. Ct. Rep. Previous to the issuing of the bonds in suit, May 5, 1869, there had been no decision of the supreme court of Illinois to the effect that it was beyond the power of the legislature to enact such a statute as that of March 31, 1869, or that the legislature could not ratify and confirm such acts of a municipal corporation as would have been lawful if done under previous legislative authority. On the contrary, its decisions prior to that time, as we endeavored to show in Anderson v. Santa Anna, tended to sustain the validity, in such cases, of retroactive legislation. The first direct decision of the state court, so far as we are aware, adverse to the validity of such legislation, was Marshall v. Silliman, determined in 1871, after the bonds in suit were issued. The cases of People v. Mayor of Chicago, 51 Ill. 17; People v. Salomon, Id. 37; People v. City of Chicago, Id. 58; Harward v. St. Clair, etc., Drainage Co., Id. —and other cases of that class cited by counsel,—do not touch the question before us; for they decide, in effect, nothing more than that the power to levy taxes for local purposes could be conferred only upon the corporate authorities of the municipal body to be affected thereby; the oj ect of the constitutional provision that 'the corporate authorities of counties, townships, school-districts, cities, towns, and villages may be vested with power to assess and collect taxes for corporate purposes' being to define as well the class of municipal officers upon whom the power of taxation for local purposes might be conferred as the purposes for which such power could be constitutionally exercised. Quincy v. Cooke, Sup. Ct. Rep. 
6
7
So that substantially the same question is presented here that arose in Anderson v. Santa Anna. Having a clear conviction that the legislature did not transcend its power in enacting the statute of March 31, 1869, and there being, to say the least, at the time the bonds in suit were issued, no adjudication to the contrary in the supreme court of Illinois, we cannot surrender our judgment upon that question, and overrule the settled doctrines of this court, in deference to decisions by the state court, made long after the rights of the plaintiff accrued. Burgess v. Seligman, Caroll Co. v. Smith, and Anderson v. Santa Anna. In holding that the legislature did not violate the constitution of the state in passing the act of March 31, 1869, we do not disregard those decisions of the state court which hold that the legislature cannot impose a debt, for local corporate purposes, upon a municipal body, against the will of its corporate authorities; for, as often held by the state court, the corporate authorities of a town like Brimfield are its legal voters, and they, at the election of August 3, 1868, gave their consent to the subscription and bonds in question. The same voters who approved the subscription of $ at the same time, and by means of the same election machinery, approved an additional subscription for $ There is no suggestion in the record that the votes cast for the latter subscription did not constitute a majority of all the legal voters of the town. We must presume, upon this record, that the legislature ascertained, as stated in the act in question, that such a majority had, at the election of August 3, 1868, voted for the additional subscription of $ and we do not see that the subsequent ratification by the legislature of what had been done by the voters can be regarded as imposing a debt upon them against their will. The legislature simply gave effect to the wishes of the people, as expressed in the customary mode for ascertaining the popular will. Grenada Co. Sup'rs. v. Brogden, Sup. Ct. Rep. Anderson v. Santa Anna, Sup. Ct. Rep.

RICE
v.
UNITED STATES.
March 7, 1887.
1
'This action is brought by the assignee of Robert Erwin, under the provisions of the following act of congress, (19 St. at Large, c. 51,) which became a law February 5, 1877, without the president's approval:
1
2
"An act for the relief of Robert Erwin.
2
3
"Be it enacted, etc., that the court of claims may take jurisdiction under the provisions of the act of March 12, 1863, entitled 'An act to provide for the collection of abandoned property and for the prevention of frauds in insurrectionary districts within the United States,' of the claims of Robert Erwin, of Savannah, Ga., for property alleged to have been taken from him, which claims were by accident or mistake of his agent or attorney, and without fault or neglect on his part, as is claimed, not filed within the time limited by said act.'
3
4
'The petition, which was filed February 17, 1886, alleges, as the cause of action, that 'the said Robert Erwin, then a citizen of the state of Georgia, on the twenty-first day of December, 1864, was the exclusive owner, in his own right, of bales of upland cotton, stored in the said city of Savannah, which, on or about that day, was seized and captured by persons duly authorized and acting in behalf of the United States, and the proceeds of the sale made thereof, amounting, as is believed, and it is here charged, to the net sum of $ were paid into the treasury of the United States, pursuant to the provisions of the act of congress approved March 12, 1863, (chapter ) commonly called the 'Captured and Abandoned Property Act.' And on or about the first day of July, 1865, he was also the owner, exclusively, and in his own right, of another lot of bales of sea-island cotton, then stored at and in the warehouse of Evans & Parnell, in the town of Thomasville, in said state of Georgia, which, on or about that day, was also so seized and captured by persons duly authorized and acting in behalf of the United States, was removed to and stored at the government cotton-press in the city of Savannah, where it remained in the custody of said agents of the United States until in the month of August following, when it was by them forwarded, upon the schooner Enchantress, to Simeon Draper, the United States treasury agent in the city of New York, by whom it was subsequently sold for the account of the United States; and the proceeds thereof, amounting, as is believed and it is here charged, to the net sum of $ were duly accounted for by Simeon Draper, and were paid into the treasury of the United States in conformity with the said captured and abandoned property act. On the thirty-first day of December, 1868, the firm of Erwin & Hardee, of which said Robert Erwin was a member, filed their petition in bankruptcy under the provisions of the acts of congress relating thereto, in pursuance of which, on the fifteenth of January, 1869, they were duly adjudged bankrupts. And in the proceedings had in such bankruptcy one Robert H. Footman was appointed and qualified as assignee of said Erwin & Hardee, and proceeded in the administration of the trust until February 23, 1877, when, uypon his resignation thereof, your petitioner, the claimant, was appointed to succeed him, and was duly qualified as assignee of said bankrupts, and the claimant now avers that under and in virtue of the assignment in bankruptcy of the when, upon his resignation thereof, your & Hardee, and each of them, an of the proceedings had in the court in that regard, the claims of said Erwin, hereinbefore mentioned, against the United States, and for which this suit is prosecuted, became and now are vested in the claimant, who is now duly qualified and acting as assignee of said bankrupt, as is hereinbefore alleged.'
4
5
'The defendants file a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, and also a general demurrer, under each of which three objections are raised against the claimant's petition: '1. It is argued that the act under which the suit is brought was, in the words of the title, 'for the relief of Robert Erwin,' and not for his creditors through the assignee in bankruptcy previously appointed, and that the latter acquired no rights thereby, both because the act was not intended for him (Strong v. Hopkins, ) and because the right to sue was a valuable right or privilege acquired after the appointment of the assignee, and did not pass by the assignment.
5
6
'2. It is also argued that an assignee in bankruptcy has no right to keep the estate open, and bring actions nine years after his appointment. Rev. St. § Bailey v. Glover, Walker v. Towner. 
6
7
'We express no final opinion on these two points, although we are inclined to think that one of them, at least, is well taken. They merit serious consideration, and could not be passed by did we not prefer to rest our decision upon the third objection, which concerns more particularly the jurisdiction of this court. But they will be open to the defendants in the supreme court on appeal, if the case should go there.
7
8
'3. The third objection is that the claim, under the act of accrued more than six years before the filing of the petition, and so is forever barred by the following section of the Revised Statutes, which was held by the supreme court, in Haycraft's Case, Ct. Cl. 108, to be jurisdictional:
8
 Every claim against the United States cognizable by the court of claims shall be forever barred unless the petition setting forth a statement thereof is filed in the court, or transmitted to it by the secretary of the senate or the clerk of the house of representatives, as provided by law, within six years after the first claim accrues: Provided, that the claims of married women first accrued during marriage, of persons under the age of twenty-one years first accrued during minority, and of idiots, lunatics, insane persons, and persons beyond the seas at the time the claim accrued, entitled to the claim, shall not be barred if the petition be filed in the court, or transmitted as aforesaid, within three years after the disability has ceased; but no other disability than those enumerated shall prevent any claim from being barred, nor shall any of the said disabilities operate cumulatively.'
9
10
'A claim first accrues, within the meaning of the statute, when a suit may first be brought upon it, and from that day the six-years limitation begins to run. Any suit under the act of February 5, 1877, might have been instituted by filing a petition within six years after that date. That time has long since passed, and the present claimant has lost his rights thereunder, if he ever had any, unless his case is taken out of the operation of section Rev. St., in either of two ways which his counsel present. In his behalf it is insisted that the section applies only to claims which came under the general jurisdiction of the court before its enactment, and not to claims founded upon special acts subsequently passed. We do not concur in this view.
10
11
'A similar doctrine in relation to the right of appeal under section Rev. St., was considered by the supreme court in Zellner's Case, Ct. Cl. The court say: 'It is supposed, as the act concerning captured and abandoned property conferred upon the court of claims a new subject of jurisdiction in addition to those previously provided for, and at the same time made no provision for the appa ls to the supreme court from their judgments or decrees, no right of appeal existed in respect to either party, and that the general provision in the fifth section of the act of March 3, 1863, reorganizing the court, and conferring what may be called its general jurisdiction, cannot be invoked in this case. We cannot agree to this view. The language of the section is general: 'Either party may appeal to the supreme court of the United States from any final judgment or decree which may hereafter be rendered in any case by said court.' This court was organized as a special judicial tribunal to hear and render judgment in cases between the citizen and the government. The subjects of its jurisdiction were defined in the act, and generally the mode of conducting its proceedings, subject, of course, to such alterations and changes as congress from time to time might see fit to make. The subjects of its jurisdiction could be enlarged or diminished, but this would not disturb in any way or affect the general plan or system of its organization. If new or additional subjects of jurisdiction were conferred, the effect would be simply to increase the labors of the court, the case to be heard and determined under the existing organization.'
11
12
'In McKee's Case, the supreme court held expressly that 'section Rev. St., gives to the United States the right of appeal from the adverse judgments of the court of claims in all cases where that court is required by any general or special law to take jurisdiction of a claim made against the United States, and act judicially in its determination.' And the supreme court took jurisdiction of an appeal from this court upon a judgment rendered against Robert Erwin under this very act of although the only authority for it was found in section Rev. St.
12
13
'There is no distinction in principle between the application of the right of appeal, under section to special acts of legislation subsequently passed, and the application of the limitation of section to such cases. The act of created a new and additional subject of jurisdiction, and a new cause of action, by reviving an expired one, and, in our opinion, the general statute of limitation, as well as the general right of appeal, attaches and applies to it; just as when part payment on a promissory note takes a right of action thereon out of the statute, such right is not forever after relieved from all limitation, but the statute begins to run anew from the date of such payment. It is now more than nine years since this court was opened anew to the rightful claimant, whoever he may be, under the act of and, according to the construction urged by the present claimant, it is never to be closed until he be found, and of his own motion comes in and files his petition,—a construction which, in our opinion, is unreasonable, and not to be adopted. While congress has declared a general limitation of six years for 'every claim cognizable by the court of claims,' and a still shorter one of two years for claims under the captured or abandoned property act, it is unreasonable to infer that it intended to confer upon every claimant under the act of and the present one is the second who has appeared (Erwin's Case, 13 Ct. Cl. 49, affirmed on appeal, —the unusual and extraordinary privilege accorded to no other citizen, of bringing suit against the government at any future time without limitation. Such a construction would be in conflict with all idea of repose, which is said to be the object of statutes of limitation, and to the general policy of congress in all other cases.
13
14
'It was said in Clark's Case, decided a year before the passage of the act of now under consideration: 'It is not to be doubted that subsequent subjects of jurisdiction would be subject to the provisions of the statute of limitation if they were in the nature of money demands against the government.' This was then, and has ever since been, the settled doctrine of this court, and we have no doubt congress so understood it when the act of was passed.
14
15
'That the present claim, under that act, is a money demand against the government, and nothing else, we shall demonstrate beyond question, we are quite confident.
15
16
'But the claimant argues that the property received and sold, and the proceeds thereof in the treasury, under the peculiar legislation of the captured or abandoned act of March 12, 1863, (12 St. at Large, ) are trust funds, of which the defendants are merely trustees, and are subject to the rules and practice of courts of equity in relation to equitable trusts, one of which is that statutes of limitation do not run as between trustee and cestui que trust.
16
17
Some dicta, in early opinions of the supreme court arising under that act, have no doubt led to an erroneous impression that this court is to administer cases under it as though they were causes in equity, subject to the law of equitable trusts as applied in courts having chancery jurisdiction. In Klein's Case, and CHASE, C. J., in his opinion, said: 'The government constituted itself the trustee for those who were by that act declared entitled to the proceeds of captured and abandoned property, and for those whom it should thereafter recognize as entitled. * * * The property of the original owner is in no case absolutely divested. There is, as we have already observed, no confiscation, but the proceeds of the property have passed into the possession of the government, and restoration of the property is pledged to none except to those who have continually adhered to the government. Whether restoration will be made to others, or confiscation wil be enforced, is left to be determined by considerations of public policy. * * * It was for the government itself to determine whether such proceeds should be restored to the owner or not.'
17
18
'The doctrine now insisted upon as to trust and trusteeship is founded on that dictum. The case itself did not involve any consideration of the principles of equity as applied to trusts and trustees, and it does not appear exactly what, if any, such principles the learned chief justice understood might be invoked in the execution of the statute. But he does say that it was for the government itself to determine whether these proceeds should be restored to the owner or not. While Mr. Chase was secretary of the treasury, and for some time afterwards, the money received from captured and abandoned property was merely deposited with the treasurer, and was not technically, in departmental language, 'covered into the treasury,' and so, according to the construction then given by the department, was not subject to the constitutional provision that 'no money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law.' Const. art. 1, § 9, par. 6. More than two and a half million dollars of it was paid out by Secretaries Chase, Fessenden, and McCulloch, (Hodges' Case, ) without any appropriation therefor, when congress interposed and passed the joint resolution of March St. at Large, 251.) That resolution required all moneys received from sales of captured and abandoned property to be paid into the treasury of the United States, and they were thereupon 'covered into the treasury,' and mingled with other public money. No account has since been kept of the same as a separate fund, and as such they are not known except outside of the treasury department. Receipts and expenditures are entered as in other cases, and the statements which, from time to time, have been made, by request, relating thereto, have been taken from the scattered items of receipts and expenditures. Hodges' Case, The permanent appropriation for the payment of judgments of this court in captured and abandoned property cases is not chargeable to any fund, but is payable 'out of moneys in the treasury not otherwise appropriated.' Rev. St. § It is not at all improbable tha this legislation, enacted after Secretary Chase had left the department, escaped the observation of the chief justice when he wrote the dicta quoted from his opinion in Klein's Case.
18
19
'A trust in which the so-called trustee may legally mingle the trust money with his own, employ it for his own use, and himself determine whether he will forever retain it, or will give it to others, is a singular trust, unknown to law or equity, and to which no principles of equity jurisprudence can be found to apply. It is a universal rule of equity that if a trustee mingles trust money with his own, and uses it for his own benefit, he shall account for or pay interest thereon to the cestui que trust. Story, Eq. §§ ; Perry, Trusts, § But it is provided in Revised Statutes as follows:
19
 No interest shall be allowed on any claim up to the time of the rendition of judgment thereon by the court of claims unless upon a contract expressly stipulating for the payment of interest.' This court has always applied that section to cases under subsequently enacted special acts, and to those under the captured or abandoned property act. The claimant here might as well invoke the rule of equity as to interest, and demand payment of interest on the money received for the cotton in question, notwithstanding section Rev. St., as to invoke the equitable rule that statutes of limitation do not run in favor of trustees against the beneficiaries of the estate held by them.

'But more recent decisions, and the practice of this court and of the supreme court, have swept away all such ideas of trust in connection with the property or money received under the captured or abandoned property act. In Haycraft's Case, Ct. Cl. 110-112, the supreme court said, respecting captured and abandoned property, speaking by Chief Justice WAITE: 'The act of congress looked to its preservation, but authorized its capture. In so doing congress acted within its constitutional powers to 'make regulations concerning captures on land and water.' Article 1, § 8, par. 11. In the indiscriminate seizure which was likely to follow such an authority, it was anticipated that friends as well as foes might suffer. Therefore, to save friends, it was provided that any person claiming to have been the owner, at any time within two years after the suppression of the rebellion, might prefer his claim, and, upon proof of his ownership and loyalty, receive the money realized by the United States from the sale of the property. That expresses all there is of the trust or the remedy provided.' This certainly does not recognize much of a trust. It is no more so than is that upon which every person holds the property which is exclusively his own,—to be managed as he sees fit, and to be disposed of as he pleases. In such a trust, if that be not a misnomer, the special principles of equity do not apply, and courts of equity do not interfere.

'In Burke's Case, this court, speaking by Judge BANCROFT DAVIS, said: 'It is argued that this court sits as a court of equity in proceedings under the captured and abandoned property act, and that we must resort to equity to determine the status of this claimant. * * * An early attempt of this court to render judgment under the general act for specific performance (Alire's Case, was met by the supreme court by the remark that 'it is quite clear that the limited power to render a judgment confines the subject-matter to cases in which the petitioner sets up a moneyed demand as due from the government.' Alire's Case, Shortly afterwards the same court held that this court 'was authorized to enforce legal rights and obligations, but it could not proceed further, and judge of the equities between a citizen and his government.' * * * The government has not thought fit to allow itself to be sued in the court of claims on equitable considerations. Bonner's Case, About the same time, a question being raised concerning proceedings in cotton cases, the same court said: 'No special proceedings are prescribed to the court of claims' by the captured and abandoned property act, but 'they are to proceed in the usual way to hear and adjudicate upon the question of ownership and right to the proceeds according to the proofs and the law of the case.' Zellner's Case, Nearly simultaneously with these proceedings, however, the supreme court, in casual expressions in two cases, referred to the United States as a trustee holding the proceeds of captured and abandoned property for the owner's benefit, (Anderson's Case, 9 Wall. 56; Padelford's Case, Id. ) which expressions were repeated in two subsequent cases, (Klein's Case, Intermingled Cotton Cases, ) From these casual expressions it is argued that we are possessed of the equity jurisdiction necessary to administer upon trusts, and that the supreme court was mistaken when it said that 'the government has not thought fit to allow itself to be sued in the court of claims on equitable consideration.' That court, in calling the United States a trustee, may have referred to the large class of trusts cognizable at law. In its broad legal sense, the word 'trust' embraces many transactions and relations of business and property which are administered in courts of common law in states where two systems of jurisprudence and of remedies exist side by side. The familiar cases of bailments and of money had and received to the use of another are instances of such trusts.

The court may well have compared the relations of the government towards the fund in the treasury to this class of trusts. It is less probable that it intended to convert those relations into an equitable trust, since the essential elements of personal confidence and trust reposed in the depositary by the creator of the trust are wholly wanting. The language of Chief Justice WAITE in Haycraft's Case, where he 'expresses all there is of trust,' (22 Wall. 94,) warrants this conclusion. In administering upon the cotton cases this court has neither assumed to act as a court of equity, nor as a court of common law, but simply as the court of claims. Dicta of individual judges may afford ground for arguing in favor of equity jurisdiction in case of necessity, but no necessity for its exercise has yet arisen.'

'Moreover, if actions upon claims for the proceeds of property received under the provisions of the captured or abandoned property act were to be tried in equity, this court would have been relieved from making findings of fact in such cases, and the whole record, evidence and all, would be sent up to the supreme court on appeal. Hot Springs Cases, and Eastern Band of Cherokees' Case, and Sup. Ct. Rep. McClure's Case, Sup. Ct. Rep. But this court and the supreme court have never so regarded them, and a finding of facts has been required and has been made in every case under the abandoned or captured property act, as in other actions at law, and not in equity. See De Groot's Case, Ct. Cl. 2; Mahan's Case, and Pugh's Case, Nor has there been a single case where, in this court or in the supreme court, the special and peculiar principles of equity jurisprudence have been applied. The reason why the general statute of limitation did not apply to the captured and abandoned property act as originally enacted was that the latter had a shorter limitation of its own which took it out of, or was a limitation upon, the general statute. Fendall's Case, But the act of under which this suit is brought, has no special limitation of its own, and the reason wanting, the exception fails. Cessante ratione legis, cessat ipsa lex.

'In Taylor's Case, the supreme court called the United States trustees of the sup lus money paid into the treasury from the sales of lands for taxes under the direct tax acts (12 St. at Large, St. at Large, over and above that which was required to pay the tax, interest, and costs. That court did not treat the case as one in equity, and upon findings of fact by this court, as in cases at law, they held, as to the statute of limitations, that 'the right of the owner of the land to recover the money which the government held for him as his trustee did not become a claim on which suit could be brought, and such as was cognizable by the court of claims, until demand therefor ahd been made at the treasury. Upon such demand the claim first accrued,' and the statute of limitations began to run. So, in the present case, a suit cognizable by the court of claims could not have been brought after the limitation of the captured or abandoned property act had expired until the passage of the act of specially authorizing it, and from that time the statute of limitations began to run, and had run out long before the claimant came into court.

'The petition is dismissed.'

NOTT, J., delivered the following dissenting opinion:

'The plain and simple question in this case is whether the statute of limitations (Rev. St. § applies to the subject of jurisdiction known as the 'Captured Property Cases.' In Haycraft's Case, 22 Wall. 81, the counsel for the claimant asked the same question, and the supreme court answered that it did not. The argument which was addressed to the supreme court in that case will be found set forth (not in extenso) in It is an argument of extraordinary ingenuity, ability, learning, and earnestness. There have been several attempts since then to change the trust into implied contract, and to change the limited responsibility of the government as a trustee into the more extended responsibility of a stakeholder or bailee, but every idea and argument and illustration which have been advanced will be found more fully and forcibly set forth in the claimant's argument in Haycraft's Case. The object of that argument was to establish the position that the holding of the government was an implied trust, and the character of the government that of a stakeholder or bailee, as to which the law implies a contract to pay over the money to the rightful owner; and hence that the six-years statute of limitations was applicable to such cases. The supreme court answered that no implied contract existed; that the character of the government was that of a trustee; and that such cases did not come within the statute of limitations. The statute of limitations was made for the protection of the government, and is applicable to all cases where the government has incurred a personal liability. The jurisdictional period of two years prescribed by the abandoned or captured property act (12 St. at Large, was made for the protection of claimants, and to enable them all to come before the court at the same time, to the end that each might defend his own share of the fund from the adverse demands of adverse claimants. The two systems have been administered as distinct systems, without one single exception, until the present day; and how completely distinct they have been kept will be best understood from the following illustrations:
28
29
'The act March 3, 1863, (12 St. at Large, ) which reconstituted this court, and created the statute of limitations, (section 10,) likewise created the right of appeal, (section 5,) and a liability for interest, (section 7.) It is expressly provided 'that every claim against the United States cognizable by the court of claims shall be forever barred unless the petition be filed' within six years; but it is also expressly provided 'that, in all cases of final judgments by said court' in favor of the claimant, 'interest thereon at the rate of 5 per cent, shall be allowed.' Many judgments in favor of claimants were recovered in the captured property cases, and many, and for large amounts, wee suspended by appeals to the supreme court; yet in no case was interest upon such a judgment ever allowed or paid. If there was a personal liability on the part of the government in those cases as to which it can invoke the protection of the statute of limitations, then there was a personal liability for interest pending an appeal on those judgments, which, certainly, in law, in equity, and in good conscience, it is still bound to pay, as is very clearly shown by our brother, Mr. Justice SCOFIELD, in Hobb's Case, The Case of Zellner, was the first captured cotton case which came before the supreme court, and there are expressions in the opinion which have frequently been miscited and misunderstood. The decision was rendered in proceedings to obtain a mandamus, and relates to the single question of there being a right to appeal in that class of cases. The langugae of the opinion is to be construed in connection with that fact. Several years afterwards the Elgee Cotton Case, came before the court,—a case elaborately argued on behalf of the three adverse claimants,—and there it was said of suits under the abandoned or captured property act: 'That statute [act March 12, 1863] furnishes a complete system for the prosecution of claims under it, and defines the extent of the rights which those who claim an interest in the proceeds of property captured or abandoned during the civil war may assert against thegovernment.' The two decisions are not inconsistent. The former relates to a matter of practice and procedure, as to which it holds the general provisions of law governing practice and procedure applicable; the latter to rights and equities, as to which it holds the abandoned or captured property act to constitute a complete system.

'What, then, is the condition of the claimant's case? On the twentieth August 1868, Robert Erwin was the equitable owner of a fund in the treasury, of which the equitable title had never been divested from himself, being then held by the government as his trustee. On that day he might have instituted a suit for the fund, but on that day the jurisdictional period for instituting such suits expired. A provision of law confining jurisdiction to a certain period no more affects the party or the cause of action than a provision of law confining jurisdiction to a certain territory. Therefore Erwin's right to the fund did not expire with the right of the court to entertain his case. The effect of the statute was simply that on that day, as to such cases, the door of the court was shut. On the fifth February, 1877, congress reopened the door by passing the private act, (19 St. at Large, c. 51.) The original abandoned or captured property act said that the door should stand open for two years; the private act set no limitation of that kind, but leaves it open still, and still continues to declare that 'the court of claims may take jurisdiction' of the claim. The private act does not re-create the claim; it does not validate it; it does not remove the presumption of payment from it; it simply opens the doors of the court, and allows whoever may be entitled to do so to bring the claim in. Why, then, should not the claim be heard? The grant of jurisdiction has not expired; the private act has not been repealed; it still continues to say: 'The court of claims may take jurisdiction under the provisions of the act of March 12, 1863,' 'of the claims of Robert Erwin.' Why, then, should not the court of claims take jurisdiction and adjudge the case? The counsel for the government answers that the general statute of limitations applies to this demand, and bars the suit.
30
31
'If the statute of limitations applies so as to preclude a trial upon the merits, it must apply not to the door of jurisdiction, but to the claim itself. Statutes of limitation are statutes of repose, which do not extend to courts nor affect jurisdiction, but which attach to a debt or demand a presumption of payment, and operate to extingus h the thing itself as completely as if payment had been made. Therefore, if the statute of limitations applies to this claim, neither Robert Erwin, nor his assignee, nor any other person, can ever assert a right to the fund derived from his cotton. All other claimants can; but this claim must be considered in law as actually paid and extinguished. It is conceded that the claim was not so extinguished when the private law was passed. It is conceded that none of the thousands of other claims which are still outstanding upon the captured property fund is presumptively or legally extinguished by the statute of limitations. Why, then, is this? How is it possible that congress by passing an act, without the solicitation of the legal owner of the claim, the present claimant, authorizing a court to take jurisdiction of a case, and nothing more, can have attached to the claim itself another statute not previously applicable to it, which should in time work out a legal presumption of payment and an absolute extinguishment of the claimant's rights? If it be asked whether this thing can go on forever, the answer seems a very plain one. Congress did not here pass a general act, nor an act affecting a class of claims, but a grant of special jurisdiction for the benefit of a single, isolated case. The acts of grace and favor did not confer a right, but provided a remedy. Congress can take away the remedy at any time without trenching upon the claimant's rights.
31
32
'The counsel for the claimant has supposed that, in the administration of the abandoned or captured property act, the fund in the treasury was treated by this court as a fund in equity, and the counsel is right in his supposition. Considering that it dealt with millions, and must involve some of the most perplexing questions that could possibly be brought before a court, that act was in one particular probably the most extraordinary statute that was ever enacted. All that relates to the jurisdiction and duties of the court, and to the rights and disabilities of the parties, is to be found in nine lines which are thrust into a section primarily relating to the bonds and books of account of agents of the treasury. The judges who had to bear the heat and burden of that day in determining principles, in devising remedies, in framing a system which should be commensurate with the necessities of the situation,—that is to say, the judges who administered the statute from the Case of Tibbetts, to the Case of Boyd, —had an absolutely novel subject of jurisprudence assigned to them, without one word of statutory guidance to direct them, and without a precedent to be gathered from all the courts in the world. Whatever may be thought of the wisdom of their conclusion, one thing is incontrovertible, and that is that they eventually believed the fund in the treasury to be a fund in equity, and that they exercised in regard to it whatever power of a court of equity might be necessary to protect the fund. The interlocutory proceedings (Ct. Cl. 645) and the final decree ( in the Elgee Cotton Case and the decree in the Case of Rothschild, () will illustrate to any lawyer with any knowledge of equity jurisdiction that the court was dealing with rights and remedies which belong to the discretionary powers of a court of equity, and which are not the rights and remedies that come within the inflexible jurisdiction of a court of law. Some attempts have been made to show that courts of law have dealt with implied trusts in some such way, but the only authorities that could be found were Bacon's Abridgement and Reeve's History of the Common Law, and they, unhappily, related to a time when the court of chancery did not exist as a court of equity, and when the system of equity jurisprudence was not yet devised. But I do not regard the statute of limitation as necessarily exclusive of equity cases. I place my conclusion here entirely upon the ground that the private act grane d a remedy; that the remedy was not limited as to time; and that there is no law which attaches to this claim a presumption of payment.'

WAITE, C. J., announced that the judgment of the court of claims was affirmed by a divided court.
