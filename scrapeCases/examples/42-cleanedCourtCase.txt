v.
INDIAN TERRITORY ILLUMINATING OIL CO.*
Argued Jan. 6, 1937.
1
The respondent, Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Company, holds an oil and gas lease covering lands of restricted Pawnee Indians. The question relates to the constitutional authority of the state of Oklahoma to tax certain property used by the respondent in its operations as lessee. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma held that the property was not taxable because the lessee was a federal instrumentality and Congress had not consented to its taxation. ) We granted certiorari ( —-) October 12, 1936.

The property is described as 'one dwelling, portable, one garage, one tool house, engines, pump, water well equipment, tanks, derricks, casing, tubing, rods, pipe-lines, and one trailer truck, of the aggregate value of $' The tax is an ad valorem tax for the year There is no allegation or finding that the tax was discriminatory, the sole contention being that the property was not subject to ad valorem taxation because of its use as an adjunct to the production of oil and gas from the leasehold.

Our decisions distinguish between a nondiscriminatory tax upon the property of an agent of government and one which imposes a direct burden upon the exertion of governmental powers. In the former case where there is only a remote, if any, influence upon the exercise of governmental functions, we have held that a nondis criminatory ad valorem tax is valid, although the property is used in the operations of the governmental agency. This distinction, recognized by Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, 579, was stated and applied after full consideration in Thomson v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., and Union P. Railroad Company v. Peniston, 787. Recent illustrations are found in Alward v. Johnson, where the tax which was sustained was laid upon property used in operating an automotive stage line between points in California under a mail carrier's contract; and in Tirrell v. Johnston, where a tax known as the 'gasoline road toll' was held to be payable by a rural mail carrier who delivered the mail by means of his own motor vehicle. See, also, Thomas v. Gay, Baltimore Shipbuilding Co. v. Baltimore, Choctaw, O. & G.R. Co. v. Mackey, Willcuts v. Bunn, Susquehanna Power Co. v. State Tax Commission (No. Eastern Air Transport v. Tax Commission.

In Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Board of Equalization, an ad valorem tax upon crude oil, held by the company in its storage tanks, was sustained against the claim that the oil was exempt because in its production the taxpayer was operating as an instrumentality of the United States. There the taxpayer relied, as does the state court here, upon the ruling in Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir, where an ad valorem tax upon ores mined under a lease of restricted Indian land and in the bins on that land was held to be invalid. But we pointed out that in the Jaybird Case the tax 'was assessed on the ores in mass, and the royalties or equitable interests of the Indians had not been paid or segregated.' Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Board of Equalization, supra, at page In those circumstances the tax was regarded as an attempt to tax an agency of the federal government. Emphasizing that distinction, we said in referance to the Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Company: 'Such immunity as petitioner enjoyed as a governmental instrumentality inhered in its operations as such, and being for the protection of the Government in its function extended no further than was necessary for that purpose.' Id., at page

In that view the immunity cannot be said to extend to a nondiscriminatory ad valorem tax upon the property of the petitioner which is involved in the instant case. The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

THOMPSON et al.
v.
CONSOLIDATED GAS UTILITIES CORPORATION et al.
Argued Nov. 18, 19, 1936.
1
This case challenges the validity of a gas proration order issued by the Railroad Commission of Texas for the Panhandle fields on December 10, and carried forward in supplemental orders.1 The orders were entered under chapter of the Texas Acts Forty-Fourth Legislature, Regular Session, commonly known as House Bill (Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.Tex. art. Under the orders the production of sweet gas from the plaintiffs' wells is limited to an amount below their market requirements under existing contracts, below their present production, and below the capacity of their transportation and marketing facilities. It is charged that the purpose of so limiting the production is not to prevent waste, or to prevent invasion of the legal rights of co-owners in the common reservoir, but solely to compel the plaintiffs, and others similarly situated, to purchase gas from those well owners who have not provided themselves with a market and marketing facilities—well owners who under existing law are obliged to stop production, for want of a market, unless some marketing outlet is found.

Two suits to enjoin enforcement of the order were brought in the federal court for Western Texas. One was by Texas Panhandle Gas Utilities Company, for which Consolidated Gas Utilities Corporation has been substituted as plaintiff; the other by Texoma Natural Gas Company. In each suit the members of the Railroad Commission and the Attorney General of the State were made defendants. The properties for which the plaintiffs seek protection are their sweet gas wells and reserves in the Texas Panhandle; their pipe lines extending into other States; their compressors and marketing facilities for use in connection therewith; and contracts which they have made for the supply of the gas to distributors in other States. The plaintiffs claim that the order takes this property without warrant in law. They contend that the order is in excess of the authority which House Bill confers upon the commission; and that, if the statute be construed as conferring the authority exercised, it violates the Federal Constitution and that of the State. The District Judge issued a restraining order. The cases were considered together. The court, three judges sitting, granted temporary injunctions, Texas Panhandle Gas Co. v. Thompson (D.C.) and made them permanent, Consolidated Gas Utilities Corporation v. Thompson, The cases were consolidated for purposes of appeal. The jurisdiction, federal and equitable, was not questioned. The record is extensive; the findings of fact explicit; the briefs in this Court occupy over pages.

The Texas Panhandle contains the largest natural gas field in the United States, an enormous reservoir of natural gas and oil extending through seven counties for a distance of miles with a width of from 10 to 40 miles. The development of the gas industry which began there in 1926 has proceeded at a rapid rate since The field produces both sweet and sour gas.3 Wasteful use of sweet gas is prohibited by the statute; and, within the statutory definition, practically the only nonwasteful use is for heat and light. For such use there is substantially no local market,4 as the region is sparsely settled. Gas cannot be stored. To utilize the sweet gas of the Panhandle field, it must be delivered to the ultimate consumer by pipe lines in a continuous flow from the wells to the burner tips of the consumer. Prior to the entry of the orders challenged, the owners of approximatey 80 per cent. of the total area in the Panhandle fields proven productive of sweet gas had constructed six major pipe lines from the West Panhandle field,5 and three from the East Panhandle field, extending to Chicago, Des Moines, Omaha, Sioux City, Kansas City, St. Paul, Indianapolis, Denver, Minneapolis, Fort Worth, Dallas, and other distant points. Six or seven of these major pipe line companies, including the plaintiffs', have produced and transported to the markets only gas produced from their own leases.

Under the restrictions imposed by the present statute, there is substantially no market outlet for the sweet gas of these fields except such as may be provided by pipe lines. The owners of wells in the West Panhandle field, and of wells in the East Panhandle field, together representing about 20 per cent. of the proven reserves of sweet gas in the whole field, neither own nor control any pipe line. And they have no access to any;6 since none of the pipe lines here involved is a common carrier. The plaintiffs and most of the other owners of pipe lines have no economic occasion to purchase gas from wells of the non-pipe line producers, as the potential capacity of their own wells far exceeds their market demand.7 There appears no legal obstacle, under the law of Texas, to the construction of additional pipe lines to serve the owners of wells in the Panhandle fields now without such connections. It is said that there are communities in other States which would afford markets if pipe lines were constructed to reach them. But the financial difficulties are obvious.

5
Prior to House Bill several efforts, statutory and administrative, had been made to compel, or induce, the owners of existing pipe lines to purchase the seeet gas of those well owners who lack pipe line facilities. Orders entered under statutes enacted prior to were enjoined as unconstitutional or ultra vires.8 By chapter Forty-Third Legislature, Regular Session,9 the use of natural gas was permitted for other purposes than light or fuel, including the manufacture of natural gasoline, where no reasonable market for light or fuel was available to the owner. Production under authority of this statute and the permits issued thereunder was found to involve intolerable waste.10 Such was the situation when on May 1, 1935, the Legislature enacted House Bill (Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.Tex. art. , under which the order here challenged was issued.
5
6
The act undertakes by drastic provisions to end the waste of sweet gas. It provides:
6
7
'Sec. 3. The production, transportation, or use of natural gas in such manner, in such amount, or under such conditions as to constitute waste is hereby declared to be unlawful and is prohibited. The term 'waste' among other things shall specifically include: (then follow specifications (a) to (m) inclusive).
7
8
'(h) The production of natural gas in excess of transportation or market facilities, or reasonable market demand for the type of gas produced.' Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.Tex. art. 
8
9
The defendants contend that the act likewise requires restriction of production regardless of the existence of waste, for the adjustment of rights of owners in a common reservoir of gas. And, as we read the substance of defendants' argument, they also construe the statute as authorizing gas proration orders, to provide a market for the sweet gas of those wells which, because they lack pipe line connections, have heretofore sold their gas for inferior, wasteful uses. These claims are rested primarily on the following provision:
9
10
'Sec. 10. It shall be the duty of the Commission to prorate and regulate the daily gas well production from each common reservoir in the manner and method herein set forth. The Commission shall prorate and regulate such production for the protection of public and private interests: (a) In the prevention of waste as 'waste' is defined herein; (b) In the adjustment of correlative rights and opportunities of each owner of gas in a common reservoir to produce and use or sell such gas as permitted in this Article.' Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.Tex. art. 
10
11
This provision is supplemented by others including those set forth in the margin (Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.Tex. art. 1
11
12
On December 10, 1935, the Railroad Commission, after hearings held, issued the basic order here challenged, which provides, among other things:
12
13
'It is ordered, That effective, 7 o'clock A.M., December 11, 1935, the daily allowable gas production, computed on the basis set forth in House Bill No. is as follows:
13
14
 East Panhandle Field. cubic feet daily
 
 West Sweet Panhandle
 Field............... cubic feet daily
 
 West Sour Panhandle
 Field............... cubic feet daily
14
15
'It is ordered, That the daily allowable production of gas for individual wells in the East and West Panhandle Fields shall be determined by dividing the reasonable market demand into two parts, and that these parts shall be distributed to each well in proportion to the relative producing ability of these individual wells and the number of acres containing each of these wells, but in no case shall more than one hundred sixty ( acres in the East Panhandle Field and not more than Six Hundred Forty ( acres in the West Panhandle Field, in both sweet and sour zones, be allocated to any one well for the purpose of proration.
15
16
'It is ordered, That the total daily allowable production of gas from gas wells in the East and West Pan handle Fields shall be distributed and prorated among the individual wells on the following basis and in the following manner, to-wit: Fifty (50%) per cent. of the reasonable market demand of the field shall be allocated on the ratio of the individual well acreage to the sum of the total well acreage in the field; and fifty (50%) per cent. of the reasonable market demand of the field shall be allocated on the ratio of the individual well potential to the sum of the total well potentials in the field.'
16
17
The order reduces plaintiffs' allowable production to a volume far below their requirements. The plaintiffs and other pipe line owners acquired, at large cost, their markets in distant States and their transportation and marketing facilities.12 By means of their pipe lines all the sweet gas produced by the plaintiffs (and likewise all produced by other pipe line owners) was, and is, marketed under contracts with distant distributors, chiefly in other States. These markets are not free markets. The plaintiffs necessarily bound themselves to supply the requirements of the distributors; and the distributors bound themselves to take their requirements from the plaintiffs. In order to fulfill their contractual obligations, the plaintiffs developed the capacity of their wells and acquired large reserves to provide for their future needs so that they have no occasion to purchase gas from other wells. By limiting the plaintiffs' allowable production, the order disables them from performing their contracts unless they purchase gas from non-pipe line wells. Such purchases would at least involve the cost of the gas and the loss resulting from failure to make fuller use of their own property.
17
18
The plaintiffs do not contest that the State has power to conserve its natural resources for the public, as well as to protect private rights,13 or that the Legislature has power to confer upon the Railroad Commission authority to make and enforce regulations to that end; or that to limit production to the aggregate reasonable market demand is, as a conservation measure, clearly proper in the interest of the public and of the private persons owning the right to draw from a common reservoir; or that the commission has authority to issue regulations to that end. The plaintiffs do not deny that the Legislature may confer upon the Railroad Commission also authority to prorate the total allowable production among all the individual wells which draw from the common reservoir, provided the proration is in accordance with their respective market demands and due consideration is given to existing reserves. But they insist that House Bill (Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.Tex. art. has not conferred that authority. And as to the order, the plaintiffs assert that, while restrictive in form, it is in fact coercive; that its purpose and effect are not to prevent waste of gas in the common reservoir nor to prorate the opportunities of production as distinguished from marketing; that the limitation of the production of the wells is merely a device to compel the individual plaintiffs, and other pipe line owners, to purchase gas for which they have no need; that the real purpose and effect of the order are to prorate, not production, but distant markets and the facilities for serving them; and that, thus, the order takes their property without warrant in law.
18
19
First. Prior to the enactment of House Bill the property rights of the plaintiffs were substantially those conferred by the common law of the State. Under it, the owner of land has title to oil and gas in place and, likewise, to the oil and gas which migrate to formations under his land through drainge from other lands.15 Under that rule, he may produce all the oil and gas that will flow out of the well on his land, subject to the exercise by other landowners of the same right of capture through drilling offsetting wells, so as to get their full share.16 This common-law rule, declared in an unbroken line of authorities, has been widely applied.17 While a producer who negligently uses explosives in his operations will be liable if he causes physical damage to his neighbors' gas and oil bearing strata and thus impairs the productivity thereof,18 the common law of the State did not, apparently, afford a remedy against depleting the common supply by wasteful taking or use of oil or gas drawn from the wells on one's own property. But since the Legislature of the State has prohibited, or curbed, certain practices in the production of gas and oil which it recognized as wasteful.19
19
20
Second. The defendants contend that the order assailed is a regulation duly promulgated for the prevention of waste, and the protection of correlative rights of owners in the common pool, and was so applied. It may be assumed that House Bill should be construed as authorizing regulations to prevent waste, and to create and protect correlative rights of owners in a common reservoir of gas to their justly proportionate shares thereof, free of drainage to neighboring lands. It may be assumed, also, that the statute, so construed, is a valid exercise of the State's undoubted power to legislate to those ends; and that it validly delegates to the Railroad Commission authority to promulgate regulations therefor. It is settled that to all administrative regulations purporting to be made under authority legally delegated there attaches a presumption of the existence of facts justifying the specific exercise. Pacific States Box & Basket Co. v. White, But, obviously, the proration orders would not be valid if shown to bear no reasonable relation either to the prevention of waste or the protection of correlative rights, or if shown to be otherwise arbitrary. The plaintiffs have assumed the heavy burden of overcoming the presumption and of establishing that the order is an arbitrary taking of their property. They assert, among other things, that they have, at all times, conducted their operations prudently and without waste; that they have, in fact, taken only a small part of the gas in the ground which they own or lease; and that there is no present danger that the pipe line owners will, by continuing to operate as they have done, cause waste or prejudice either to any public interest, or to a property right of any other person. We think the plaintiffs have sustained the burden resting upon them. For their assertions are adequately supported by the following special findings of the lower court:
20
 'The owners of wells connected to pipe lines, including complainants have always produced their wells in a prudent and skilful manner and in accordance with the most approved methods of production, without committing or causing physical waste.'
21
 'Before House Bill went into effect, grossly wasteful practices in the production of natural gas in the Panhandle field were occurring,' but 'most of this waste was due to the extravagant production of natural gas from oil wells and to the production of gas from gas wells and processing such gas for the extraction of a very small quantity of natural gasoline therefrom and popping or wasting to the air the residue gas, which constituted 97% of the fuel value of the gas in its original state. * * * No evidence was offered—indeed, it was not even seriously claimed—that anything complainant had done or contemplated doing has, in the slightest degree, contributed or will contribute to that waste.'
22
 Even if the effect of the Texas legislation be to halt production by other well owners, 'the production from their own wells by complainant and other pipe lines of the quantity of gas required from time to time to fulfill their marketing contracts and requirements will cause no coning or channeling of water, no trapping off of recoverable oil or gas, no underground waste of oil, gas or reservoir energy or reduction of the total quantity of recoverable gas from the field, even though the other wells in the sweet gas area of the West Panhandle field be produced at a much lower rate or be not produced.'
23
 Large and wasteful production of gas in connection with production of oil in the Panhandle field, and, more recently, in connection with the operations of plants 'stripping' the gas of its natural gasoline content, 'has resulted in the migration of tremendous quantities of natural gas from the southwestern side of the field to the northeastern side of the field. Many of these areas of low pressure are situated in the sour gas producing area, with the result that tremendous quantities of sweet gas have moved out from the sweet gas area into the sour gas area,' and have thus become unfit for use as fuel for lighting and heating purposes. Drainage away from the areas of complainants' holdings is found to have been intensified by disproportionate production of gas from gas wells not connected to pipe lines. In the East Panhandle field 'the leases on which the wells connected to pipe lines are located have produced an average—(of) cubic feet of gas per acre, and those on which the wells connected to stripping plants are located have produced an average of cubic feet per acre.' In the West Panhandle field, production at the time of trial of this case had aggregated cubic feet. 'Of this total the pipe lines, with an ownership of 56% of the total reserves, have produced only cubic feet, while the owners of the other 44% have produced cubic feet. Complainant, with an ownership of approximately 20% of the total reserves, had produced only cubic feet, or of the total withdrawals from the West Panhandle field.' The average rock pressure of the wells not connected to pipe lines is materially lower than that of complainants' and other pipe line companies' wells. Hence, in the West Panhandle field, 'by reason of these fifferentials in pressure between the wells connected to pipe lines and those not connected, the migration or drainage as a whole is from the wells connected to pipe lines, including those connected to complainant's pipe lines, to the wells not connected to pipe lines.' Likewise, 'all along the northeast slope of the structure in the East Panhandle field there is an extremely low pressure area, where tremendous quantities of gas have been produced in connection with the operation of oil wells and wells connected to stripping plants. The general drainage in the East Panhandle field is from the areas of high pressure toward and to these low pressure areas. The majority of the wells not connected to pipe lines are situated in these low pressure areas, or between these low pressure areas and the high pressure areas to the south and west thereof, in which areas of higher pressure the wells connected to the pipe lines are situated. * * * Very large quantities of gas have migrated from the reserves of the pipe lines, including the reserves of complainants, to the low pressure areas in and around the oil fields on the northeast slope of the reservoir and to the areas on which most of the wells belonging to others than the pipe lines in the West Panhandle field are situated.' Further, past losses do not complete the story. 'Without regard to the rate of withdrawal in the existing areas of low pressure, the migration of gas from the reserves of the pipe lines to those areas of low pressure will continue over a long period of time.'
24
25
In the light of these findings the lower court concluded that the order was not intended to prevent waste attributable to plaintiffs; and that it was not intended to adjust correlative rights in the common reservoir for the purpose of averting unjust drainage from the reserves of those wells lacking pipe line connections. On the other hand, the court concluded that the proration ordered, with its drastic limitation of output from wells now connected to pipe lines, will obviously not protect those wells against undue drainage to other parts of the field, but will deprive their owners of the protection which fuller production would offer. These findings are adequately supported by the evidence.
25
26
On the other hand, the assertion of the defendants that the order will, by requiring a uniform and rateable system of production by all the wells, result in the ultimate recovery of a larger amount of gas than would otherwise be produced, and, likewise, the assertion that the plaintiffs, by their present production, are depriving, or threaten to deprive, non-pipe line owners of their opportunity to share rateably in the gas in the common reservoir, are not sustained. By the assignment of errors in this Court, defendants challenged the correctness of many of the findings. But we are of opinion that, so far as here material, all their contentions, and also the findings of the Railroad Commission in its order of December 10, prophesying 'waste' if the proration ordered is not carried out, are unfounded.
26
27
Third. The defendants contend, apparently, that House Bill should be construed as authorizing the Commission to reduce the production of the plaintiffs and of other pipe line owners, even if the sole purpose of doing so is to furnish a market for the sweet gas of those wells now without pipe line connections. On the other hand, the plaintiffs insist that House Bill should be construed as authorizing the proration of production only in connection with, and as part of, waste prevention; and that, since their operations do not involve or threaten waste, the order was without statutory authority. That contention the lower court sustained. It did so, on the ground that to authorize the restriction of nonwasteful production by the pipe line well owners solely for the purpose of compelling them to furnish other wells with a market would be a change of the common law of Texas so radical that, if the Legislature had so intended, it would have expressed that intention in language more explicit than any used in the act. Moreover, the court pointed out that, under the established rule of construction, the interpretation urged by defendants should be avoided because the statute so construed would be of doubtful validity.20
27
28
We are always reluctant to pass upon a seriously controverted question of the meaning of a state statute, because our decision, although disposing of the particular case, cannot settle the issue of the proper construction of the statute.21 No court of the State has construed the act. The defendants might, perhaps, have secured its construction by the state court. For the amendment of section of the Judicial Code made in 1913 provides that upon the institution of an appropriate suit in a state court a stay may be had of the proceedings in the federal court to await adjudication by the state court.22 But no suit in a state court was instituted by the defendants to that end. When not instructed by some decision of a state court, we are disposed, in exercising appellate jurisdiction, to accept the construction given by the lower federal court to a statute of the State, particularly when that court is composed, as in this in stance, wholly of citizens of the State, familiar with the history of the statute, the local conditions to which it applies, and the character of the State's laws.23 But, being under duty to make an independent study of the question, we have done so.24 That study leaves us in grave doubt whether the lower court has correctly interpreted the intention of the lawmakers.25 On the other hand, we are clearly of opinion that, if the act were construed as the defendants contend it should be, and as the commission has applied it, it would violate the Federal Constitution. As a general rule, it is no less true with reference to State than to Federal legislation that this Court will not decide an issue of constitutionality if the case may justly and reasonably be decided upon a construction of the statute under which the act is clearly constitutional. Compare Bratton v. Chandler, South Utah Mines & Smelters v. Beaver County, Hopkins v. Southern California Telephone Co., But where one party's case depends upon a construction of a state statute under which it plainly must be held to violate the Federal Constitution, and where the proper construction of the statute is a matter of grave doubt, this Court will rest its decision on the Constitution, and will not undertake to decide the question of construction as to which it lacks the power to give a definitive answer. Compare Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Kuykendall, Michigan Public Utilities Commission v. Duke, Sterling v. Constantin, We, therefore, accept, for the purposes of our decision, the defendants' construction; and pass to the discussion of constitutional questions.
28
29
Fourth. Either production greater than the demand or use for an inferior purpose would necessarily involve overground waste of gas. The manner, place, or extent of production might lead to underground waste. We assume that the prohibition of any wasteful conduct, whether primarily in behalf of other owners of gas in the common reservoir, or because of the public interests involved, is consistent with the Constitution of Texas and that of the United States, and that to prevent waste production may be prorated.26 We assume, also, that the State may constitutionally prorate production in order to prevent undue drainage of gas from the reserves of well owners lacking pipe line connections.27 If proration were lawfully applied for any such purposes, the fact that thereby other private persons would incidentally and gratuitously obtain important benefits would present no constitutional obstacle. And the fact that plaintiffs' gas is to be sold in interstate commerce would not preclude such exercise of the State's power. Compare Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Commission. 
29
30
But the sole purpose of the limitation which the order imposes upon the plaintiffs' production is to compel those who may legally produce, because they have market outlets for permitted uses, to purchase gas from potential producers whom the statute prohibits from producing because they lack such a market for their possible product. Plaintiff's operations are neither causing nor threatening any overground or underground waste. Every well owner in the field is free to produce the gas, provided he does not do so wastefully. He is legally and, so far as appears, physically free to provide himself with a market and with transportation and marketing facilities. There is no basis for a claim that his right, or opportunity, will be interfered with by a disproportionate taking by any one of those who may legally produce.
30
31
'The terms and provisions of the orders attacked, the necessary operation and effect of such orders, the history of the field and other pertinent facts as disclosed by this record conclusively establish that the purpose of the Commission underlying the orders was, upon a theory of protecting correlative rights to coerce complainant and other (others) similarly situated to buy gas from, and thus to share their private marketing contracts and commitments and the use of their pipe lines and other facilities for transmitting their gas to market with, the owners of wells not now connected to pipe lines, who have not contributed in money, services, negotiations, skill, forethought or otherwise to the development of such markets and the construction of such pipe lines and other facilities. In short to compel complainants to afford markets to those having none.
31
32
'The necessary operation and effect of such orders is to take from complainant and others similarly situated substantial and valuable interests in their private marketing contracts and commitments and in the use of their pipe lines and other facilities for transmitting their gas to their markets, without compensation, and to confer same upon the owners of the approximately sweet gas wells in the field not connected to pipe lines.'
32
33
The use of the pipe line owner's wells and reserves is curtailed solely for the benefit of other private well owners. The pipe line owner, a private person, is, in effect, ordered to pay money to another private well owner for the purchase of oil which there is no wish to buy.28 Moreover, he is thus prevented from protecting himself, to the extent that he is able to market his gas, against the losses which the court below finds are occurring and will continue to occur due to drainage from the high-pressure areas, wherein plaintiffs' wells are located, to the existing low-pressure areas, in which are located the majority of the wells not connected to pipe lines. There is here no taking for the public benefit; nor is payment of compensation provided. Plaintiffs' pipe lines are private property. So far as appears, they are constructed on private lands. There is no suggestion that any of them is a common carrier of gas. The purpose of the owners in constructing the pipe lines was for the transport of gas only from their own leases, and such has been their consistent policy. Unlike the property involved in The Assigned Car Cases, the pipe lines are not used in connection with the operation of any public utility in Texas.29
33
34
The purpose of this order is the same as that which the Legislature sought to achieve by the 'Common Purchaser Act,' of August 12, 1931, held unconstitutional in Texoma Natural Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission (D.C.) The effect upon the property of the pipe line owners of the two statutes and the orders issued thereunder is, likewise, the same. There is a difference in the means employed; but the difference is not of legal significance. The act attempted to compel the purchase by frankly commanding it, under sanctions criminal and civil. The act operates by indirection. Its command is no less compelling; its penalties not significantly different. The order disables the plaintiffs from performing their contracts except by means of purchases. Resort to those means necessarily results in depriving the plaintiffs of property. Under each statute, if obeyed, the State takes from the pipe line owner the money with which the purchase is made, the money lost through curtailed use of properties developed at large expense, the money lost because of the drainage away from his land of the gas which he is forbidden to produce for himself, but must buy from those towards whose lands it migrates.
34
35
Our law reports present no more glaring instance of the taking of one man's property and giving it to another. In Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. State of Nebraska, Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Nebraska, Ann.Cas. Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Cahill, Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R.R. Co. v. Morristown, and Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Ry. Co. v. Holmberg, expenditures directed to be made for the benefit of a private person were held invalid, although the party ordered to pay was a common carrier. In Citizens' Savings & Loan Association v. Topeka, and Cole v. La Grange, the payments ordered for the benefit of a private person were declared invalid, although the money was to be raised by general taxation. In Myles Salt Co., Ltd. v. Board of Commissioners, the exaction was held unlawful, though imposed under the guise of an assessment for alleged betterments. Compare Georgia Railway & Electric Co. v. Decatur, And this Court has many times warned that one person's property may not be taken for the benefit of another private person without a justifying public purpose, even though compensation be paid. See Hairston v. Danville and Western Ry. Co., Ann.Cas. Rindge Co. v. County of Los Angeles, Compare Cincinnati v. Vester. 
35
36
Fifth. The defendants contend that the situation in the Panhandle field presented a conflict of private interests so serious as to become a matter of public concern; and that the Legislature has power to adopt measures to prevent the harmful discord. They insist, moreover, that the plaintiffs, having invoked the legislative action to stop the wasteful and disproportionate drawing of sweet gas by others—a prohibition of which they are now reaping the benefits—may not deny the legislative power to authorize the incidental limitations of its own production; since the Legislature would not have prohibited the waste, or inferior uses of the gas, without providing for its purchase by the pipe line companies. Whether the latter assertion is true in fact, we do not know. But it is clear that there is no basis in law for the argument, since there is no claim that plaintiffs ever consented to inserting any such provision in the act. Indeed, they insist, as a matter of construction, that the Legislature has not done so. And House Bill is so much more drastic a statute than the restrictions upon inferior uses of gas which were apparently the object of plaintiffs' efforts before the Legislature that in their present situation plaintiffs cannot fairly be said to be receiving the benefits and evading the burdens of a measure which they initiated. Moreover, plaintiffs do not assert rights under the statute which they assail. They have not taken, and are not obliged to take, any affirmative steps thereunder to obtain whatever benefits may accrue to them because of the restrictions imposed on production for inferior uses. Compare Daniels v. Tearney, Wall v. Parrot Silver & Copper Co., Booth Fisheries Co. v. Industrial Commission, Those benefits result incidentally from the enactment of other provisions of the act, the constitutionality of which is not questioned, and which seem clearly separable from the sections here challenged. Compare Hurley v. Commission of Fisheries, United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission, 1

The complaints' original bills challenged earlier orders issued by the Railroad Commission under the Act here in question, notably the orders of August 28, and September 25, 1935. These orders were the subjects of temporary injunctions granted in Texas Panhandle Gas Co. v. Thompson (D.C.) Upon the issuance of the order of December 10, 1935, complainants amended their bills to make that order and its supplements the object of their attack.

Only sweet gas is fit for lighting and heating. Sour gas is that contaminated by sulphur compounds. It is now used in this field principally in the manufacture of carbon black. When the act was passed, plants supplying 70% of the carbon black manufactured in the United States were operating in this field.

3

4
The small market for sweet gas within the field is limited to fuel for the drilling of wells and the operation of industries incident to the oil and gas business; to small pipe lines supplying gas to communities near the field; and to purchases by two companies with pipe lines to distant cities. These have made 30 new connections with wells of others and are taking rateably from these wells.

4

5
For administrative purposes the territory is divided into the East Panhandle and the West Panhandle zones. The West zone alone contains any sour gas area. The sweet gas area of the West Panhandle field embraces acres. In it there are of which do not have an outlet for light and fuel purposes. The sweet gas area of the East Panhandle field embraces acres. In it there are wells, of which do not have an outlet for light and fuel purposes. Gas from the Panhandle field is supplied for domestic and industrial light and fuel purposes to approximately persons in the United States.

6
The only exception to this is in the case of the few independent wells with which two of the pipe line companies have made connections. See note 4, supra.

7
Thus at the time of the hearing below Texoma Natural Gas Company was producing its wells at the rate of about 10 per cent. of their daily potential capacity, and the average throughout the year, it was found, had been and would be substantially less than this figure. The highest percentage of the daily potential ever taken over a period of one month for all of the wells of Consolidated Gas Utilities Corporation has been per cent. The wells of other pipe line owners in these fields have likewise been produced at low percentages of capacity.

(a) Chapter Forty-Second Legislature, First Called Session (Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.Tex. art. ), known as the Common Purchaser Act, was construed and applied by the Railroad Commission as requiring private pipe line companies engaged theretofore only in producing and transporting gas from their own leases to purchase without discrimination, under regulations of the commission, quantities of gas offered them by producers in the field lacking their own pipe lines. The act was held unconstitutional as in violation of the due process and commerce clauses of the Federal Constitution, and enforcement of the orders was enjoined, in Texoma Natural Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission (D.C.) 
(b) Purporting to act under the general conservation laws of the State, as amended by chapter Forty-Second Legislature, First Called Session, the Railroad Commission subsequently issued orders completely closing down some portions of the Panhandle field, and limiting production from pipe line companies' wells in other portions. Enforcement of these orders was enjoined on the ground that the commission's action was ultra vires, in Texoma Natural Gas Co. v. Terrell (D.C.) 
(c) By chapter Forty-Second Legislature, Fourth Called Session, the Railroad Commission was meantime authorized, whenever the full production from wells producing gas from a common reservoir should exceed reasonable market demand, to limit production to such demand and allocate the allowable production. Orders purporting to be issued under the authority of this act were enjoined in Canadian River Gas Co. v. Terrell (D.C.) on the ground that they were ultra vires because the statute authorized regulation only to prevent waste, and the court concluded that the orders did not bear any reasonable relation to that end.
(d) Then followed the enactment of the statute now under consideration.

According to evidence presented by the State, in July, 1935, before the prohibitions of House Bill became effective against uses therein declared wasteful, there were in the West Panhandle field 41 stripping plants producing natural gasoline, consuming daily M.C.F. sweet gas, from which the gasoline production saved only 3 per cent. of the fuel value of the gas in its original state. Between February 1, 1933, and August 1, 1935, 709 billion cubic feet of gas were said to have been blown into the air after the natural gasoline content had been extracted.

'Section 1. Declaration of policy: In recognition of past, present, and imminent evils occurring in the production and use of natual (natural) gas, as a result of waste in the production and use thereof in the absence of correlative opportunities of owners of gas in a common reservoir to produce and use the same, this law is enacted for the protection of public and private interests against such evils by prohibiting waste and compelling ratable production.'
'Sec. 11. The Commission shall exercise the authority to accomplish the purpose designated under item (a) of Section 10 when the presence or imminence of waste is supported by a finding based
upon the evidence introduced at a hearing to be held as herein provided.
'The Commission shall exercise the authority to accomplish the purpose designated under item (b) of Section 10 when evidence introduced at a hearing to be held as herein provided will support a finding made by the Commission that the aggregate lawful volume of the open flow or daily potential capacity to produce of all gas wells located in a common reservoir, is in excess of the daily reasonable market demand for gas from gas wells that may be produced from such common reservoir, to be utilized as permitted in this Article.
'Sec. 12. On or before the twentieth (20th) day of each calendar month the Commission shall hold a hearing * * * for the purpose of determining the aggregate daily capacity to produce of all gas wells in a common reservoir, and as nearly as possible, the daily volume of gas from each common reservoir that will be produced from gas wells during the following month to be utilized as permitted in this Article. Upon such determination, the Commission, based upon evidence introduced at such hearing, shall allocate to each gas well producing gas from such common reservoir a percentage of the daily productive capacity of each well which may be produced daily during the following month from each gas well producing gas from such common reservoir. Such percentage of the daily producing capacity
of each well shall be regarded as its daily allowable production of such daily volume required for utilization from such common reservoir. * * *
'Sec. 14. It shall be the duty of the Commission, after notice and hearing, to ascertain and determine the reasonable market demand for gas from gas wells to be used for light and fuel purposes and for all other lawful purposes to which sweet gas may be put under the terms of this Article and by proper order to restrict the production of gas from all gas wells in said field producing such gas to an amount equal to market demand or to an amount which may be produced without waste as otherwise defined; provided, however, the production of such gas shall in any event be restricted to the amount of the reasonable market demand therefor. In such order the Commission shall allocate, distribute or apportion the total allowable production from such field among the various gas wells affected by the order on a reasonable basis, and as provided in Section 13. * * *
'Sec. 16. It shall be unlawful for any person to produce gas from a gas well as herein defined in excess of the daily allowable production in such schedule of allowable production. * * *
'Sec. 20. In the event the Commission finds that the owner of any gas well has failed or refused to utilize or sell the allowable production from his well when such owner has been offered a connection or market for such gas at a reasonable price, such well shall be excluded from consideration in allocating the daily allowable production from the reservoir or zone in which same is located until the owner thereof signifies to the Commission his desire to utilize or sell such gas. In all other cases all gas wells shall be taken into account in allocating the allowable production among wells producing the same type of gas.'

The Texoma Natural Gas Company (with an affiliate) has, at a cost of about $ acquired acres of leases in the West Panhandle field known to be capable of producing sweet gas; drilled about 90 wells; erected a compressor plant; constructed a pipe line to its Chicago market; and secured marketing contracts for distribution in other States. Similarly, the Consolidated Gas Utilities Company (with affiliates) has expended a smaller sum in acquiring and developing gas reserves in the East Panhandle field and in constructing pipe lines to, and securing contracts for marketing its gas in Kansas.

Section 59a of article 16 of the Constitution of Texas, which article was proclaimed October 2, 1917, provides, in part:
'The conservation and development of all of the natural resources of this State * * * and the preservation and conservation of all such natural resources of the State are each and all hereby declared public rights and duties; and the Legislature shall pass all such laws as may be appropriate thereto.'

House Bill amends article of the Revised Civil Statutes, which is the statute particularly dealing with the production and use of natural gas. That article was amended by chapter 26 of Acts of Forty-Second Legislature, First Called Session, p. 46, § 2. It was again amended by chapter of the Acts of called the 'Sour Gas Law,' Forty-Third Legislature, Regular Session, p. also by chapter 88 of the Acts of Forty-Third Legislature, First Called Session, p. which remained in force until August 1, 1935, when House Bill became effective.

300 U.S. 227
AETNA LIFE INS. CO. OF HARTFORD, CONN.,
v.
HAWORTH et al.*
Argued Feb. 4, 1937.
1
The question presented is whether the District Court had jurisdiction of this suit under the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act. Act of June Jud.Code § C.A. § 400 and note).1
1
2
The question arises upon the plaintiff's complaint which was dismissed by the District Court upon the ground that it did not set forth a 'controversy' in the constitutional sense and hence did not come within the legitimate scope of the statute. The decree of dismissal was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. We granted certiorari. November —-.
2
3
From the complaint it appears that plaintiff is an insurance company which had issued to the defendant Edwin P. Haworth five policies of insurance upon his life, the defendant Cora M. Haworth being named as beneficiary. The complaint set forth the terms of the policies. They contained various provisions which for the present purpose it is unnecessary fully to particularize. It is sufficient to observe that they all provided for certain benefits in the event that the insured became totally and permanently disabled. In one policy, for $ issued in 1911, the company agreed, upon receiving the requisite proof of such disability and without further payment of premiums, to pay the sum insured, and dividend additions, in twenty annual installments, or a life annuity as specified, in full settlement. In four other policies issued in respectively, for amounts aggregating $ plaintiff agreed upon proof of such disability to waive further payment of premiums, promising in one of the policies to pay a specified amount monthly and in the other three to continue the life insurance in force. By these four policies the benefits to be payable at death, and the cash and loan values to be available, were to be the same whether the premiums were paid or were waived by reason of the described disability.
3
4
The complaint alleges that in the insured ceased to pay premiums on the four policies last mentioned and claimed the disability benefits as stipulated. He continued to pay premiums on the first mentioned policy until and then claimed disability benefits. These claims, which were repeatedly renewed, were presented in the form of affidavits accompanied by certificates of physicians. A typical written claim on the four policies is annexed to the complaint. It states that while these policies were in force, the insured became totally and permanently disabled by disease and was 'prevented from performing any work or conducting any business for compensation or profit'; that on October 7, 1930, he had made and delivered to the company a sworn statement 'for the purpose of asserting and claiming his right to have these policies continued under the permanent and total disability provision contained in each of them'; that more than six months before that date he had become totally and permanently disabled and had furnished evidence of his disability within the stated time; that the annual premiums payable in the year or in subsequent years were waived by reason of the disability; and that he was entitled to have the policies continued in force without the payment of premiums so long as the disability should continue.
4
5
With respect to the policy first mentioned, it appears that the insured claimed that prior to June 1, 1934, when he ceased to pay premiums, he had become totally and permanently disabled; that he was without obligation to pay further premiums and was entitled to the stipulated disability benefits including the continued life of the policy.
5
6
Plaintiff alleges that consistently and at all times it has refused to recognize these claims of the insured and has insisted that all the policies had lapsed according to their terms by reason of the non-payment of premiums, the insured not being totally and permanently disabled at any of the times to which his claims referred. Plaintiff further states that taking loans into consideration four of the policies have no value and the remaining policy (the one first mentioned) has a value of only $45 as extended insurance. If, however, the insured has been totally and permanently disabled as he claims, the five policies are in full force, the plaintiff is now obliged to pay the accrued installments of cash disability benefits for which two of the policies provide, and the insured has the right to claim at any time cash surrender values accumulating by reason of the provisions for waiver of premiums, or at his death, Cora M. Haworth, as beneficiary, will be entitled to receive the face of the policies less the loans thereon.
6
7
Plaintiff thus contends that there is an actual controversy with defendants as to the existence of the total and permanent disability of the insured and as to the continuance of the obligations asserted despite the nonpayment of premiums. Defendants have not instituted any action wherein the plaintiff would have an opportunity to prove the absence of the alleged disability and plaintiff points to the danger that it may lose the benefit of evidence through disappearance, illness, or death of witnesses; and meanwhile, in the absence of a judicial decision with respect to the alleged disability, the plaintiff in relation to these policies will be compelled to maintain reserves in excess of $.
7
8
The complaint asks for a decree that the four policies be declared to be null and void by reason of lapse for nonpayment of premiums and that the obligation upon the remaining policy be held to consist solely in the duty to pay the sum of $45 upon the death of the insured, and for such further relief as the exigencies of the case may require.
8
9
First.—The Constitution (article 3, § 2) limits the exercise of the judicial power to 'cases' and 'controversies.' 'The term 'controversies,' if distinguishable at all from 'cases,' is so in that it is less comprehensive than the latter, and includes only suits of a civil nature.' Per Mr. Justice Field in Re Pacific Railway Commission (C.C.) citing Chisholm v. Georgia, See Muskrat v. United States, Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, The Declaratory Judgment Act of in its limitation to 'cases of actual controversy,' manifestly has regard to the constitutional provision and is operative only in respect to controversies which are such in the constitutional sense. The word 'actual' is one of emphasis rather than of definition. Thus the operation of the Declaratory Judgment Act is procedural only. In providing remedies and defining procedure in relation to cases and controversies in the constitutional sense the Congress is acting within its delegated power over the jurisdiction of the federal courts which the Congress is authorized to establish. Turner v. Bank of North America, Stevenson v. Fain, Kline v. Burke Construction Co., Exercising this control of practice and procedure the Congress is not confined to traditional forms or traditional remedies. The judiciary clause of the Constitution 'did not crystallize into changeless form the procedure of as the only possible means for presenting a case or controversy otherwise cognizable by the federal courts.' Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis R. Co. v. Wallace, In dealing with methods within its sphere of remedial action the Congress may create and improve as well as abolish or restrict. The Declaratory Judgment Act must be deemed to fall within this ambit of congressional power, so far as it authorizes relief which is consonant with the exercise of the judicial function in the determination of controversies to which under the Constitution the judicial power extends.
9
10
A 'controversy' in this sense must be one that is appropriate for judicial determination. Osborn v. Bank of United States, 204. A justiciable controversy is thus distinguished from a difference or dispute of a hypothetical or abstract character; from one that is academic or moot. United States v. Alaska S.S. Co., The controversy must be definite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests. South Spring Gold Co. v. Amador Gold Co., Fairchild v. Hughes, Massachusetts v. Mellon, It must be a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts. See Muskrat v. United States, supra; Texas v. Interstate Commerce Commission, New Jersey v. Sargent, Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Grannis, New York v. Illinois, Willing v. Chicago Auditorium Association, Arizona v. California, Alabama v. Arizona, United States v. West Virginia, Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, Where there is such a concrete case admitting of an immediate and definitive determination of the legal rights of the parties in an adversary proceeding upon the facts alleged, the judicial function may be appropriately exercised although the adjudication of the rights of the litigants may not require the award of process or the payment of damages. Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis R. Co. v. Wallace, supra, at page Tutun v. United States, Fidelity National Bank & Trust Co. v. Swope, Old Colony Trust Company v. Commissioner, supra, at page And as it is not essential to the exercise of the judicial power that an injunction be sought, allegations that irreparable injury is threatened are not required. Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis R. Co. v. Wallace, supra, at page .
10
11
With these principles governing the application of the Declaratory Judgment Act, we turn to the nature of the controversy, the relation and interests of the parties, and the relief sought in the instant case.
11
12
Second—There is here a dispute between parties who face each other in an adversary proceeding. The dispute relates to legal rights and obligations arising from the contracts of insurance. The dispute is definite and concrete, not hypothetical or abstract. Prior to this suit, the parties had taken adverse positions with respect to their existing obligations. Their contentions concerned the disability benefits which were to be payable upon prescribed conditions. On the one side, the insured claimed that he had become totally and permanently disabled and hence was relieved of the obligation to continue the payment of premiums and was entitled to the stipulated disability benefits and to the continuance of the policies in force. The insured presented this claim formally, as required by the policies. It was a claim of a present, specific right. On the other side, the company made an equally definite claim that the alleged basic fact did not exist, that the insured was not totally and permanently disabled and had not been relieved of the duty to continue the payment of premiums, that in consequence the policies had lapsed, and that the company was thus freed from its obligation either to pay disability benefits or to continue the insurance in force. Such a dispute is manifestly susceptible of judicial determination. It calls, not for an advisory opinion upon a hypothetical basis, but for an adjudication of present right upon established facts.
12
13
That the dispute turns upon questions of fact does not withdraw it, as the respondent seems to contend, from judicial cognizance. The legal consequences flow from the facts and it is the province of the courts to ascertain and find the facts in order to determine the legal consequences. That is everyday practice. Equally unavailing is respondent's contention that the dispute relates to the existence of a 'mutable fact' and a 'changeable condition—the state of the insured's health.' The insured asserted a total and permanent disability occurring prior to October, 1930, and continuing thereafter. Upon that ground he ceased to pay premiums. His condition at the time he stopped payment, whether he was then totally and permanently disabled so that the policies did not lapse, is not a 'mutable' but a definite fact. It is a controlling fact which can be finally determined and which fixes rights and obligations under the policies. If it were found that the insured was not totally and permanently disabled when he ceased to pay premiums and hence was in default, the effect of that default and the consequent right of the company to treat the policies as lapsed could be definitely and finally adjudicated. If it were found that he was totally and permanently disabled as he claimed, the duty of the company to pay the promised disability benefits and to maintain the policies in force could likewise be adjudicated. There would be no difficulty in either event in passing a conclusive decree applicable to the facts found and to the obligations of the parties corresponding to those facts. If the insured made good his claim, the decree establishing his right to the disability benefits, and to the continuance of the policies in force during the period of the proved disability, would be none the less final and conclusive as to the matters thus determined even though a different situation might later arise in the event of his recovery from that disability and his failure after that recovery to comply with the requirements of the policies. Such a contention would present a distinct subject matter.
13
14
If the insured had brought suit to recover the disability benefits currently payable under two of the policies there would have been no question that the controversy was of a justiciable nature, whether or not the amount involved would have permitted its determination in a federal court. Again, on repudiation by the insurer of liability in such a case and insistence by the insured that the repudiation was unjustified because of his disability, the insured would have 'such an interest in the preservation of the contracts that he might maintain a suit in equity to declare them still in being.' Burnet v. Wells, Cohen v. New York Life Insurance Co., Fidelity National Bank & Trust Co. v. Swope, supra. But the character of the controversy and of the issue to be determined is essentially the same whether it is presented by the insured or by the insurer. Whether the District Court may entertain such a suit by the insurer, when the controversy as here is between citizens of different States or otherwise is within the range of the federal judicial power, is for the Congress to determine. It is the nature of the controversy, not the method of its presentation or the particular party who presents it, that is determinative. See Gully v. Interstate Natural Gas Co. (C.C.A.) Travelers Insurance Co. v. Helmer (D.C.) New York Life Insurance Co. v. London (D.C.) .
14
15
We have no occasion to deal with questions that may arise in the progress of the cause, as the complaint has been dismissed in limine. Questions of burden of proof or mode of trial have not been considered by the courts below and are not before us.
15
16
Our conclusion is that the complaint presented a controversy to which the judicial power extends and that authority to hear and determine it has been conferred upon the District Court by the Declaratory Judgment Act. The decree is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.
16
17
Reversed.

The act provides:
'(1) In cases of actual controversy * * * the courts of the United States shall have power upon petition, declaration, complaint, or other appropriate pleadings to declare rights and other legal relations of any interested party petitioning for such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be prayed, and such declaration shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and be reviewable as such.
'(2) Further relief based on a declaratory judgment or decree may be granted whenever necessary or proper. The application shall be by petition to a court having jurisdiction to grant the relief. If the application be deemed sufficient, the court shall, on reasonable notice, require any adverse party, whose rights have been adjudicated by the declaration, to show cause why further relief should not be granted forthwith.

300 U.S. 258
HENDERSON CO.
v.
THOMPSON et al.
Argued Feb. 2, 3, 1937.
1
The question for decision is whether the prohibition by Texas of the use of sweet natural gas for the manufacture of carbon black in the Panhandle field is valid.
1
2
The suit is brought in the federal court for western Texas by the Henderson Company, a Maine corporation. It challenges the validity of the following provisions of chapter of the Acts of the Legislature of Texas, Forth-Fourth Regular Session (Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.Tex. art. , commonly known as House Bill subdivisions (g) and (h) of section 2, which define sweet and sour gas;1 subdivision (j) of section 3, which prohibits the use of sweet gas for the manufacture of carbon black;2 and subdivision (1) of section 7, which defines the purposes for which sweet gas may be used.3 See Thompson v. Consolidated Gas Utilities Corporation, decided by this Court February 1, 1937. The suit challenges, also, the validity of orders entered by the Railroad Commission pursuant to the statute.
2
3
The Henderson Company owns and operates in the Panhandle gas field a casinghead gasoline plant which is connected with 21 gas wells; holds oil and gas leases under which some of these wells are operated; and is under contract to take gas from the other wells. Prior to the statute, it received at its plant the gas from all these wells; extracted therefrom the gasoline content; and had contraced to supply the residue gas to the Combined Carbon Company. The orders challenged classified fourteen of the wells as sweet gas wells and prohibited both taking the gas therefrom for the purpose of processing the same for its gasoline content and delivery of the residue for the manufacture of carbon black. The seven remaining wells, classified as sour, cannot furnish the quantity of gas required by the company in its gasoline plant and to perform its contract with the Cabon Company. A supply from other sour gas wells is not available; and for the gas from the fourteen wells classified as sweet there is no other use.
3
4
The bill charges that the statute and the orders entered thereunder violate the Federal Constitution—the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Contract Clause (article 1, § 10, cl. 1); also provisions of the Constitution of Texas. The members of the Commission and the Attorney General of Texas are made defendants. The relief sought is to enjoin enforcement of the statute temporarily and permanently.
4
5
The jurisdiction, federal and equitable, was not questioned. Answers were filed. An application for a restraining order was denied. That for a preliminary injunction, promptly heard before three judges, was also denied (D.C.) And on final hearing upon an extensive record a decree was entered denying the permanent injunction and dismissing the bill (D.C.) Findings of fact and conclusions of law were filed in compliance with Equity Rule C.A. following section . The case is here on appeal.
5
6
The findings contain, as in Thompson v. Consolidated Gas Utilities Corporation, a description of the character and the development of the Panhandle gas field. In the western field the sweet gas zone lies to the south, occupying about two-thirds of it; the sour gas zone lies to the north and occupies about one-third. Plants which strip the gas of its gasoline content and carbon black plants which use the residue are apparently accessible to both zones. For those purposes either sweet or sour gas can be used. For the sweet gas of the Panhandle field there is also a large demand for fuel and light. For the sour gas in its natural state there is practically no use other than in the stripping and the carbon black plants. There are 29 carbon black plants in the Panhandle field. These produce more than 70 per cent. of all carbon black manufactured in the United States; and they consume, on the average, about cubic feet per day. Intolerable waste had resulted by use of sweet gas under permits issued by the Railroad Commission under chapter Forty-Third Legislature, Regular Session, which allowed the use of sweet gas for inferior purposes where there was no fuel and light market. It was primarily to prevent such waste that the Legislature prohibited by House Bill the use of sweet gas in the manufacture of carbon black.
6
7
'There is enough sour gas in reserve in the Panhandle field to fulfill the world's requirements of carbon black for many years to come. There is also a tremendous supply of casinghead gas in the Panhandle field. There is now available for use in the manufacture of carbon black sufficient allotments under the orders of the Railroad Commission of sour and casinghead gas to supply all the demands and needs of such plants with an excess of cubic feet of casinghead gas over and above the demand of the carbon black plants.
7
8
'* * * A producer of sweet gas, if he is able to market the same for light and fuel purposes, receives about three or four cents per cubic feet in the field. When such gas is delivered at the burner tips it sells for various greater amounts. The producers of gas who sell to the companies who strip it and burn it for carbon black receive less than a cent per cubic feet.'
8
9
The company contends that our decision in Walls v. Midland Carbon Co., which upheld certain action of Wyoming in prohibiting as wasteful the use of natural gas for the production of carbon black, is inapplicable to the issues here presented. The company concedes that Texas may, for the purpose of preventing waste, regulate both the production and the use of natural gas. It does not deny that when one natural resource is fitted for two uses and another resource only for one, the Legislature has the power to marshal these resources by classifying them, and designating the uses to which each may be put. Nor does it deny that the classification and the limitation of the use of sweet gas may 'when considering all of the gas fields in Texas as a whole, bear a reasonable relation to the purposes sought to be accomplished.' But it insists that as applied to the Panhandle field the classification and prohibition are void, because, there, they bear no reasonable relation to the object sought to be attained, and are arbitrarily discriminatory.
9
10
First. The contention that in the Panhandle field the prohibition of the use of sweet gas in the manufacture of carbon black is arbitrary and unreasonable rests primarily upon the fact that the sour and the sweet gas wells are in the same reservoir. The argument is that pressures in the sour gas area are lower than those in the sweet gas area; that, since there is no free market for sweet gas for fuel and light, it will, if not used in carbon black manufacture, and if withdrawals of sour gas are permitted to the extent of the requirements of the carbon black industry, migrate into lower pressure areas and become a part of the sour gas supply; that, therefore, the supply of sweet gas will not be conserved; and that the effect of the prohibition of its use in the manufacture of carbon black will be merely to deprive the company, through the migration, of the gas to which it is entitled. But the lower court found that the length of time required for such migration is not definitely known and that the demand for sweet gas for fuel and light is increasing. The needs of conservation are to be determined by the Legislature. See Walls v. Midland Carbon Co., The loss of sweet gas by migration may be relatively negligible. The court concluded that there is 'an abundance of factual support for the legislative prohibition against the burning of sweet gas for carbon black.' No facts have been found, or established by the evidence, which would justify us in pronouncing the action of the Legislature arbitrary.
10
11
Second. The company insists, also, that the prescribed prohibition is void because the difference between sweet gas and sour is solely the presence in the latter of a quantity of hydrogen sulphide; that by processing the sulphide can be eradicated from sour gas at a slight expense; and that the sour gas when so purified is fit for use for fuel and light. The distinction between sweet and sour gas fixed by the Legislature at 1 1/2 grains of hydrogen sulphide per cubic feet, is found by the court to be apt. The evidence as to the cost of purifying is widely conflicting. The cost might depend, among other things, upon the extent of the sulphur content. The classification made has ample support in the evidence. We are unable to find in the regulation anything arbitrary or unreasonable. Compare Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., Ann.Cas. Walls v. Midland Carbon Co., supra. 
11
12
Third. The company contends that the provisions of the statute as applied discriminate unreasonably between it and other producers similarly situated. The statute applies equally to all sweet gas wells. The discrimination suggested is in favor of the sour gas well owners. The argument is that the company has now no fuel and light market for its sweet gas; that gas may drain into a sour well; and, if it does, will become sour and be usable in the manufacture of carbon black. It is not known when the expected drainage will occur. Long before that time there may be a fuel and light market for the company's sweet gas. It is also urged that the statute discriminates illegally by prohibiting the use of sweet gas in carbon black manufacture while permitting its use as fuel by manufacturers of other articles. There are several differences which would justify the classification. Among them, this: The daily average consumption of the 29 carbon black plants is only slightly less than the average daily amount taken by the pipe lines for fuel and light purposes. For the carbon black plants in the Panhandle field the sour gas there affords an ample supply. For the fuel uses served by the interstate pipe lines sweet gas is practically indispensable. Compare Ohio Oil Co. v. Indiana (No. Walls v. Midland Carbon Co., supra. 
12
13
Fourth. The company claims that the statute impairs the obligation of contracts, since it prohibits performance of the company's contracts with producers to take sweet gas for its stripping plant and its contract to deliver the residue after stripping to the Combined Carbon Company. The contention is that the contract clause of the Texas Constitution (article 1, § 16), unlike that of the federal Constitution, prevents the State from enacting a police measure which will result in impairing a contract. In support of that proposition, the company cites Travelers' Ins. Co. v. Marshall, S.W.( decided by the Supreme Court of Texas in 1934. But that case does not support the proposition. The statute there held void was a moratorium statute specifically directed against the terms of contracts. The statute here challenged is not directed against any term of any contract. It deals merely with the use of an article of commerce; and its effect upon contracts is incidental. The distinction was pointed out by the district court, which said that the Constitution of the State of Texas 'has never been held to avoid a police statute dealing directly with physical things in the interest of the public welfare, and touching contractual relationships only incidentally as they may have attached to those physical things prior to the passage of the statute.' That ruling accords with constitutional doctrine long established in this and other courts. If we felt any doubt as to its application here, in the absence of a definitive construction of the Constitution of the State by its highest court, we should defer to the federal court's understanding of the state law. See Thompson v. Consolidated Gas Utilities Corporation, decided February 1, 1937.
13
14
Fifth. The contention that our decision in the Walls Case is inapplicable is rested in part on the difference, as to the title to gas in place, between the law of Wyoming and that of Texas. It is urged that, in the absence of waste, the legislature lacks power to regulate production in Texas, since there the law gives the owner of land title to the gas in place and to that which migrates to formations under his land; whereas in Wyoming regulation for the purpose of protecting correlative rights of other owners in a common pool is permissible. Upon this argument we need not pass. One principle established by the Walls Case is that the Legislature may, for the purpose of conserving natural resources, regulate their production and use. The findings of the district court in this case support the reasonableness of the present statute on that basis. It is also urged that there is this vital difference in the facts: that in the Panhandle field the challenged prohibition will not prevent waste, or conserve the supply of sweet gas, since the sweet gas, if not used, will drain into the sour gas area, because of the lower pressures there. Moreover, it is insisted that, unlike the Walls Case, there is here in the record convincing evidence that the use of sweet gas in the manufacture of carbon black is not wasteful. Our decision in that case rested upon no particular theory of the nature of the carbon black industry. It was based simply upon the determination that the statute in question was not shown to have been an arbitrary exercise of legislative power. Such, likewise, is our judgment here.

HELVERING, Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
v.
TEX-PENN OIL CO. SAME v. BENEDUM. SAME v. PARRIOTT.
Reargued Feb. 1, 2, 1937.
1
In each of these cases there is involved an item claimed by petitioner to be taxable income of respondent for the Commissioner gave notice of deficiencies. These claims were based on a transaction in 1919 which included transfer by Tex-Penn Oil Company of all its assets to Transcontinental Oil Company, the issue and delivery by the latter of shares to Benedum and Parriott, the stockholders of Tax-Penn, and the dissolution of that company. The Commissioner claims that the consideration for the transfer included not only the stock but also $in cash paid by Transcontinental to Tax-Penn. Respondents petitioned the Board of Tax Appeals for redetermination. The cases were consolidated for hearing; the Board made findings of circumstantial facts on the basis of which it concluded in an 'ultimate finding' that the consideration for the transfer by Tex-Penn to Transcontinental included cash, and that therefore the transaction was not one in which, under Revenue Act of 'no gain or loss shall be deemed to occur.' It redetermined deficiencies of $ respectively. Respondents petitioned the Circuit Court of Appeals for review. It reversed the orders with directions that the Board enter judgments of no deficiencies. Tex-Penn Oil Co. v. Com'r. 
1
2
1. The first ultimate finding is (: 'The consideration received by Tex-Penn on or about August 1, 1919, in exchange for its assets consisted of $in cash and shares of Transcontinental stock of no par value.'
2
3
The first question for decision is whether that conclusion in supported by evidence. If well grounded, the transaction is not within the nonrecognition of gain provision of section b). That section declares that 'when in connection with the reorganization, merger, or consolidation of a corporation a person receives in place of stock or securities owned by him new stock or securities of no greater aggregate par or face value, no gain or loss shall be deemed to occur from the exchange, and the new stock or securities received shall be treated as taking the place of the stock, securities, or property exchanged.'

4
Treasury Regulations contains an interpretation of that provision: 'In general where two (or more) corporations unite their properties by * * * the sale of its property by B to A and the dissolution of B * * * no taxable income is received from the transaction * * * provided the sole consideration received by B and its stockholders * * * is stock * * * of A * * *'
4
5
The pertinent substance of the circumstantial facts found follows:
5
and early respondents Benedum and Parriott and three others, Kirkland, Lantz, and Wrather, acquired 31 Texas oil and gas leases called the 'Duke-Knoles' group. The leases reserved to lessors a one-eighth royalty. The interest of the five in what the findings refer to as the remaining seven-eighths interest were Benedum six-sixteenths, Parriott and Kirkland three-sixteenths each, Lantz and Wrather two-sixteenths each.
6
7
In October, 1918, they caused Tex-Penn to be incorporated. Its authorized capital stock was $ divided into shares of $25 each. It issued shares for par to the five lease owners ratably according to their interests; they transferred a fourth interest in the leases to the company. It agreed to develop the properties at its own expense; they agreed that one-half of their shares of the proceeds might be used to make up deficits in the company's operating expenses.
7
8
They authorized Parriott to receive their shares of the proceeds, to carry out the agreement with the company, and to invest the remaining half of the proceeds in the company's stock. Accounts of transactions between the company and him, as agent, were kept under the name of 'Parriott Attorney.' Pursuant to the agreement, he from time to time purchased at par stock of the company amounting to shares; it used the money in developing the leased properties.
8
9
Benedum and Parriott were also interested as owners in the Riverside Eastern Oil Company, the Riverside Western Oil Company, and the Pittsburgh-Texas Oil & Gas Company. In early they decided to cause to be organized the Transcontinental Oil Company to acquire and operate the properties of these companies and of Tex-Penn together with the individually owned interests in the leases. Benedum's four associates, by writing dated June 2, gave him authority to sell the assets of Tex-Penn and all individual interests in the leases for $ and agreed to accept their pro rata share of the net proceeds of the sale for their holdings in Tex-Penn and their individual interests in the leases.
9
10
To arrange for money with which to carry out the project, Benedum negotiated with bankers. Under the first plan, the bankers were to pay Transcontinental $for a part of its stock, and that amount was to be used to pay the $in equal parts to Riverside Eastern and Riverside Western to retire preferred stock. The balance, $ was to be retained by Transcontinental for working capital. By a later arrangement the amount to be paid by the bankers was reduced to $and that to be received by the five individuals to $ Benedum's associates declined to accept less than their proportionate share of $as originally planned. In order that the undertaking should not fail, Benedum agreed to diminish by $the amount he was to have and so bore the entire reduction. On that basis, distribution of the would be $each to Benedum, Lantz, and Wrather and $each to Parriott and Kirkland.
10
11
Transcontinental was organized and authorized to issue no-par-value shares, of which the bankers agreed to buy per share. They exercised an option to buy additional shares at $1 per share. Tex-Penn's assets were to pass to Transcontinental free and clear of all liabilities. July 12, Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather assigned and delivered their Tex-Penn shares to Benedum and Parriott for $ the stock was transferred on the Tex-Penn stock book. July 22, new directors were elected to take the places of the assignors who, as stated in the minutes, had ceased to be stockholders.
11
12
July 14, the individual owners and Tex-Penn executed an assignment to Transcontinental of all their interest in the leases and gave it to Parriott in escrow for delivery upon payment of $to Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather, or to Parriott for their account. They stipulated that if payment was not made by August 1, the assignment and stock would be returned to them. And, in order that Tex-Penn assets might be free from liability, they authorized Parriott to deduct from their shares seven-sixteenths of not exceeding $to pay debts and obligations of the company. Benedum and Parriott were to bear nine-sixteenths. The auditor of Tex-Penn reported that approximately $would be required.
12
13
July 24, Benedum and Parriott made a contract with J. M. Holliday, acting for the bankers and Transcontinental, in which they agreed to transfer to Transcontinental their interests in the leases for $in cash, to cause Tex-Penn to transfer to Transcontinental all its assets 'for and in consideration of * * * $in cash and * * * shares of the capital stock of * * * Transcontinental,' and to cause Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather to transfer to Transcontinental their seven-sixteenths of the five-eighths interest in the leases for $in cash.
13
14
The same day, Holliday addressed an offer to Tex-Penn to purchase all its assets 'for * * * $in cash and * * * shares' of Transcontinental. By resolution of its directors, Tex-Penn accepted the offer, referring to the consideration as '$cash and * * * shares' of Transcontinental. It was further resolved that, after the transfer of its property, the collection of debts due, and payment of those owed by, Tex-Penn, it would be dissolved and its assets distributed to its stockholders 'and that to facilitate this, the * * * officers * * * direct Mr. Holliday that * * * $* * * shall be paid to the treasury of this company, and that the * * * shares * * * be issued and delivered to' Benedum and Parriott jointly.
14
15
July 30, Tex-Penn conveyed its assets to Transcontinental. Holliday directed the latter to deliver to Benedum and Parriott jointly certificates for shares, to deliver $to Parriott Attorney, $to Benedum and Parriott and $to Tex-Penn. The next day, these directions were carried out by Transcontinental.
15
16
There was available for use by Tex-Penn in payment of its expenses $ derived from one-half of the proceeds from the individually owned five-eighths interest in the leases. It also had receivables and oil and the $with which to discharge its liabilities. The $was deducted by Transcontinental from the amount to be paid Benedum and Parriott for their interest in the leases. But that deduction was in fact borne not by them alone, but ratably by the five owners. Payment of Tex-Penn's liabilities did not require use of all the $ There remained $ And that sum was distributed to the five individuals according to their interests in the leases.
16
17
Details are reflected in the accounts of 'Parriott Attorney.' Kirkland was given credit for $and Lantz and Wrather for $each as purchase prices of their shares of the five-eighths interest in the leases. Each of the five, according to his interest in the leases, was charged with his share of the $with the explanation that 'this amount was to be apportioned against the sale price received by all the individual interests.'3
17
18
In respect of the transfer of the Tex-Penn stock by Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather to Benedum and Parriott, the latter were charged $15 each and correspondingly each of the former was credited with $10. At the end of the year, Parriott furnished annual statements to Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather, showing the sale prices of their interests in the leases reduced by their contributions to the $ The sales price of the stock sold by them was shown at $30.
18
19
On partial distributions by Parriott before final settlement, Kirkland, Lantz, and Wrather gave receipts similar in form. That of Kirkland recited that the payment was on account of the purchase price of his interest 'in and to * * * the leases * * * and to the stock of the Tex-Penn. * * * The balance * * * is to be retained until the final adjustment of the taxes and the affairs of * * * Tex-Penn * * * at the conclusion of which the said balance is to be paid to me, less my proportionate share of said expenses.' Kirland and Lantz died before the hearing. Wrather testified that he attached no great importance to the form of the receipt; that he knew there had been in form separate transfers of the lease interests and the Tex-Penn stock but that he and his associates considered only the ultimate objective.
19
20
Benedum and Parriott in their income tax returns reported their own profits from the sale of their lease interests upon the basis of the total price of $ Tex-Penn's return stated that it had sold its assets for $cash and shares of stock. It also stated that the cost of the assets sold was.$ from which it deducted $ and that amount was designated 'value of stock.' Neither the $nor the stated 'value of stock' received was included in gross income. A schedule attached to the return stated that the cash consideration was accounted for in the return, and that the 'no par value stock' received was not taxable income under section .
20
21
The foregoing includes the substance of all the findings of circumstantial facts material to the question under consideration. They must be taken as established if supported by substantial evidence. Helvering v. Rankin, Old Mission Co. v. Helvering, Burnet v. Leininger, Phillips v. Commissioner, Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, There is no suggestion that they are not amply sustained. In addition to and presumably upon the basis of these findings the Board made its 'ultimate finding.' And upon that determination it ruled that the transaction was not within the nonrecognition provisions of section b). The ultimate finding is a conclusion of law or at least a determination of a mixed question of law and fact. It is to be distinguished from the findings of primary, evidentiary, or circumstantial facts. It is subject to judicial review and, on such review, the court may substitute its judgment for that of the Board. Helvering v. Rankin, ubisupra.
21
22
Treating the transaction as a part of reorganization, merger, or consolidation, of reorganization, merger, or consolidation, the Board concluded that cash constituted a part of the consideration. The opinion refers to writings above mentioned and emphasizes their provisions that state or indicate that the consideration was to or did include cash and stock. The documents cited are the agreement for the transfer of Tex-Penn's assets to Transcontinental, the offer to Tex-Penn, the resolution of its directors accepting the offer and directing payment of the $to its treasury, Holliday's letter directing Transcontinental so to pay, Transcontinental's check for that amount to Tex-Penn and the latter's tax return.
22
23
But the Board's findings of what was actually done show that, pursuant to direction of the individuals selling lease interests, Transcontinental advanced to Tex-Penn $and deducted that amount from the price of the lease interests. The findings also show that, for the part of that amount remaining after payment of its debts, Tex-Penn accounted to the individuals.
23
24
As indirectly showing that the $constituted part of the consideration for transfer of Tex-Penn assets, the opinion cites the entry in the 'Parriott Attorney' accounts showing that the effect of the payment of that sum to Tex-Penn was to reduce the sale price of the interest in the leases from $ the entries distributing that amount to the five individuals, and the tax returns of Benedum, Parriott, and Tex-Penn.
24
25
Petitioner does not bring forward these entries or the tax returns of Benedum and Parriott to support the Board's ultimate finding now under consideration. Manifestly, the entries referred to in the Board's opinion are opposed to its conclusion. As will more fully appear, upon an examination of them later to be made, the findings of details make it plain that the $was a part of the consideration paid for the individually owned lease interests and leave no ground for any other inference.
25
26
The Board's opinion shows that both parties relied on art. as a correct interpretation of the statute. The Board held ( that it 'requires, as a condition of nonrecognition of gain, that the sole consideration be stock or securities. * * * The written agreements herein indicate clearly that there was a cash consideration to Tex-Penn of $ We are not convinced by the oral evidence that that was not a fact. Accordingly, we hold that the petitioners have not brought themselves within section b) * * * and article * * * so as to escape recognition of gain.'
26
27
The opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, after discussion of primary or evidentiary facts found by the board, states, 'A consideration of all the documentary evidence drives us to the conclusion that the $was not consideration passing from Transcontinental to Tex-Penn, but was money furnished by the lessees as individuals to pay the debts of Tex-Penn so that the transaction might be made according to agreement. * * * In form the documents upon which the Board of Tax Appeals relied stated that the $was corporate consideration passing from Transcontinental, but in fact it was not, and the rule is well settled that in determining tax liability, taxing authorities must look through form to fact and substance. It has been a long time since these transactions took place, and most of the parties who were interested in them are dead; but every living person who was in any way connected with them testified without contradiction that the $was paid by the five lessees and not by Transcontinental.'
27
28
The validity of the ultimate finding above quoted is to be tested by what in fact was done rather than by the mere form of words used in the writings employed. United States v. Phellis, Curran v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) The Board's findings of circumstantial facts definitely show the substance of the transaction as actually consummated. Summarily stated, the details of controlling significance are these:

The remaining $was to pay Benedum and Parriott for their nine-sixteenths: $to Benedum for his six-sixteenths and $to Parriott for his three-sixteenths.

The Board's findings of evidentiary details not only fail to support, but definitely negative, its conclusion that the consideration received by Tex-Penn in exchange for its assets included $in cash.
38
39
Essential to the project was the transfer to Transcontinental of Tex-Penn assets free from claims and equally indispensable was the transfer of the individually owned lease interests. Tex-Penn needed money to satisfy demands of its creditors. Should it be unable to free its property from liability, the entire enterprise might fail. In that event, the individuals would lose the sale of their lease interests. And so, they decided to provide the cash needed by Tex-Penn to clear its assets and for that purpose they caused Transcontinental to advance Tex-Penn the $and deduct it from $ the price it was to pay them for their lease interests. The excess, $ was ratably distributed as shown above. No part of the $was included in or had any relation to the consideration for the transfer of the Tex-Penn assets. In legal effect, the details found by the Board to have been carried out are not to be distinguished from a direct advance by the five individuals to Tex-Penn of the money required to pay its debts. Unquestionably, such an advance would not constitute consideration received by Tex-Penn. As against the Board's findings showing what was actually done in consummation of the transaction, no weight as evidence can be given to mere recitals, directions, engagements, and admissions of respondents contained in the documents relied on by the Board. It should have held that the Transcontinental stock was the sole consideration for the transfer of the Tex-Penn assets. The Circuit Court of Appeals rightly held that the ruling to the contrary was erroneous.
39
 The Board's second ultimate finding is (: 'The cash received by Wrather, Lantz, and Kirkland from Transcontinental was consideration for both their stock in Tex-Penn and their interests in the Duke-Knoles leases.' The Board ( deemed that conclusion an additional ground for its ruling that the transaction is not within the nonrecognition provisions of section b). In support of that view the Commissioner maintains that 'the nominal sale of stock, the transfer of the assets of Tex-Penn, and the sale of the individual interests in the leases, constituted a single indivisible transaction.'
40
41
But the circumstantial facts clearly negative this ultimate finding. Kirkland, Lantz, and Wrather sold their Tex-Penn stock to Benedum and Parriott and their lease interests to Transcontinental. The stock was sold and delivered before the assignment of the lease interests was made. The transfer on the company's stock book was effected, and their connection as stockholders and directors was terminated, while the lease interests were being held until paid for by Transcontinental. The stipulation that, if payment for their lease interests was not made by August 1, the assignment of their shares of stock would be returned, did not make the two sales a single or indivisible transaction. Assuming that Kirkland, Lantz, and Wrather would not have sold their Tex-Penn stock without also selling their lease interests, that fact would not convert the two sales into one. The purpose of the stipulation is plain. If Transcontental did not pay for and take the lease interests and Tex-Penn continued to operate the properties, they would again become stockholders and have a voice in the operation.
41
42
On the point under consideration, the Commissioner's position before the Board is not in harmony with his contention here. There he made four computations: Two were of Tex-Penn taxes, the other two were respectively those of the other respondents. In all his calculations, he attributed to the consideration for Tex-Penn assets the shares of Transcontinental and to the Benedum and Parriott lease interests their shares of the cash, $ less the amount thereof used to pay Tex-Penn debts. All these shares went to Benedum and Parriott who owned all the Tex-Penn stock. The deficiencies claimed by the Commissioner and the amounts determined by the Board rest upon the fact that Benedum and Parriott as the only stockholders of Tex-Penn became the owners of the Transcontinental shares. And, as shown by the Board's findings, the balance of the cash without more went to Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather for their lease interests.
42
43
It is immaterial whether $30 was sufficient fully to compensate them for their Tex-Penn stock. The findings show the transfer was valid. Invalidating disparity between worth and consideration is not disclosed, and may not be assumed. Indeed, the Commissioner's brief states that Tex-Penn was organized to develop the leases which were the personal property of its five stockholders; it 'was not expected to operate at a profit * * * and actually it could not operate at a profit * * * It was useful chiefly in connection with the five-eighths royalties in the Duke-Knoles field held individually by its stockholders.' And respondents call attention to findings disclosing operating results that point in the same direction.
43
44
We find nothing in the circumstantial facts found or in the evidence to support the Board's conclusion that Kirkland, Lantz, and Wrather received from Transcontinental any cash for their stock in Tex-Penn. It cannot be sustained.
44
 The Commissioner seeks reversal upon the grounds that the transaction was not a tax-exempt reorganization because Tex-Penn sought to realize a profit rather than merely to change the form of its ownership and that section b) does not exempt from taxation exchanges of property for stock. Specifically he argues that, assuming that the Transcontinental stock was the sole property exchanged for Tex-Penn assets, the transaction was not within the nonrecognition of gains provision. Concededly, this contention is contrary to the interpretation put upon section b) by art. which was promulgated September 26, 1919 by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury and has since been followed.4 The parties presented their respective claims to the Board and to the lower court on the theory that, if neither Tex-Penn nor its stockholders as such received any cash from Transcontinental, the transaction would be within section b). The Commissioner's notices of deficiency do not suggest the construction for which he now contends. He sought no ruling upon the question from the Board or the lower court and is therefore not entitled to have it decided here. Helvering v. Minnesota Tea Co., The taxpayers were entitled to know the basis of law and fact on which the Commissioner sought to sustain the deficiencies. His failure earlier to present the question leaves this court without the assistance of decision below.5 His petitions for these writs did not present the question to this court. We are not called on to consider the construction of section b) now proposed.6
45
 As the sole consideration to Tex-Penn was Transcontinental shares and as Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather received from Transcontinental no cash for their Tex-Penn stock, the transaction is within the nonrecognition of gains provisions. The judgments must therefore be affirmed.
46
 The court is also of opinion that the judgments must be affirmed upon the ground that in the peculiar circumstances of this case, the shares of Transcontinental stock, regard being had to their highly speculative quality and to the terms of a restrictive agreement making a sale thereof impossible, did not have a fair market value, capable of being ascertained with reasonable certainty, when they were acquired by the taxpayers.
47
48
In the absence of such value, the ownership of the shares did not lay the basis for the computation of a gain at the time they were received, or for a tax as of that date under the applicable statute. Section b). Treasury Regulations .

THOMAS
v.
PERKINS et ux.
Argued May 4-5, 1937.
1
Respondents, husband and wife, sued in the District Court for Northern Texas to recover a portion of the tax they paid for on their community income. In respect of the amount now in controversy, that court gave judgment for defendant (; the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed ( and, its decision being in apparent conflict with that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in Comar Oil Co. v. Burnet, this court granted the collector's petition for a writ of certiorari. —-.

Hammonds and Branson owned oil and gas leases on undeveloped lands in Texas which provided for a royalty of one-eighth. They assigned to the Faith Oil Company which was principally owned by Green and Perkins. In taking the assignment, the company acted for itself to the extent of one-fourth and for Green and Perkins to the extent of three-eighths each. Later it transferred its interest to Perkins. So far as concerns the question here presented, Perkins may be treated as sole assignee of Hammonds and Branson. The assignment recites that they are owners of all rights under or incident to the leases and declares that 'in consideration of the sum of Ten Dollars ($* * * and of the further sum of Three Hundred Ninety Five Thousand Dollars ($ to be paid out of the oil produced and saved from the * * * lands, and to be one-fourth of all the oil produced and saved * * * until the full sum * * * is paid, we * * * do hereby bargain, sell, transfer, assign, and convey all our rights, title, and interest in and to said leases and rights thereunder.'
2
3
After description of the lands and leaseholds the assignment provides that the oil payment shall be made to the assignors, Hammonds and Branson, each to receive one-half thereof, 'out of the oil produced and saved from' the leased premises, 'which payments shall be made by the pipe line company or other purchaser of said oil, and shall be one-fourth (1/4) of all the oil produced and saved from the above described land, until the full sum * * * is fully paid.' It is understood and agreed that the $'is payable out of oil only, if, as and when produced from said lands above described, and said oil payment does not constitute and shall not be a personal obligation of the assignee, its successors or assigns. * * * The oil payment * * * shall bear none of the expenses of the development of said leases or any other burden.' The instrument does not purport to reserve a lien.

Perkins drilled wells on the leased lands and in 1933 produced oil; the assignors received substantial amounts, to apply on the payment to be made them; the oil was run from the wells into tanks on the leased premises from which it was taken by pipeline companies purchasing the oil. Each purchaser required and was furnished a division order executed by all the interested parties. By such orders assignors authorized purchasers to receive from the wells one-fourth of the oil and declared that the oil run should become the property of the purchasers as soon as received by them. In accordance with the orders, purchasers made payments directly and proportionately to the owner of the royalty reserved in the lease, to assignors, and to assignee. The last could not collect for any portion of the oil applicable to the oil payment to be made assignors.
4
5
In their tax return for respondents, Perkins and wife, did not include in income any part of the proceeds that went to assignors. But the Commissioner charged the amounts received by the assignors to the respondents and allowed the latter depletion in respect of the same. At the trial it was proved that the long-established practice of the bureau was not to require the operator of an oil and gas lease to include as a part of his income the royalties payable in kind to the lessors. But where they were payable in cash the operator included the proceeds of all the oil and took as an offsetting deduction the amount of royalties paid. It was admitted that, if the assignors' payments are excluded, the depletion allowed respondents should be correspondingly reduced.
5
6
The question is whether respondents' gross income should include moneys paid to assignors by purchasers of the oil.
6
7
We need not decide whether technical title to the oil while in the ground was in assignors, or in assignee. The federal income tax act is to be given a uniform construction of nation-wide application except in so far as Congress has made it dependent on state law.2 The granting clause in the assignment would be sufficient, if standing alone, to transfer all the oil to the assignee. It does not specifically except or exclude any part of the oil. But it is qualified by other parts of the instrument. The provisions for payment to assignors in oil only, the absence of any obligation of the assignee to pay in oil or in money, and the failure of assignors to take any security by way of lien or otherwise unmistakably show that they intended to withhold from the operation of the grant one-fourth of the oil to be produced and saved up to an amount sufficient when sold to yield $3
7
8
The construction that the parties put upon the assignment makes for the same conclusion. There is no suggestion that, having taken title, the assignee transferred any of the oil back to assignors. The division orders designated, and so served to indicate ownership of, the quantities belonging to each of the interested parties. And, in the circumstances, the orders given and proceeds received by assignors necessarily covered and were derived from oil not transferred by the assignment.
8
9
Our decision in Palmer v. Bender, supports the view that the assignment did not transfer the oil in question. We there construed section , Revenue Act of which directed a reasonable allowance for depletion in the case of oil and gas wells 'according to the peculiar conditions in each case' and 'that such depletion allowance based on discovery value shall not exceed the net income, computed without allowance for depletion, from the property upon which the discovery is made. * * * In the case of leases the deductions allowed * * * shall be equitably apportioned between the lessor and lessee.'
9
10
The taxpayer, Palmer, was a member of a partnership that acquired oil and gas leases, discovered oil, executed a writing conferring on a company the right to take over a part of the leased property in consideration of a present payment of a cash bonus, and future payments to be made 'out of one-half of the first oil produced and saved' to the extent of $ and an additional 'excess royalty' of one-eighth of all the oil produced and saved. The writing declared that the partnership 'does sell, assign, set over, transfer and deliver * * * unto the' oil company the described leased premises.
10
11
In his tax return, Palmer reported his share of the income derived by the partnership from the bonus payment and oil received under its contract with the oil company and, relying on section , made a deduction for depletion based on value of oil in place on the date of discovery. The Commissioner refused to allow the deduction on the theory that the transaction was a sale of the leases by the partnership, and that the only allowable deduction was one based upon the cost of the property. As cost was less than the discovery value, the Commissioner's allowance of depletion was less than that claimed by Palmer and the tax was correspondingly greater. He paid it, and sued the collector to recover the amount by which the Commissioner's ruling operated to increase his burden.
11
12
The District Court upheld the Commissioner's ruling, the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, this court reversed. We said ( at pages : 'The language of the statute is broad enough to provide, at least, for every case in which the taxpayer has acquired, by investment, any interest in the oil in place, and secures, by any form of legal relationship, income derived from the extraction of the oil, to which he must look for a return of his capital. * * * Similarly, the lessor's right to a depletion allowance does not depend upon his retention of ownership or any other particular form of legal interest in the mineral content of the land. It is enough if by virtue of the leasing transaction he has retained a right to share in the oil produced. If so, he has an economic interest in the oil, in place, which is depleted by production. Thus we have recently held that the lessor is entitled to a depletion allowance on bonus and royalties, although by the local law ownership of the minerals, in place passed from the lessor upon the execution of the lease. * * * Thus throughout their changing relationships with respect to the properties, the oil in the ground was a reservoir of capital investment of the several parties, all of whom * * * were entitled to share in the oil produced.'
12
13
Thus in that case we held assignors' mere stipulation for royalty out of oil operated to save to them an economic interest in the oil sufficient to entitle them to deduct from their income derived from the oil an allowance for depletion. If Palmer had retained no interest in the oil, he would have been entitled to no deduction on account of depletion. Ownership was essential. The assignee was not entitled to income from Palmer's share of the oil nor to deduct from the income it received from its own interest any part of the depletion allowance that was attributable to Palmer's interest.
13
14
Helvering v. Twin Bell Syndicate, construed depletion provisions in the Revenue Act of which so far as concerns ownership are not to be distinguished from corresponding provisions considered in Palmer v. Bender, supra. Section declared that in the case of oil and gas wells 'the allowance for depletion shall be per centum of the gross income from the property during the taxable year.' Section required the deductions allowed to be equitably apportioned between the lessor and lessee. The taxpayer, assignee of the lease, extracted substantial quantities of oil. By the terms of the lease and assignment he was obligated to pay royalties in cash or kind totaling one-fourth of the oil. He claimed that gross proceeds of all the oil should form the basis for computation of the allowance for depletion. The Commissioner ruled that the deduction should be limited to per cent. of the gross production less royalties. The Board of Tax Appeals upheld that ruling; the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the board; we sustained the Commissioner. Our opinion shows that the phrase, 'income from the property,' means income from oil and gas only; that, where the lessee turns over royalty oil in kind to the lessor, the amount retained by lessee is the basis for his computation of depletion and the royalty oil is the basis for that allowable to lessor. In that connection we suggested that Congress did not intend a different result where the lessee sells all the oil and pays over the royalty in the form of cash. And in approval of the Commissioner's ruling we said ( at page : 'The apportionment gives respondent per cent. of the gross income from production which it had the right to retain and the assignor and lessor respectively per cent. of the royalties they receive. Such an apportionment has regard to the economic interest of each of the parties entitled to participate in the depletion allowance. Compare Palmer v. Bender, '
14
15
As in the earlier of these cases the assignor was entitled to deduct depletion from income he received from his interest in the oil, so in the later one the assignee was not entitled to deduct from income received from its share an allowance for depletion attributable to the assignor's interest. The owner of an interest in the deposit is entitled to deduct for depletion of the part producing his income but may not deduct for depletion of a share belonging to another.
15
16
As Hammonds and Branson, the assignors in this case, would be entitled to an allowance for depletion in respect of the oil sold out of their share,4 the income from that interest is not chargeable to respondents, Perkins and wife. It follows that the Commissioner erred in including in their income the payments made by purchasers to assignors for their share of the oil.
16
17
Affirmed.
17
18
Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO think the oil and gas produced by the assignee of the lease, and their proceeds, were his income and not any the less so because he agreed to apply a part to payment of the purchase price of the lease, and gave an equitable lien to secure the payment. Whether the purchase price, when paid, represented a capital gain taxable to the assignors, and whether in that case their interest would be subject to a depletion allowance under our decision in Palmer v. Bender, are questions irrelevant to the present issue. The judgment should be reversed.
