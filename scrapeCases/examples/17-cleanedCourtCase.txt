90 U.S. 119
LEWIS
v.
HAWKINS ET AL.
October Term, 1874
1
Upon the execution of the notes and the title-bond between Lewis and Hawkins, Lewis held the legal title as trustee for Hawkins; and Hawkins was a trustee for Lewis as to the purchase-money. Hawkins was cestui que trust as to the former and Lewis as to the latter.7 The seller under such circumstances has a vendor's lien, which is certainly not impaired by withholding the conveyance. The equitable estate of the vendee is alienable, descendible, and devisable in like manner as real estate held by a legal title. The securities for the purchase-money are personalty, and in the event of the death of the vendor, go to his personal representative.8 It does not appear that the title-bond authorized Hawkins to take possession, or that he did so. If there were no such authority, and he entered into possession, he held as a licensee or tenant at will.9 The vendee cannot in such cases dispute the title of his vendor any more than the lessee can dispute that of his lessor.10 Any other person coming into possession under the vendee, either with his consent or as an intruder, is bound by a like estoppel.11 Hamiter, having bought and assumed the payment of the purchase-money stipulated to be paid by Hawkins, took the property subject to the same liabilities, legal and equitable, to which it was subject in the hands of Hawkins.12
1
2
The discharge in bankruptcy released Hawkins from personal liability for his debt, but the statute of limitations cannot avail to protect the land from the vendor's lien upon it, for the purchase-money which Hawkins agreed to pay, and which Hamiter, when he bought the land, assumed and agreed to pay for him.
2
3
We have already shown that as between Lewis and Hawkins there was a trust which embraced the purchase-money and fastened itself upon the land. The debt did not affect his assignee personally, but as we have shown also it continued to bind the land in all respects as if the transfer had not been made. The trust was an express one. Its terms and purposes were evinced by the title-bond, and the promissory notes to which that instrument referred. 'As between trustee and cestui que trust, in the case of an express trust, the statute of limitation has no application, and no length of time is a bar. Accounts have been decreed against trustees extending over periods of thirty, forty, and even fifty years. The relations and privity between trustee and cestui que trust are such that the possession of one is the possession of the other, and there can be no adverse possession during the continuance of the relation. . A cestui que trust cannot set up the statute against his co-cestui que trust, nor against his trustee. These rules apply in all cases of express trusts.'13
3
4
'As between trustees and cestui que trust, an express trust, constituted by the act of the parties themselves, will not be barred by any length of time, for in such cases there is no adverse possession, the possession of the trustee being the possession of the cestui que trust.'14
4
5
The same principle applies where the cestui que trust is in possession. He is regarded as a tenant at will to the trustee. 'Therefore, until this tenancy is determined there can be no adverse possession between the parties.'15 The relation once established is presumed to continue, unless a distinct denial, or acts, or a possession inconsistent with it are clearly shown.16
5
6
In many of the cases it is held that the lien of the vendor under the circumstances of this case is substantially a mortgage.17 It is well settled that the possession of the mortgagor is not adverse to that of the mortgagee. In the case last cited it is said that to apply the statute of limitations 'would be like making the lapse of time the origin of title in the tenant against his landlord.' That the remedy upon the bond, note, or simple contract for the purchase-money is barred in cases like this, in no wise affects the right to proceed in equity against the land. As in respect to mortgages, the lien will be presumed to have been satisfied after the lapse of twenty years from the maturity of the debt, but in both cases laches may be explained and the presumption repelled.18 The principles upon which this opinion proceeds are distinctly recognized in Harris v. King.19 That case alone would be decisive of the case before us. The considerations which apply where the vendor in such cases resorts to an action of ejectment were examined by this court in Burnett v. Caldwell.20
6
7
The bill avers the tender of a deed by the complainant to Hawkins before the bill was filed. The answer of Hawkins denies the allegation. The testimony of Lewis sustains the bill; that of Hawkins the answer. The averment is not established. Except as to the costs the point is of no significance. If the tender of a deed had been properly made, and there had been no unjustifiable resistance to the taking of the decree by the complainant, to which he is entitled, he would have been required to pay all the costs. There being a contest, and it appearing that a tender would have been without effect, the costs must abide the result of the litigation.21
7
8
There is manifest error in the decree, but the bill is defective in not making the heirs-at-law of Hamiter parties, unless there is some statutory provision of the State of Arkansas which obviates this objection.
8
9
If necessary the bill can be amended in the court below.

FASHNACHT
v.
FRANK.
October Term, 1874
1
Previous to the time when the motion for a new trial was made and overruled, no question had been presented in the cause that could under any circumstances give this court jurisdiction upon a writ of error. On the 23d of January a petition was filed by the defendant for the removal of the cause to the Circuit Court of the United States. This petition was at once very properly overruled, for the reason that a final judgment had already been rendered. No exception was taken to this ruling. So far as appears the defendant was satisfied, as he should have been, that he could not have relief in that form against the judgment which had been rendered. On the 31st of January an appeal from the judgment was taken to the Supreme Court of the State. This was clearly the appropriate remedy for the correction of the errors of the District Court, if there were any. The action of the District Court in refusing the removal does not appear to have been presented to the Supreme Court upon this appeal. It could not properly have been presented, because the appeal was from the judgment alone, and this action was subsequent to the judgment and independent of it. We act only upon the judgment of the Supreme Court. Only such questions as either have been or ought to have been passed upon by that court in the regular course of its proceedings can be considered by us upon error.

EX PARTE SAWYER.
October Term, 1874
1
By the mandate already issued in the case, we have required the Circuit Court to proceed with the execution of its decree in such manner as right and justice shall require. If the court refuses to proceed under that order we may, by mandamus, compel it to do so, but we have no power to control its discretion while proceeding. A superior court may by mandamus set the machinery of an inferior court in motion, but when that has been done its power under that form of proceeding is at an end. The inferior court is supreme within its own jurisdiction so long as it is acting.
1
2
The question then is as to the power of the Circuit Court under the mandate from this court to determine whether execution should or should not issue against the sureties in the stipulation.
2
3
It is not denied that the liability of the principal respondents was fixed by the decree of the Circuit Court. The appeal took away from that court all power over that part of the decree. Upon the affirmance in this court that liability was conclusively settled, and the mandate left nothing for the Circuit Court but to proceed in the appropriate manner for the collection of the money found due.
3
4
But the sureties occupy a different position. No decree was entered against them before the appeal. The order was that a judgment be entered if an appeal was not taken. The appeal was taken, and, therefore, this order never became operative. The case then stood in the Circuit Court upon the return of the mandate without a decree against the sureties, and until such decree was entered there could be no execution as to them. It is true that if the appeal had not been taken the requisite decree might have been obtained, but it is equally true that until a decree is actually entered the court retains the power to withhold it.
4
5
At the time of the appeal, therefore, the Circuit Court might have refused to order the execution against the sureties. The decree of this court simply affirmed what had been done by the Circuit Court; it gave no instructions as to what remained to be done, except that it should be as right and justice and the laws of the United States should require. The Circuit Court was left free to determine for itself what was thus required. If, in its opinion, the order in respect to the judgment and execution against the sureties should be carried into effect, it might so adjudge, but if, upon further consideration, right and justice should seem to require a revocation of that order, there was nothing in the mandate to prevent it from so deciding.
5
6
Some action by the court was certainly necessary before the execution could issue against the sureties. Such seems to have been the understanding of the libellants, for upon the filing of the mandate they moved for the entry of a decree against these parties and the award of an execution thereon. There could have been no necessity for a motion if the court was not to hear and decide upon the propriety of the action moved for. The power to act upon a motion and determine whether it should be granted necessarily implies the power to refuse to grant it. The Circuit Court, under this power, has acted and has decided that execution ought not to issue against these parties. This decision cannot be reviewed by us upon an application for mandamus. Error or appeal furnishes the only remedy in such a case.
6
7
There is still another view of the case which shows the correctness of this conclusion. The sureties upon the stipulation are entitled to an appeal from any decree that may be rendered against them. A decree against the principal respondents does not necessarily include them. Additional proof is required before they can be charged. Here the decree was absolute against the principal respondents alone. The order against the sureties was provisional only. They could not appeal from that because it was not final. It is clear, therefore, that the power of the court over that part of the case was not at an end when the appeal was taken, and that if the sureties were to be charged at all it must be by a decree to be entered after the cause was sent back from here. From that decree another appeal must be allowed, or the sureties will be bound by a proceeding to which they were not and could not be parties.
7
8
This renders it unnecessary to consider any of the other questions presented in the argument. As it was within the power of the Circuit Court under the mandate from this court to decide whether execution should issue against the sureties, we cannot revise its decision in this form of proceeding.

9
PETITION DISMISSED.

ATLEE
v.
PACKET COMPANY.
October Term, 1874
1
No question is made of the jurisdiction of the District Court sitting in admiralty.
1
2
The testimony is very voluminous, as is also the discussion of it by counsel, but we are of opinion that the decision of the case must rest mainly on undisputed facts, or those about which there is but little conflict of testimony.
2
3
We shall assume the truth of the facts which we state as the foundation of our judgment, without a reference to the witnesses by which they are proved.
3
4
The pier against which libellant's barge struck is about thirty feet square, constructed of stone and timber, located from one hundred and forty to fifty feet from the bank of the river, in water of the average depth of twelve feet at that place, being ten feet even at a low stage of the water.
4
5
At low water this pillar is fifteen feet above the surface, and a foot or two in very high water. A part of the distance between the shore and the pier consists in low water of a sand-bar. Seven hundred feet above the pier this sand-bar tends to a point in the river made by the deposits from a small stream called French Creek, and this point, in relation to the general course of the river, projects something further towards the centre of the channel than Atlee's pier does.
5
6
Three-quarters of a mile above the pier is the levee, wharf, or landing-place of the city of Fort Madison.
6
7
The appellant was the owner of extensive saw-mills, and of the lands on which they were located, bounded by the river at the point of the location of the pier for some distance above and below. He had built this pier, and another below it, as parts of a boom for receiving and retaining the logs necessary for use in his mill. Some kind of a boom was necessary to enable him to keep these logs safely and economically. No question is made but that if he had a right to build a pier at that place it was built with due skill and care, and that he was blameless in every other respect, unless the absence of a light at night was a fault.
7
8
The first question, then, to be decided is whether, in view of these facts, appellant could lawfully build such a pier at the precise spot where this was located.
8
9
The affirmative of this proposition was held by the learned judge of the District Court, on the general ground of the analogy which the present case bears to wharves, levees, piers, and other landing-places on navigable rivers, which are built and owned by individuals, and which are projected into the navigable channel of the river farther than defendant's pier. The cases of Yates v. Milwaukee,1 Dutton v. Strong,2 and The Railroad Company v. Schurmeir,3 are cited in support of the proposition. Bridges, also, across these rivers, with piers, which clearly render navigation more hazardous, and which have by this court been held to be lawful structures, are cited in aid of this view.4
9
10
What is the precise extent to which, in cities and towns, these structures, owned by individuals, or by the town or city corporations, may be permitted to occupy a portion of what had been navigable water, and under what circumstances this may be done, it is not our present purpose to decide, nor to lay down any invariable rule on the subject. It is sufficient to say that we do not consider the case before us as falling within the principles on which that class of cases has been decided.
10
11
In all incorporated towns or cities located on navigable waters, there is in their charters, or in some general statute of the State, either express or implied power for the establishment and regulation of these landings.
11
12
This may be done by the legislature of the State or by authority expressly or impliedly delegated to the local municipal government. In all such cases there is exercised a control over the location, erection, and use of such wharves or landings, which will prevent their being made obstructions to navigation and standing menaces of danger.
12
13
The wharves or piers are generally located by lines bearing such relation to the shore and to the navigable water as to present no danger to vessels using the river, and the control which the State exercises over them is such as to secure at once their usefulness and their safety.
13
14
These structures are also allowable in a part of the water which can be used for navigation, on the ground that they are essential aids to navigation itself.
14
15
The navigable streams of the country would be of little value for that purpose if they had no places where the vessels which they floated could land, with conveniences for receiving and discharging cargo, for laying by safely until this is done, and then departing with ease and security in the further prosecution of their voyage. Wharves and piers are as necessary almost to the successful use of the stream in navigation as the vessels themselves, and are to be considered as an important part of the instrumentalities of this branch of commerce. But to be of any value in this respect they must reach so far into deep water as to enable the vessels used in ordinary navigation to float while they touch them and are lashed to their sides. They must of necessity occupy a part of the stream over which a vessel could float if they were not there.
15
16
The structure of Mr. Atlee is sustained by none of these considerations. It is built far away from a city or town, and might as well be ten miles off as where it is, for any relation it has to the business or commerce of the city of Fort Madison, or any subjection to the control of the city authorities. His right to build this structure in the navigable channel of the river is unsupported by any statute of the State, general or specific, by any ordinance of a city or town, or by any license from any authority whatever.
16
17
Nor is there any claim or pretence that this pier is in aid of navigation. No vessel or water-craft is expected to land there, nor are there any arrangements by which they can land or be secured or fastened. The size of the pier, its sharp corners, its elevation from the water, and its want of connection with the shore, forbid any such use of it. It is intended to receive nothing that floats but rafts, and no rafts but such as its owner designs to keep there permanently for his own use.
17
18
He rests his defence solely on the ground that at any place where a riparian owner can make such a structure useful to his personal pursuits or business, he can, without license or special authority, and by virtue of this ownership, and of his own convenience, project a pier or roadway into the deep water of a navigable stream, provided he does it with care, and leaves a large and sufficient passway of the channel unobstructed.
18
19
No case known to us has sustained this proposition, and we think its bare statement sufficient to show its unsoundness.
19
20
It is true that bridges, especially railroad bridges, exist across the Mississippi and other navigable streams, which present more dangerous impediments to navigation than this pier of Mr. Atlee's, and that they have, so far as they have been subjected to judicial consideration, been upheld. But this has never been upon the ground of the absolute right of the owners of the land on which they abutted to build such structures. The builders have in every instance recognized the necessity of legislative permission by express statute of the State, or of the United States, before they ventured on such a proceeding. And the only question that has ever been raised in this class of cases is, whether a State could authorize such an invasion of the rights of persons engaged in navigating these streams. This court has decided that in the absence of any legislation of Congress on the subject, the State may authorize bridges across navigable streams by statutes so well guarded as to protect the substantial rights of navigation.5 But Mr. Atlee has no such authority, and pretends to none.
20
21
We are of opinion that the pier against which libellant's barge struck was placed by him in the navigable water of the Mississippi River, without authority of law, and that he is responsible for the damages to the barge and its contents.
21
22
But the plaintiff has elected to bring his suit in an admiralty court, which has jurisdiction of the case, notwithstanding the concurrent right to sue at law. In this court the course of proceeding is in many respects different and the rules of decision are different. The mode of pleading is different, the proceeding more summary and informal, and neither party has a right to trial by jury. An important difference as regards this case is the rule for estimating the damages.
22
23
In the common-law court the defendant must pay all the damages or none. If there has been on the part of plaintiffs such carelessness or want of skill as the common law would esteem to be contributory negligence, they can recover nothing. By the rule of the admiralty court, where there has been such contributory negligence, or in other words, when both have been in fault, the entire damages resulting from the collision must be equally divided between the parties. This rule of the admiralty commends itself quite as favorably in its influence in securing practical justice as the other, and the plaintiff who has the selection of the forum in which he will litigate, cannot complain of the rule of that forum.
23
24
It is not intended to say that the principles which determine the existence of mutual fault on which the damages are divided in admiralty, are precisely the same as those which establish contributory negligence at law that would defeat the action. Each court has its own set of rules for determining these questions, which may be in some respects the same, but in others vary materially.
24
25
The district judge was of opinion in this case that the libellant was in fault so as to require the application of the admiralty rule, and on that point this court agrees with him.
25
26
The character of the skill and knowledge required of a pilot in charge of a vessel on the rivers of the country is very different from that which enables a navigator to carry his vessel safely on the ocean. In this latter case a knowledge of the rules of navigation, with charts which disclose the places of hidden rocks, dangerous shores, or other dangers of the way, are the main elements of his knowledge and skill, guided as he is in his course by the compass, by the reckoning, and the observations of the heavenly bodies, obtained by the use of proper instruments. It is by these he determines his locality and is made aware of the dangers of such locality if any exist. But the pilot of a river steamer, like the harbor pilot, is selected for his personal knowledge of the topography through which he steers his vessel. In the long course of a thousand miles in one of these rivers, he must be familiar with the appearance of the shore on each side of the river as he goes along. Its banks, towns, its landings, its houses and trees, and its openings between trees, are all landmarks by which he steers his vessel. The compass is of little use to him. He must know where the navigable channel is, in its relation to all these external objects, especially in the night. He must also be familiar with all dangers that are permanently located in the course of the river, as sand-bars, snags, sunken rocks or trees, or abandoned vessels or barges. All this he must know and remember and avoid. To do this he must be constantly informed of changes in the current of the river, of sand-bars newly made, of logs or snags, or other objects newly presented, against which his vessel might be injured. In the active life and changes made by the hand of man or the action of the elements in the path of his vessel, a year's absence from the scene impairs his capacity, his skilled knowledge, very seriously in the course of a long voyage. He should make a few of the first 'trips,' as they are called, after his return, in company with other pilots more recently familiar with the river.
26
27
It may be said that this is exacting a very high order of ability in a pilot. But when we consider the value of the lives and property committed to their control, for in this they are absolute masters, the high compensation they receive, and the care which Congress has taken to secure by rigid and frequent examinations and renewal of licenses, this very class of skill, we do not think we fix the standard too high.
27
28
Any pilot who, during the navigable season of the year was engaged in conveying vessels up and down the Mississippi River past Fort Madison, would have known of the existence of this pier and would have avoided it. Though the pilot in this case had been many years engaged in navigating this part of the river, he had been absent for over a year, and this was his first voyage in a period of about fifteen months. He, therefore, did not know of the existence of this pier, and ran against it.
28
29
Again, the natural current of the river, after striking the little projection of the sand-bar below Fort Madison, is towards the eastern shore, and away from the shore with which this pier is connected. There was a large expanse of deep water a hundred feet further out than where the vessel ran which was safe, while there must always have been felt to be more or less danger of striking the saw-logs or boom, or some other matter belonging to Atlee's mill, by hugging the shore at that point even before the pier was built. A careful and prudent pilot in a dark night as this was would, therefore, have taken the middle of the river, the course of its natural current, instead of tending inward towards the shore after passing the projecting point of the sand-bar. For these reasons we are of opinion that there was such want of knowledge and skill in the pilot, and such want of care in his management of his vessel at that point, as to require the damages to be divided.
29
30
As there is no exception to the report of the commissioner of the District Courtto whom the question of damages was referred based on this view, the decree of the Circuit Court is REVERSED, with instructions to render a decree on the basis of that report for HALF THE DAMAGES which he found the libellant to have suffered.

89 U.S. 32
INSURANCE COMPANY
v.
NEWTON.
October Term, 1874
1
The court below allowed the statement of the company and its agent to the witness as to the sufficiency of the proofs of death of the insured to be received as conclusive of that fact, but by its charge to the jury in effect separated the admission of that fact from its accompanying language, that the proofs disclosed a case of suicide, and held that this latter statement was of an independent fact to be established by the company. In this particular we think the court erred. Every admission is to be taken as an entirety of the fact which makes for the one side, with the qualifications which limit, modify, or destroy its effect on the other side. This is a settled principle which has passed by its universality into an axiom of the law. Here the admission related to the two particulars which the proofs established, the death of the insured and the manner of his death, both of which facts appear by the same documents. They showed the death of the insured only as they showed that he had committed suicide, and all that the officers of the company evidently intended by their declaration was that they were satisfied with the proofs of the one fact because they established the other. The whole admission should, therefore, have been taken together. If it was sufficient to establish the death of the insured, it was also sufficient to show that the death was occasioned in such a manner as to relieve the company from responsibility.
1
2
But the court also erred in excluding from the jury the proofs presented of the death of the insured when offered by the company. When the plaintiff was permitted to show what the agent and officers of the company admitted the proofs established, it was competent for the company to produce the proofs thus referred to and use them as better evidence of what they did establish.
2
3
But independently of this position the proofs presented were admissible as representations on the part of the party for whose benefit the policies were taken, as to the death and the manner of the death of the insured. They were presented to the company in compliance with the condition of the policy requiring notice and proof of the death of the insured as preliminary to the payment of the insurancemoney. They were intended for the action of the company, and upon their truth the company had a right to rely. Unless corrected for mistake, the insured was bound by them. Good faith and fair dealing required that she should be held to representations deliberately made until it was shown that they were made under a misapprehension of the facts, or in ignorance of material matters subsequently ascertained.
3
4
There are many cases which hold that where a mistake has occurred in the preliminary proofs presented, and no corrected statement is furnished the insurers before trial, the insured will not be allowed on the trial to show that the facts were different from those stated. The case of Campbell v. The Charter Oak Insurance Company, decided by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts,6 and the case of Irving v. The Excelsior Insurance Company, decided by the Superior Court of the City of New York,7 are both to this effect. It is not necessary, however, to maintain any doctrine as strict as this in the present case; and possibly the rule there laid down is properly applicable only where the insurers have been prejudiced in their defence by relying upon the statements contained in the proofs. Be that as it may, all that we now hold is that the preliminary proofs are admissible as prim a facie evidence of the facts stated therein against the insured and on behalf of the company. No case has come under our observation, other than the present, where the preliminary proofs presented by the insured have been entirely excluded as evidence when offered by the insurers, the question being in all the cases whether these proofs estopped the insured from impeaching the correctness of their statements, or from qualifying them, or whether they were subject to be explained and varied or contradicted on the trial.
4
5
The case of Cluff v. The Mutual Benefit Insurance Company, in the Supreme Court of Massachusetts,8 cited by the plaintiff, is far from sustaining his position. There the beneficiary had submitted in connection with the preliminary proof certain slips cut from newspapers showing reports that the insured had died in known violation of law. On the trial upon the issue whether the plaintiff had, ninety days previous to the commencement of the suit, furnished the company sufficient proof of the death of the insured, the plaintiff put in evidence certain affidavits by which that proof had been made, but did not offer the slips; the latter were then offered by the company and were excluded, and the Supreme Court, in reviewing the case, held that the exclusion was not a valid ground of exception unless it plainly appeared that the insurers were prejudiced thereby, and that they were not so prejudiced because the fact of death was otherwise sufficiently shown. 'When an apparent ground of defence,' said the court, 'is disclosed by a separate and unnecessary narration of circumstances, and the proofs required by the policy are complete without that narration and disclosure, it cannot be said that the party has failed to comply with the conditions imposed upon his right to litigate his claim; and the effect of such disclosure to defeat the action must depend upon the degree to which the plaintiff is bound by the statement. If not sworn to by the plaintiff, nor treated by him in such manner that he is concluded by his conduct, the whole question will be open to explanation and proof upon the main issue subject to the usual rules of evidence.'
5
6
In the present case the proofs presented were sworn to; they consisted, as already stated, of affidavits and the record of the finding of a jury under oath. Here the narration of the manner of the death of the deceased was so interwoven with the statement of his death that the two things were inseparable. The fact that the proofs were presented by the father of the plaintiff and not by the plaintiff herself cannot change their character. They were the only proofs presented, and without them there was no attempted compliance with the condition of the policies. He was the agent of the plaintiff with respect to the policies, intrusted by her with the presentation of the preliminary proofs. Presented in her name and by her agent in the matter, and constituting the essential preliminary to her action, they must stand as her acts, and the representations made therein must be taken as true until at least some mistake is shown to have occurred in them. As already said, no suggestion is made that these proofs do not truly state the manner of the death of the insured. It is sought, however, to avoid their effect in favor of the company by taking a part of the statement of its officers as to what the proofs showed, and rejecting the residue, and then excluding the proofs themselves. This position cannot be sustained without manifest injustice to the company.

FRENCH
v.
HAY.
October Term, 1874
1
It is plain that no other equity is asserted in the bill of the complainant than such as grew out of the alleged assignment and power of attorney of August There is none arising out of payments made by the complainant in the purchase of the debts and judgments. So far as it is charged by the bill, every dollar that was paid for the judgments was paid with the defendant's money, advanced by him to the complainant for the purchase. It is true the allegation is made that all the money over and above the $advanced, that was paid in the purchase of the debts, was furnished by the complainant out of his own resources but it is not averred that any more than $in all were paid. It is, therefore, the alleged assignment of August alone which is the basis of the complainant's equity.
1
2
That instrument, however, called an assignment, was, at most, but an executory agreement to assign. Construed with the power of attorney made at the same time, it admits of no other construction. The instrument was signed by Hay alone. French, the complainant, did not sign it, and it is not averred that he promised to pay the $ Hay undertook only that French should hold the judgments and claims 'upon his payment' of the stipulated consideration, with interest from the date. And the power of attorney given by Hay to French at the same time was an authority to deal with the securities in the name of Hay, and for Hay. The power was worse than useless, if the intention of the parties was that a present ownership of the judgment should be vested in French, without the payment of the agreed price. The utmost effect, therefore, that can be given to these two instruments of August upon which alone the complainant must rely, is that they amounted to an offer that if French would pay the $he should be the owner of the judgments. The transmission of the title and the payment of the price were intended to be contemporaneous. If this is so, how long was the defendant under obligation to hold the offer extended? No time for its acceptance was mentioned. The offer was made in August, 1860. The complainant never accepted it. No acceptance is averred in his bill. He never paid or tendered the $ he never assumed to pay it. He asserted no claim to the judgments until when he filed this bill. Now, while it is true that in equity time is generally not considered as of the essence of a contract, it is only true when compensation can be made for its lapse, and the rule is inapplicable in case of an offer that requires acceptance to make a contract. In May, 1861, the complainant having given no indication of acceptance, and having, so far as it appears, asserted no claim to the judgments, abandoned his home, and did not return until Not until three years after his return did he commence this action. Was the defendant under obligation to remain inactive and make no efforts to obtain the debts due him, uncertain whether French would ever elect to pay the $and take the judgments? We think not. Nothing in the instruments of August, 1860, imposed such an obligation. To say the least, therefore, it may well be doubted whether the complainant has any right under those instruments that a court of equity will enforce.
2
3
And were it conceded that, by the instrument through which he claims, French became the owner of the judgment, as between himself and Hay, we do not perceive how the concession could aid him in this case. If, as the bill avers, Hay collected the judgments and now holds the money for the use of the complainant, there is a complete remedy at law. This is not a bill for discovery, and the aid of a court of equity is not needed.
3
4
But the judgments never were collected. It is not pretended that the judgment debtors ever paid anything, or that French of Lenox, who were sureties for the payment of the debts, ever paid anything. In the railroad and property of the railroad company was sold under a deed of trust which the company had given prior to any of the judgments, and Hay became the purchaser. He paid none of the purchase-money with the judgments he held. He could not have paid with those judgments, for his bid was less than the sum due under the deed of trust, and that sum was prior in right to any of the judgments. Nor is there any attempt to prove that any part of the purchase-money was paid by the judgments. The evidence shows that after Hay purchased, a new company was formed; that a portion of its stock was allotted to him; that he subsequently sold the stock so allotted for a sum greater in amount than the aggregate of the judgments he held against the old company, and that after the formation of the new company, he caused satisfaction of the judgments to be entered of record. In no other manner than this is it now pretended that the judgments have been collected. The presumption of collection that might arise from the entries of satisfaction, if unexplained, is rebutted by the proof that all the defendant received was the proceeds of sale of his stock in the new company, by no possibility the fruit of the judgments. And the complainant cannot claim an interest in that stock or its proceeds, without affirming the trustees' sale of the railroad, and the subsequent formation of the new company, followed by the issue of the stock. Such a sale, if valid, would have destroyed the old company, three-quarters of the stock of which the complainant owned. But the sale has been judicially determined to have been invalid, the old company has recovered the property, and the new has been consequently adjudged never to have had a legal existence. The consequence of this is that the complainant now holds his full interest in the old company, unimpaired by any sale. After this it is impossible to see how he can assert that any part of the new stock or its proceeds belonged to him; and if it did not, nothing has been collected for him, even if he can be considered the owner of the judgments. Nor has he been injured by the entries of satisfaction, for if he became the owner of the judgments by force of the instruments of August as he avers, he is the owner still, notwithstanding the entries of satisfaction, for no one but the owner could cause valid acknowledgments of satisfaction to be made. For these reasons the decree must be

89 U.S. 381
MORGAN
v.
CAMPBELL, ASSIGNEE.
October Term, 1874
1
APPEAL from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of Illinois.
1
2
This was a contest between a landlord of demised premises claiming rent, and the assignee in bankruptcy of his tenants, claiming certain personal property on the premises, out of which the landlord by distress expected to get his rent.
2
3
The case, which depended more or less upon statute law of Illinois, in force at the time of the landlord's levy, was thus:
3
4
A statute of Illinois known as its Landlord and Tenant Act,1 enacts as follows, in certain sections its enactments bearing on the subject of rent, distress, &c.:
4
5
'SECTION 6. In all cases of distress for rent, the person making the same shall immediately file with some justice of the peace, in case the amount claimed does not exceed $ or with the clerk of the Circuit Court in case it exceeds that sum, a copy of the distress warrant, together with an inventory of the property levied upon; and thereupon the party against whom the distress warrant shall have been issued shall be duly summoned, and the amount due from him assessed and entered upon the records of the court finding the same. The said court shall certify to the person or officer making the same the amount so found due, together with the costs of court, and said officer shall thereupon proceed to sell the property so distrained and make the amount thus certified to him, and return the certificate so issued to him with an indorsement thereon of his proceedings, which return and certificate shall be filed in the proper court.
5
6
'SECTION 7. In all cases of distress for rent it shall be lawful for the landlord, by himself, his agent, or attorney, to seize for rent any personal property of his tenant that may be found in the county where such tenant shall reside, and in no case shall the property of any other person, although the same may be found on the premises, be liable to seizure for rent due from such tenant.
6
7
'SECTION 8. Every landlord shall have a lien upon the crops, growing or grown upon the demised premises in any year, for rent that shall accrue for such year.
7
8
'SECTION 9. In case of the removal or abandonment of the premises by such tenant, all grain or vegetables grown or growing upon any part of the demised premises so abandoned may be seized by the landlord, before the rent is due, and the landlord so distraining shall cause the grain or vegetables so growing to be properly cultivated and perfected, and in all cases husband such grain or vegetables, grown or growing, until the rent agreed upon shall become due, when it shall be lawful for such landlord to sell and dispose of the same as in other cases of seizure, after the rent shall have become due,' &c.
8
9
These enactments being in force, one Morgan, on the 18th of June, 1872, leased to Liebenstein & Spiegel certain premises in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, at a rent of $per month, payable September and on the last day of every month thereafter. The lease provided that if default should be made in the payment of the rent, when due, Morgan might distrain upon any property belonging to lessees, whether exempt from execution and distress by law or not, and the lessees waived all right to hold or retain any such property under any exemption laws then in force in the State of Illinois, or in any other way; 'meaning and intending hereby,' said the lease, 'to give the said party of the first part, his heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns a valid and first lien, upon any and all goods and chattels, and other property belonging to the said party of the second part, as security for the payment of said rent in manner aforesaid, anything hereinbefore contained to the contrary notwithstanding.'
9
10
Liebenstein & Spiegel entered into possession of the premises, but paid only one month's rent.
10
11
On the 14th of May, 1873, a petition was filed in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, by one Harrington, charging Liebenstein & Spiegel with having committed acts of bankruptcy, and praying that they might be declared bankrupts.
11
12
Three days afterwards, that is to say on the 17th of May, between seven and eight months' rent ($ being now dueMorgan, the landlord, issued his warrant to the sheriff of Cook County for distraining the goods and chattels of his tenants, then on the premises, to pay the rent due; and on the same day the sheriff did levy the warrant upon them, and held them under the warrant, on the premises. On the 16th of June, 1873, he filed in the proper court an inventory of them, and caused a summons in the matter to be issued against the tenants in the way prescribed by the sixth section of the above-quoted Landlord and Tenant Act, and served upon them.
12
13
Liebenstein & Spiegel, the tenants, were afterwards declared bankrupts, and one Campbell was appointed their assignee. After his appointment he demanded of Morgan, the landlord, and his bailiff, possession of the chattels taken by them in distress, and held under Morgan's warrant of distress; and against the protest of both Morgan and his bailiff, took the same and was about to sell them.
13
14
Thereupon Morgan filed a bill in the court below to enjoin him.
14
15
The assignee in bankruptcy demurred to the bill.
15
16
The question of course was: Did the law of Illinois, in force on the 14th of May, 1873, when the petition in bankruptcy was filed, confer on a landlord a lien on the personal property of his tenant independently of and prior to the levy of a warrant of distress?
16
17
If it did, then, under the settled rule of bankruptcy law, the lien would not be divested; proceedings in bankruptcy never divesting existing liens.2
17
18
But if it did not so exist, then the assignee in bankruptcy would take the property for distribution among the creditors generally; it being equally settled that no lien can be acquired after the filing of a petition in bankruptcy;3 this, in virtue of the provision of the fourteenth section of the Bankrupt Act, which enacts that on the appointment of an assignee, and on the assignment to him of the bankrupt's property and estates, the
18
19
'Assignment shall relate back to the commencement of the proceedings in bankruptcy, and thereupon, by operation of law, the title to all such property and estate, both real and personal, shall vest in said assignee, although the same is then attached on mesne process as the property of the debtor.'
19
20
The court below sustained the demurrer, thus deciding that prior to and independently of an actual levy of the warrant of distress, a landlord had not in Illinois any lien on his tenant's personal property.
20
21
Morgan, the landlord in this case, appealed to this court.
21
22
Mr. J. A. Sleeper, for Morgan, the appellant:
22
 We submit that by the common law, and the statute of the State of Illinois and the law of the State, as expounded and interpreted by its Supreme Court, the lien of the landlord on the property of the tenant for rent due is paramount and superior to the right of an execution or attaching creditor, a general assignee for the benefit of creditors, or an assignee in bankruptcy.
23
24
In Penny v. Little, the Supreme Court of Illinois had under consideration the question of the right of the landlord to distrain for rent, and held that the right existed independently of the statute and in virtue of the common law.
24
25
The same court had the question of the right of a landlord in, and lien upon, the property of his tenant, under consideration in O'Hara v. Jones,5 and referring to Penny v. Little, say:
25
26
'Under our law the landlord has the lien and the right to distrain in all cases where the rent is certain, whether the right to distrain is reserved in the lease or not. And this statutory lien in favor of the landlord is superior to other junior liens, and may be enforced against all but prior liens and bon a fide purchasers without notice; and if the goods of a tenant are seized under execution or attachment, the landlord's lien for his rent is superior and will hold the property.'
26
27
And upon these principles, thus laid down, the court decided that an assignee for the benefit of creditors, takes the property as a mere volunteer, and subject to all liens to which it is then liable; and that if liens exist upon the property when the assignment is made, they must be first discharged, in the order of their priority, and the remainder applied in execution of the trusts.
27
28
This decision, we submit, controls the subject.
28
29
We do not seek to maintain that, before the rent becomes due, the landlord has either a superior lien over execution or attaching creditors, or the right to distrain the property for the rent; but that he, all along, has an inchoate right, which may not be asserted, and cannot be, until all the conditions upon which his right to distrain are fulfilled; and that when the conditions are fulfilled, by rent becoming due and being unpaid, then eo instanti he may issue his distress warrant and seize the property.
29
30
'The landlord's lien is like the lien of an execution on personal property of the tenant. . He has the power, when the rent falls due, to issue his execution to his bailiff for collection of his rent by levy and sale of the tenant's property. The landlord's lien is of common-law growth, and does not depend upon statutory enactments for its creation. . But the landlord's right to distrain is coeval with the entire history of the common law, and has maintained its energy to the present time.'
30
31
If anything previously said in Rogers v. Dickey7 different from thiswhich we do not think is the caseit is overruled by the later decision.
31
32
In O'Hara v. Jones the court supply the reasoning which follows from the facts in Rogers v. Dickey, and hold that inasmuch as the rent was due March and the assignment was made March the landlord's lien was superior to the claim of the assignee. The court put the decision upon the ground that the rent was due. If the rent had been due in Rogers v. Dickey we have no doubt that the landlord's lien would have preceded the execution lien, whether the distress warrant had been then issued and levied or not, provided the distress had been levied before actual sale, to a bon a fide purchaser without notice, by the sheriff under his execution.
32
 No language could be clearer or more comprehensive than the language of the lease under consideration in this case. It is undeniable that, by it, the tenants intended to give the landlord, and that the landlord intended to take and receive a valid and specific first lien on the property of the tenants, as his security for the payment of this rent, in addition to the lien thereon created by the common law and the statute.
33
34
It may be argued that the distress warrant is mesne process, or in the nature of an attachment. Judge Drummond so held In re Joslyn.8 The Supreme Court of Illinois, in O'Hara v. Jones, say it is an execution issued by the land lord. They also have said substantially that it is not the commencement of a suit; that the statute which requires proceedings in court to ascertain the amount of rent due, is only in restraint of the execution of the distress warrant, but that the sale, when made, is made under and by virtue of the landlord's writ of seizure, which the Supreme Court calls his execution.
34
35
Mr. Adolphe Moses, contra, for the assignee:
35
36
We think it plain that by the Landlord and Tenant Act of Illinois, no lien is created as to the personal property of a tenant; and that the act simply recognizes the commonlaw right of distress, and attempts to regulate it. We concede that as to crops and agricultural products, the statute, acting upon consideration of public policy, grants a lien.
36
37
Our case concerns personal property alone.
37
38
In Volney Stamps v. Gilman & Co.,9 it is said:
38
39
'The distress at common law was a dormant right to take the thing into possession as a pledge. If this right was not made active by actual seizure, it was utterly impotent. The landlord's right (however it may be described) is not a jus in rem; it does not amount to a legal or equitable title.'
39
40
This, we submit, is the rule of the common law.
40
41
O'Hara v. Jones is much relied on by opposite counsel as changing in Illinois this rule.
41
42
The priority of liens under the eighth section of the Landlord and Tenant Law of Illinois had been, previously to that case, passed upon in Miles v. James, as affecting crops. The question as to the lien on personal property came up for the first time before the court in O'Hara v. Jones, and it was evidently misled by the case of Miles v. James, which represents the difference between a statutory lien on crops and the right to distrain on personal property at common law, recognized by the statute. The court inaccurately and loosely speaks of the 'landlord's lien,' 'statutory lien.'
42
43
A careful reading of the case of Penny v. Little will show that the court in that opinion carefully treats simply of the right to distrain for rent, and the phrase 'landlord's lien' is not used in the opinion.
43
44
In re Joslyn,10 Drummond, J., then district judge, and since made circuit judge, reviewed this whole subject-matter in 1870, for the guidance of the practice in the Northern District of Illinois. His conclusions, which have always been regarded as satisfactory to the bar, were, on appeal, affirmed in the Circuit Court.
44
45
'It is to be remembered that in equity the landlord may have no just preference over the many general creditors of the bankrupt, and, in view of the general scope and spirit of the Bankrupt Law itself, and of the effect which it was to have on the rights of creditors, I have thought that unless the intention of the statute was clear to allow the common law or statutory lien of the landlord to have a priority over the general creditor, it ought not to be so regarded, and, looking at the statutes in our State, bearing upon the right of the landlord to distrain for rent, it seems to me that fairly construing the two laws together, and the effect which one has upon the other it must be said that under the Bankrupt Law, as operating upon the State law, the landlord, except in the particular case referred to, must be treated as being upon the same footing as the general creditors of the bankrupt, and can only have a right to come in like them, and prove his debt in the usual way.'
45
46
Equality is the equity of the Bankrupt Law. The decree of the Circuit Court dismissing the bill should, therefore, be affirmed.
46
47
Mr. Justice DAVIS delivered the opinion of the court.
47
48
The bill in this case cannot be sustained unless the laws of Illinois conferred upon the landlord a statutory lien upon the personal property of the tenant in the county prior to the levy of the warrant. If the lien existed independently of the warrant, and the warrant was used merely as a means of enforcing it, then the theory of the bill is correct. On the contrary, if no lien could be acquired until at least the warrant was actually levied, the court below did not err in dismissing the bill.
48
49
The sixth and seventh sections of the Illinois Landlord and Tenant Statute speak of distress for rent. The sixth section prescribes the manner of proceeding, but the seventh recognizes the existence of the right itself, and is in these words: 'In all cases of distress for rent it shall be lawful for the landlord, by himself, his agent, or attorney, to seize for rent any personal property of his tenant that may be found in the county where such tenant shall reside, and in no case shall the property of any other person, although the same may be found on the premises, be liable to seizure for rent due from such tenant.' The eighth section declares that 'every landlord shall have a lien upon the crops growing or grown upon the demised premises in any year for rent that shall accrue for such year.'
49
50
These are the only provisions of the statute material to the present inquiry, and they indicate clearly enough the intention of the legislature on the subject. Manifestly it was the purpose to make a distinction in this regard between agricultural products raised on the farm and the general personal property of the tenant in the country. If this were not so, why introduce the eighth section into the law at all, for the right of distress was conferred without it. The distinction was doubtless owing to the fact that agriculture is now, and was at the passage of the law, the chief industry of the State. It could work no serious injury to trade if one kind of property alone were subject to a statutory lien, but to extend this lien to all the personal property owned by a tenant in the county would interfere with it very materially. Be this as it may, the statute does in express terms confer a lien upon the crops growing or grown upon the demised premises in any year for the rent of that year, and recognizes for other personal property in the county the right of distress as it existed at common law. At common law the landlord could distrain any goods found upon the premises at the time of the taking, but he had no lien until he had made his right active by actual seizure. A statutory lien implies security upon the thing before the warrant to seize it is levied. It ties itself to the property from the time it attaches to it, and the levy and sale of the property are only means of enforcing it. In other words, if the lien is given by statute, proceedings are not necessary to fix the status of the property. But in the absence of this statutory lien it is necessary to take proceedings to acquire a lien on the property of the tenant for the benefit of the landlord. This the landlord is enabled to do in a summary way to satisfy the rent which is due him, and in this he has an advantage as creditor over creditors at large of the tenant. It is difficult to see why the tenant, subject to this dormant right of the landlord, is not as much the owner of his effects as any other person would be who owned property and owned debts.
50
51
The statute we are considering has been the subject of consideration at the hands of the Supreme Court of Illinois. And it is contended that O'Hara v. Jones11 is authority for the position assumed by the appellant. The point decided in that case was that the landlord had a right to distrain for rent upon the property of the tenant even after he had made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors of all his property, real and personal, on the ground that the assignee of the tenant could not hold the goods free from the lien of the landlord; that the assignee took the goods of the assignor as a volunteer, and subject to all the liens to which they were then liable.
51
52
This decision evidently proceeds on the idea that the statute created a greater and different lien in favor of the landlord than is given by the common-law right of distress. But the court, in the recent case of Hadden v. Knickerbocker,12 while adhering to the point actually decided in O'Hara v. Jones, repudiate this idea and say that the lien is given the landlord upon growing crops, 'but no specific lien is given upon other property of the tenant.' This case protects bon a fide purchasers who have paid value for the property, with notice that rent was due the lessor and that he was about to distrain, although in O'Hara v. Jones it would seem that purchasers are not to be treated as bon a fide unless they bought without notice.
52
53
It is argued that the basis of the decision in O'Hara v. Jones is that the landlord's lien for rent is superior to that of a creditor holding under execution or attachment, and there are expressions in the opinion which tend in that direction, but the court to reach that conclusion would be obliged to overrule Rogers v. Dickey,13 and this case is not even noticed in the opinion of the court.
53
54
The question in Rogers v. Dickey, as stated by the court, was 'whether an execution delivered to the sheriff and in his hands at the time a distress warrant was levied took precedence of the levy by the constable, where there had been no sale of the property levied upon.' The property levied on was on the demised premises, and the court, on full consideration, held that the sheriff, who had in the meantime taken the property from the constable, was justified in the proceeding, and this, too, on the general principles of law, for no point is made of superior right in the levy of the constable by virtue of the Landlord and Tenant Act. This decision could not have been reached if, in the opinion of the court, the landlord had a lien on the property prior to the seizure under the warrant, for the court, in Miles v. James,14 held that the statutory lien of the eighth section on growing crops was a prior lien to an execution.
54
55
But it is unnecessary to consider the cases further, for whatever may be the scope of some of the decisions in the State, the exact point we are considering was decided, as we understand it, in the recent case of Hadden v. Knickerbocker,15 and, indeed, the question does not seem to have been passed upon in any other case. If, as is said in that case, the statute creates no lien in favor of the landlord on the general property of the tenant in the county, until the levy of the distress warrant, then the question arises, whether the appellant acquired any right to the property in question by reason of his levy as against the assignee of the bankrupts and against the rights of the other creditors. It may become important in other cases to determine whether the lien acquired by the levy, to become operative, must not be perfected in conformity with the provisions of the statute on the subject, but in the view we take of the rights of the parties to this suit, it is not necessary to consider the question. The question might arise where the levy was before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, and the subsequent proceedings, taken after this was done, were not in conformity with the provisions of the statute. The levy in this case was, however, made after the institution of bankruptcy proceedings, but before the decree in bankruptcy was rendered.
55
56
The fourteenth section of the Bankrupt Act declares that the assignment in bankruptcy shall relate back to the commencement of proceedings, and by operation of law vest the title of the estate of the bankrupt in the assignee, notwithstanding the same is then attached on mesne process as the property of the debtor. It is argued that a distress warrant, being the act of the landlord himself, is not an attachment upon mesne process. This is true according to the technical signification of the term, but the meaning of the term in this connection embraces any proceeding by which a lien is first acquired. The object of the law was evidently to prevent any one procuring a lien after the filing of the petition who had not got it before. If the lien existed before the filing of the petition, it could be enforced in the bankrupt court; but if it did not exist the purpose of the law was to prevent its being brought into existence by any proceeding whatever. If this were not so, as soon as it was known that the petition was filed the provisions of the law might be easily evaded. The main purpose which the Bankrupt Act seeks to accomplish is to distribute the property of the bankrupt equally among his creditors, and in order to do this the creditor who has not, when proceedings are begun, such a security as binds the property is prevented from obtaining it, and thus securing a preference over another creditor. There is no good reason why the law should protect a landlord in the issuing of a distress warrant, and repudiate an equally meritorious creditor in the levy of an attachment. If a distress warrant, where no further proceedings are necessary to perfect the lien, is not, strictly speaking, an attachment upon mesne process, yet, under the Illinois statute, as has been remarked by an eminent judge,16 it is in the nature of mesne process. The statute requires that a copy of the distress warrant be immediately filed in court; the party against whom it issues summoned; the amount due from him ascertained and entered upon the records of the court. It is then made the duty of the court to certify to the officer making the levy, the amount of the debt, and this certificate is his authority to make the sale, which certificate, with the proceedings indorsed upon it, must be returned into court.
56
57
It will thus be seen that the landlord, after he levies his warrant, can progress no further until the court has sanctioned the proceeding. The certificate that is issued, if not final process in the ordinary sense of the term, resembles it, and the distress warrant, if not mesne process issuing out of a court, is similar to it. The effect of the distress warrant is to seize the property and hold it for the purpose of enforcing the claim of the landlord upon it, and an ordinary attachment upon mesne process does nothing more for the general creditor. Both have to be returned into court and action taken on them before the property can be sold. Each is process through which a lien is obtained, but by neither can the lien be made available, unless through some final proceeding. There is, therefore, sufficient similarity between these processes for the distress warrant to be treated as a writ in the nature of an attachment upon mesne process.
57
58
But we do not want to rest our decision on this point alone, for the fourteenth section of the Bankrupt Law is not levelled at the mode of doing a thing, but at the thing itself. It was the object of this section to prevent the acquisition of any other liens than such as existed when the petition in bankruptcy was filed, and any proceeding by which this is attempted is within the condemnation of the law.

89 U.S. 395
AMSINCK
v.
BEAN, ASSIGNEE.
October Term, 1874
1
Waiving the first two errors assigned, the single question presented for decision is whether the complainant, as the assignee of the estate of an individual partner of a debtor copartnership, can maintain a suit to recover back money previously paid to a creditor of the copartnership, upon the ground that the money was paid to such creditor in fraud of the other creditors of the firm and in fraud of the provisions of the Bankrupt Act.
1
2
Assignees in bankruptcy of the estate of an insolvent copartnership may, perhaps, maintain such a suit for such a claim, even though the money was paid by an individual partner under such an agreement to compromise his separate debts, as the assignees in such a case are required to keep separate accounts of the joint stock or property of the copartnership and of the separate estate of each member of which the copartnership is composed; and the provision is that the net proceeds of the joint stock and property shall be appropriated to pay the creditors of the copartnership, and that the net proceeds of the separate estate of each partner shall be appropriated to pay his separate creditors.
2
3
None of the proceeds of the separate estate of the individual partners can be appropriated to pay the partnership debts, unless the proceeds from that source exceed what is necessary to pay the separate debts of the partner, nor can any part of the proceeds of the joint stock or property of the copartnership be appropriated to pay the separate debts of the individual partner, unless there is an excess from that source beyond what is required to pay the partnership debts.4
3
4
These regulations show that, in cases where they apply, the assignees in bankruptcy of the joint stock and property of a copartnership are required to administer the separate estate of the individual members of the firm or company as well as the described estate of the copartnership, but the Bankrupt Act contains no regulations of a corresponding character applicable in a case where an individual member of a copartnership is adjudged a bankrupt without any such decree against the copartnership or the other partner or partners of which the copartnership is composed.
4
5
Instead of that the Bankrupt Act provides that in all other respects the proceedings against partners shall be conducted in the like manner as if they had been commenced and prosecuted against one person alone. Partners are not entitled in any case to come in competition with the joint creditors upon the partnership funds, whatever may be the rights and equities which would otherwise attach between them and the bankrupt partner or partners.
5
6
Where all the partners become bankrupt the general rule is that the separate estate of one partner shall not claim against the joint estate of the partnership in competition with the joint creditors, nor shall the joint estate claim against the separate estate in competition with the separate creditors.5
6
7
Doubt upon that subject cannot be entertained, and it is equally clear that a solvent partner cannot prove his own separate debt against the separate estate of the bankrupt partner, so as to come in competition with the joint creditors of the partnership, for the plain reason that he is himself liable to all the joint creditors, which is sufficient to show that in equity he cannot be permitted to claim any part of the funds of the bankrupt before all the creditors to whom he is liable are fully paid.6
7
8
Neither can a solvent partner prove against the separate estate of the bankrupt partner in competition with the separate creditors of the bankrupt until all the joint creditors of the partnership are paid or fully indemnified, for if a dividend were reserved to such a party on such proof the joint creditors might be injured by such solvent partner stopping the surplus of the separate estate, which would otherwise be carried over to the joint estate, or the separate creditors might be injured by the funds being stopped and the transmission of the same be delayed.7
8
9
Two exceptions are admitted to that rule: (1.) Where the property of a partner has been fraudulently applied for the purposes of the partnership. (2.) Where a distinct trade is prosecuted by one or more of the members of the firm.8
9
10
Subject to the preceding rules, as explained, the solvent partners retain their full right, power, and authority over the partnership property after bankruptcy, in the same manner and to the same extent as if no bankruptcy of a particular partner had occurred. Their lien also remains in full force, not only to have the partnership funds applied to the discharge of the partnership debts and liabilities, but also to the discharge of all the debts due by the partnership to them or any one of them, as well as for their own distributive shares, if any, in the surplus.9
10
11
Debts due by the bankrupt partner to the partnership are entitled to priority in preference to the debts due by him to his separate creditors, and if the joint funds prove insufficient to discharge his debt to the partnership the solvent partners have a right to prove the deficiency against the separate estate of the bankrupt pari passu with the separate creditors.10
11
12
Bankruptcy, it is said, when decreed by a competent tribunal, dissolves the copartnership, but the joint property remains in the hands of the solvent partner or partners, clothed with a trust to be applied by him or them to the discharge of the partnership obligations and to account to the bankrupt partner or his assignee for his share of the surplus.11
12
13
Exceptions undoubtedly exist to that rule where it appears that the partnership or all the partners are insolvent, even though some of them may not be in bankruptcy.12
13
14
Assets are to be marshalled between the creditors of the copartnership and the separate creditors of the partners only when there are partnership assets and separate assets of individual partners, and proceedings have been instituted against the partnership and the individual members, as provided in the thirty-sixth section of the Bankrupt Act.13
14
15
Certain exceptions also exist to that rule where both the joint and separate estates are administered by the assignees of the copartnership.14
15
16
Many decided cases support the proposition that the bankruptcy of one partner operates as a dissolution of the copartnership, but such an adjudication obtained by one partner against another will not be sustained if the real object of the petitioner is to dissolve the firm and the adjudication is not required for any other purpose.15
16
17
Involuntary proceedings in bankruptcy were instituted in this case against the senior partner of the copartnership, and it is conceded that no such proceedings have ever been commenced against the copartners or the other partner. Proofs were introduced to show that the other partner was largely indebted to the firm, and it may be conceded that the proofs are sufficient to show that the firm is insolvent, but there is nothing in the record to show that the complainant possesses any other authority to maintain the suit than what he derives by virtue of his appointment as assignee of the estate, real and personal, of the bankrupt senior partner of the copartnership.
17
18
Repeated decisions have settled the rule that an assignee of the estate of an individual partner has no such title as will enable him to call third parties to an account for partnership property, and it is difficult to see why that rule does not dispose of the case before the court.16
18
19
All of the debts embraced in the compromise agreement were partnership debts and the payments made to procure the signature of the appellants were made to discharge those debts; nor is the question affected in the least by the fact that some small part of the fund used to make those payments was earned by the senior partner in transacting the business of the copartnership subsequent to the time when the firm suspended payment. Most of the amount, it is conceded, was taken from the partnership assets, and the whole was paid as being the money of the copartnership.
19
20
Money paid under such circumstances, if it can be recovered back at all, must be claimed by the partnership in whose behalf it was paid, or by an assignee duly appointed to administer the joint estate, as it is quite clear that neither an individual partner nor his assignee can call the party to whom such a payment has been made to an account for such a payment any more than he could for any other debt due to the copartnership. If liable in fact, a voluntary payment to the appellee would not discharge the obligation, as the liability, if it exists, is to another party; nor would a judgment in this case, even if satisfied, be a bar to a subsequent suit in the name of the partnership or their duly appointed assignees.
20
21
Two principal suggestions are made in support of the theory set up by the appellees: (1.) That all the parties concerned in the attempt to effect a compromise between the debtors and their creditors proceeded as if the copartnership had previously been dissolved and as if the assets and effects of the debtor firm had been placed in the hands of the senior partner in trust to settle up the affairs of the debtors with their creditors and to pay the compromise notes. (2.) That the other partner never assented to the compromise agreement nor was he in fact a party to the final arrangement, and that the copartnership name was signed to the compromise agreement and to the notes without his authority.
21
22
Issuable matters are certainly involved in those propositions, but suppose they are fully proved, they are not sufficient to show that the other partner ever conveyed his interest in the assets and effects of the copartnership to the bankrupt partner, or that he ceased to be a joint owner of the same when the estate of the bankrupt partner was assigned and conveyed to the complainant below as his assignee.17
22
23
Nothing is exhibited in the record to warrant the conclusion that the copartnership was ever in fact dissolved before the decree in bankruptcy against the senior partner, and as the compromise notes were given in the name of the copartnership, the other partner remained liable for their payment.
23

TUCKER
v.
FERGUSON ET AL.
October Term, 1874
1
APPEAL from the Circuit Court for the Western District of Michigan.
1
2
The Flint and P ere Marquette Railway Company was a railway corporation of Michigan, and the present suit was a bill in equity brought by Tucker et al., trustees for the holders of bonds issued by the said company, which bonds were secured by a mortgage and deed of trust executed by the company to them, the said Tucker et al., as trustees, upon lands granted by Congress to the State of Michigan, and by that State granted, in a qualified way, to the company to aid in constructing a road which it was about to make; the object of the bill having been to restrain one Ferguson et al., who were supervisors and assessing officers of Osceola County, Michigan, from levying and collecting local taxes upon the said lands situate in the said county.
2
3
The general purpose of the bill was to restrain the assessment of taxes at any time on the lands granted by Congress, during the term allowed for the completion of the road. But if the court should think there was no ground for so general a restraint, then to restrain the collection of taxes which had been already assessed on the lands for the year the bill alleging that in no event were they taxable prior to April .
3
4
The case, more particularly stated, was thus:
4
5
On the 3d of June, 1856,1 Congress granted to the State of Michigan, to aid in the construction of certain proposed railroads, including one from Flint, in the southeasterly part of the State, to P ere Marquette, on Lake Michigan, in the northwestern parta distance of about one hundred and seventy miles, much of the western part of which especially was a wildernessevery alternate section of land designated by odd numbers, for six sections in width on each side of said roads, 'which lands,' said the act of Congress granting them, 'shall be held by the State of Michigan for the use and purpose aforesaid.' By the terms of the first section of the act the lands were to be located in no case further than fifteen miles from the lines of the road, and it was enacted that they should be 'exclusively applied' in the construction of the road; 'disposed of only as the work progressed, and applied to no other purpose whatsoever.'
5
6
Section third enacted that the lands thus granted to the State, should 'be subject to the disposal of the legislature thereof for the purpose aforesaid, and no other, and that the railroads shall be and remain public highways for the use of the government of the United States, free from toll or other charges upon the transportation of any property or troops of the United States.'
6
7
'That the lands hereby granted to said State shall be disposed of by said State only in manner following; that is to say, that a quantity of land not exceeding one hundred and twenty section for each of said roads, and included within a continuous length of twenty miles of each of said roads, may be sold; and when the governor of said State shall certify to the Secretary of the Interior that any twenty continuous miles of any of said roads is completed, then another quantity of land hereby granted, not to exceed one hundred and twenty sections for each of said roads having twenty continuous miles completed as aforesaid, and included within a continuous length of twenty miles of each of such roads, may be sold, and so, from time to time, until said roads are completed; and if any of said roads is not completed within ten years, 2 no further sales shall be made, and the lands unsold shall revert to the United States
7
8
Section fifth enacted that the United States mail should be transported over the road, under the direction of the Post-Office Department, at such price as Congress might by law direct.
8
9
On the 12th of February, 1857, and, of course, after the passage of the act of Congress, the Flint and P ere Marquette Company was organized under the general railroad law of Michigan. And two days after this, again, that is to say, on the 14th of February, 1857, the State of Michigan by an act enacted,
9
10
'That the lands, franchises, rights, powers, and privileges granted to, and conferred upon, the State of Michigan by an act of Congress, approved June be, and the same are hereby, accepted, with the restrictions and upon the terms and conditions contained in said act of Congress.'
10
11
'SECTION 2. So much of the aforesaid lands, &c., as are or may be granted and conferred in pursuance of said act of Congress, to aid in the construction of a railroad. . from Flint to p ere Marquette, are hereby vested fully and completely in the Flint and P ere Marquette Railway Company, according to the provisions of the act of Congress relating thereto, and the direction of the board of control hereby appointed. The said railroad company shall be subject to all the conditions, restrictions, and obligations imposed upon them by this act, as hereinafter provided.
11
12
'SECTION 3. The lands, &c., hereby conferred upon and vested in the railroad company, shall be exclusively applied in the construction of its line of road, and to no other purposes whatsoever.'
12
13
Section seventh enacted that after the completion of twenty continuous miles of road, the company might sell sixty sections of land in any twenty continuous miles of line of road, &c.; 'and after the full and final completion of the entire length of its road, and the acceptance of the same by the board of control herein provided, then the company may sell the remainder of the lands, &c., and not before.' The act further enacted,
13
14
'None of the lands hereby granted shall be liable to taxation for seven years from 1st September next [i. e., shall not be liable till September, 1863], except such parts as shall be sold or be improved.'
14
15
'SECTION 8. . For the purpose of properly managing and disposing of the lands . . the governor of the State of Michigan, together with six commissioners to be nominated by the governor and confirmed by the senate, are hereby constituted a board of control of the same, whose duty it shall be to manage and dispose of such lands in aid,' &c.
15
16
'SECTION 12. The said railroad company shall at all times and in all matters be subject to the laws of this State, and to such rules and regulations as may from time to time be enacted and provided by the legislature of the State of Michigan, in regard to the management and disposition of the said lands, not inconsistent with the provisions of this act and the act of Congress making the said grant of lands to this State, and they shall be entitled to all the immunities and privileges conferred by said laws.'
16
17
'Provided, That nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to relinquish the right of the State to any specific tax imposed upon any railroad company within this State.'
17
18
The company was bound by the nineteenth section to complete and put in running order at least twenty continuous miles during each year after 1st December, and to complete the road within seven years from 15th November next, i. e., by the 16th of November, 1864; a term, however, by both State legislation and act of Congress subsequently enlarged till March .
18
19
At the time when the Flint and P ere Marquette Railway Company was organized, all railroad companies in Michigan were liable, under a general railroad act (section forty-five), to a specific tax of one per cent. on their 'paid in capital stock.' Of course, in the case of a company like the P ere Marquette, and the other companies provided for in the act of Congress,built, all of them, chiefly by the land grant,the tax was a light one.
19
20
The twentieth section of the present act, which raised one of the important questions in the case, now made for the Flint and P ere Marquette Company, as well as for the others, a heavier tax. The section was as follows:
20
21
'SECTION 20. In consideration of the grants of land and other privileges hereby conferred . . the said several railroad companies are hereby required, within sixty days from and after the first day of each and every year, to pay into the treasury of this State, as a specific annual tax, one per cent. upon the cost of the road and its equipments and appurtenances of whatever kind; and it shall be lawful for the legislature of this State, in their discretion, after ten years, to impose upon either or each of said railroad companies the payment of a further tax upon the gross or total earnings of such road of not exceeding two per cent.; which said above several taxes shall be in lieu of all other taxes to be imposed within this State.'
21
22
The Flint and P ere Marquette Company accepted the grant made by this act.
22
23
It may be here stated, that it was afterwards enacted by Congress that the State of Michigan might authorize the sale of sixty sections, whenever the governor might certify that ten additional miles was completed. The original act, it will be remembered, had prescribed a sale of one hundred and twenty sections, on a certificate of twenty miles completed, &c. This last matter is, perhaps, unimportant.
23
24
As the reader will doubtless have observed, in reading what goes before, Congress granted the lands which it did grant to the State, to be disposed of 'only' in a certain manner in the act of grant stated. They were to be 'sold'3 from time to time, as certain lengths of the road were completed; and no other manner of disposing of them is stated in the act as contemplated. And the State of Michigan in accepting the lands, accepted them 'with the restrictions and upon the terms and conditions contained in said act of Congress.'4 It was soon found, however, as the road progressed westward, that it was coming to regions which were uninhabited, and that the land there being in a wilderness could not be sold for twenty miles ahead of even a completed twenty miles of road; that is to say, could not be sold in advance of the construction of the road through them. It was the road itself which first gave value to them. Thus is happened that no money could be got out of the lands by sale in advance of a road through the twenty miles. A plan of obviating this difficulty now suggested itself. It being found that the bonds of the company (which now had a part of its road completed) could be sold, and the funds requisite to finish the rest of the road raised on such bonds, provided they were secured by mortgage with power of sale in the mortgagee on the unsold lands, it was resolved to carry out an arrangement on this basis. The company did accordingly in September, 1866, by a mortgage and trust deed containing a power of sale and terms and conditions for the management of the trust, convey to Tucker et al. as trustees, acres of land as security for bonds to the amount of $ which bonds were issued and sold, and which were now outstanding . . except such portions thereof as had been taken up and cancelled from the proceeds of land sold for that purpose.
24
25
Subsequently the company, desiring to raise a further sum of money to enable it to prosecute the further construction of its road, made, September, 1868, a second mortgage and trust deed, by which it mortgaged and conveyed all the remaining lands of the land grant for the purpose of securing bonds to the amount of $ which were issued and sold upon the market.
25
26
It did not appear from anything in the transcript of the record sent here, what value the lands mortgaged bore to the amount of bonds issued.
26
27
Tucker and the other, as trustees, were to hold said lands together with other property in said trust deed mentioned, as security for such bondholders. The second mortgage and trust deed, like the first, contained a power of sale.
27
28
In this way funds were obtained and the road was in process of completion, when a difficulty occurred between the trustees and the assessors of Osceola County, which was the cause of the present suit.
28
29
The reader will remember that by the twentieth section of the act of the legislature of Michigan accepting the grant from Congress, it was enacted that the railroad company should pay into the treasury of the State, as a specific annual tax, one per cent. upon the cost of the road and its equipments and appurtenances of whatever kind; and that the said twentieth section made it lawful for the legislature of the State, after ten years, to impose upon the company the payment of a further tax upon the gross or total earnings of such road of not exceeding two per cent.; 'which said above several taxes,' the section declared, 'shall be in lieu of all other taxes to be imposed within this State.'5
29
30
By two subsequent actsone of the 14th and one of the 15th of February, 1859this twentieth section was repealed; the company was to sell one hundred and twenty sections on completing twenty miles, and not sell any sections before; was to have a right when the road was finished through its entire length and accepted by the board of control, to sell all the remaining lands; all the lands granted were declared to be free from taxation for seven years, from September i. e., till September and the company was declared to be subject to the tax imposed in the already mentioned forty-fifth section of the general railroad law of by which section a tax of one per cent. upon the capital stock paid in was imposed, which tax of one per cent. upon the capital stock paid in, it was by the new acts enacted
30
31
'Shall be in lieu of all other taxes upon the property of the said company, whether real, personal, or mixed, except penalties by this act imposed.'
31
32
This tax of one per cent. on capital paid innecessarily a very small tax, as we have already remarked, in the case of a road built chiefly or wholly by land grants of Congresswas, of course, more favorable to the company than that laid by the twentieth section of the old act now repealed.
32
33
On the 18th of April, 1871, came another act, laying by its thirty-seventh sectionan act and a section of much importance in this casea new tax; that is to say, 'an annual tax upon gross receipts.' The section, after laying this tax, proceeded:
33
34
'This tax shall be in lieu of all other taxes upon the property of said company, whether real, personal, or mixed, except penalties imposed by law, except real property not necessary for carrying on the ordinary operations or franchises of their road.
34
35
'Provided, Only such lands granted to any railroad company shall be liable to local taxation as are or may be opposite to and coterminous with the constructed portion and portions of said roads respectively.
35
36
'And provided further, That no such lands shall be subject to taxation until after the expiration of three years from and after the 1st day of April, A.D. and until after three years from the date of the certificate showing that such lands have been earned by said railroad company, after which time said lands shall be taxed as other lands, except as hereinafter provided.
36
37
'And provided further, That the lands of the several land-grant railroad companies, opposite to and coterminous with their lines as now in operation, shall be subject to taxation in two years from said 1st day of April, A.D. '
37
38
Finally, came an act of May a 'general railroad law,' as it was called, and the cause of the present difficulty. This act, which provided for the incorporation of railroad companies, the details of their organization, and which prescribed a great variety of rules, regulations, &c., in regard to their stock, routes, rights, liabilities, power to borrow money, obligation to pay, & c., &c., enacted:
38
39
'SECTION 3. Every company . . shall, on or before the 1st day of July in each year, pay to the State treasurer an annual tax upon the gross receipts of said company; which amount or tax shall be in lieu of all other taxes upon the property of such companies, except such real estate as is owned and can be conveyed by such corporation under the laws of this State and not actually occupied in the exercise of its franchises, and not necessary or in use in the proper operation of its road; but such real estate so excepted shall be liable to taxation in the same manner, for the same purposes, and to the same extent, and subject to the same conditions and limitations as to assessment for taxation, to taxation, and to the collection and return of taxes thereon as is other real estate in the several townships within which the same may be situated.'
39
40
Under this lawthe Flint and P ere Marquette Railway not being yet finished, but on the contrary having forty miles yet to make out of the hundred and seventy which if finished it would consist ofthe defendants below, Ferguson and others, supervisors of Osceola County, taxed for the year the lands which the company had by the two mortgages already mentioned, mortgaged with power of sale to Tucker and others, to raise funds to complete the road; these lands being none of them opposite to or coterminous with the line of the railroad in operation in April, 1871.
40
41
There had been issued and sold of the bonds, and were still outstanding in the hands of purchasers, on the 1st of January, 1873:

$
The lands now taxed, as stated already, were in Osceola County. There had been in that county,
Originally, acres,
Of which the company had sold, acres,
Leaving unsold and now taxed, acres,
Hereupon, on the 20th of August, the road being still unfinished to the extent already stated, and $being unpaid out of the $of bonds issued or secured and capable of being issuedthe trustees, Tucker et al., filed a bill, the bill in the present suit, praying an injunction on the assessors against levying the taxes laid.
I. The bill referred to the act of Congress of June granting the land to the State of Michigan, to be held by it to aid in the construction of a railroad between Flint and P ere Marquette, to be subject to the disposal of the legislature of the State for that purpose alone, and to be sold by it, and to be applied to the road; the said road to be a public highway for the use of the government of the United States, and the lands to revert to the United States unless the road were made within ten years.
It referred also to the act of the State of February accepting the said grant, 'with the restrictions and upon the terms and conditions contained in said act of Congress.'
It alleged that the title of lands, &c., granted by Congress to the State, were by the last act vested fully and completely in the Flint and P ere Marquette Company, then just incorporated, to be applied exclusively to the construction of the road, and to no other purpose whatsoever.
It set forth further that the company, to enable it to raise money, for the purpose of constructing the road, had made the two mortgages and trust-deeds of September, 1866, and September, giving the history of them exactly as already statedconveying certain parts of the lands to the complainants as trustees to secure certain bonds, 'which bonds,' said the bill, 'were issued and sold, and which are now outstanding in the hands of divers persons unknown . . excepting such portion thereof as has been taken up and cancelled from the proceeds of lands held for that purpose . . that the said trust deeds contained a power of sale, and terms and conditions for the management of the trust.'
[The bill referred to the mortgages and deeds of trust as annexed to the bill. But none were annexed in the transcript of the record that came here.REP.]
The bill submitted that the title to the lands taken by the State under the act of June was taken in trust for the specific purpose in the act named, and that it was a violation of the trust thus created for the State to assume to derive a revenue from them, as it was now seeking to do by its general railroad law of before they were sold.
II. The bill further alleged that the said general railroad law violated the obligation of CONTRACTS made by the State with the company. For that,1st. By the twentieth section of the act of the legislature of Michigan, of accepting the grant, and by the grant from the State to the company, and by the company, construction of the road, a contract had been made with the company that none but specific taxes should be imposed upon it; that accordingly the company's lands should be free from taxation.
2d. By the act of the legislature of Michigan of April it was, in the thirty-seventh section of the act, provided that railroad companies, under the provisions of the act, should pay a specific tax upon gross receipts, and provided that only such lands granted to any railroad company should be liable to local taxation as might be opposite and coterminous with the constructed portion of its road; and that no such lands should be subject to taxation until after the expiration of three years from April nor until after three years from the date of the certificate showing that such lands had been earned; and providing further that the lands of the several land-grant companies opposite and coterminous with their line then in operation should be subject to taxation in two years from April 
The bill now alleged that the lands which the supervisors of Osceola County, the defendants in the case, had listed for taxation for the year were not, any of them, opposite to or coterminous with the line of the said Flint and P ere Marquette Railway Company, in operation in April, 1871; and, therefore, that under the proviso of the section they could not, even if in view of former enactments they were taxable at all, be taxed before April, 1874.
III. The bill made another point.
In the year as previously thereto, railroad corporations in Michigan were taxed by specific taxes; and a constitution of the State adopted in that year, and in force when the Flint and P ere Marquette Company was organized, and all the other matters above spoken of were occurring, thus ordained:
'The State may continue to collect all specific taxes accruing to the treasury under existing laws. The legislature may provide for the collection of specific taxes from banking, railroad, plank-road, and other corporations hereafter created.'
The bill stated that from the very organization of the State until the year the property of railway companies in Michigan had never been taxed by local assessment and taxation, nor in any other manner than by specific taxes. And it insisted that under the constitution of the State the property was liable to specific taxation only, and that it was not competent for the legislature of the State to change the manner and mode of taxation in respect to such property.
The argument meant to be presented by the bill, in its making this statement was this: that specific taxes having been the sort of taxes always collected from railroad corporations, prior to the adoption of the constitution, and that instrument having authorized the continuance of such taxes, it was meant that those taxes and no others should be collected; that the language though, in form, permissive, was, in fact, mandatory and restrictive; since, if it were not so construed, the clause might as well be stricken out; the power to levy all sorts of taxes, specific as well as others, existing under the general legislative power of the State.
The bill stated that the Flint and P ere Marquette Railway Company had been assessed, and had paid each year a specific tax, levied and collected under the laws of Michigan, and that the sum of $had been paid for the specific tax assessed under the general railroad law of which last named sum was due and was paid on the 1st day of July, 1873.
The defendants demurred to the bill. To understand one ground on which their demurrer was meant to be founded it is necessary to mention another provision of the constitution of Michigan, which as they conceived bore in their favor. It was thus:
'Corporations may be formed by general laws; but shall not be created by special act except for municipal purposes. All laws passed pursuant to this section may be amended, altered, or repealed.'The manner in which, according to the ideas of the counsel for the State, this provision bore on the subject of controversy was this: For that whereas the contracts which the railroad company alleged to have been made not to tax, &c., were made by the general railroad laws of these laws were, by this provision of the constitution, open to be amended, altered, or repealed.
The reader will have remarked that the ground other than that of specific contract relied on by the bill for injunction, was that the State was a trustee for sale as prescribed by the Act of Congress, and as such trustee could not tax the lands before they were sold.
In argument in the court below this ground was sought to be strengthened by reliance on the interest which both the United States and the State had in the lands the subject of the trust, and on the ground of contract made by the trust.
The position thus, by way of addition or as ancillary or explanatory, sought to be wrought into the grounds for relief, were exfoliated in three propositions, thus:
'1st. That the interest of the United States in the lands was not so completely extinguished as that they were subject to State taxation in and would not be so extinguished until the State had finally executed the trust created by the act of Congress granting them, by the application of the proceeds of the sales of the lands to the cost of constructing the railroad.
'2d. That in executing this trust the State still retained, as to the road uncompleted or unpaid for, an interest in and supervision over the unsold lands, which could not be relinquished until the trust was finally executed as aforesaid; and that this interest and supervision was inconsistent with the right to tax the lands until after they had been sold.
'3d. That the National and State legislation granting the lands to and the acceptance of them by the railway companies, on the stipulated terms, and their compliance with those terms, created a contract between the State and the company, that the lands should be applied exclusively and without diminution to the construction of the railroads, which contract would be impaired by taxation before they had been sold and their proceeds so applied.'
The court dismissed the bill.
In its opinion it said:
'The three propositions which in different forms object to the tax because the lands are 'unsold' are sufficiently answered by deciding that within the meaning of the act of Congress and the legislation of the State, the disposition of the lands already made constitutes a sale.
'. . What the General Government intended has been accomplished. The act has been done which under the statute vested the power of sale.'
'A power of sale to raise money is well executed by the creation of a mortgage for that purpose.'
To the propositions that, under the constitution of Michigan, it was unconstitutional to tax the corporation other than by a specific tax, and that by the twentieth section of the act of and the thirty-seventh section of the act of the State had entered into contracts not to tax the lands, the court said, that an exemption from taxation could not be inferred unless an intention to exempt appeared by language wholly unambiguous; that no such intention here thus appeared in either of the sections relied on; and further, that so far as regarded the provision of the constitution and the twentieth section of the act of neither applied to the property in question; and that no such contract appeared in the section of the act of 
In this court the following errors were assigned:
'That the interest of the United States in the lands was not so far extinguished that they were liable to taxation by the State.
'That the State, as trustee, has still an interest in the lands inconsistent with taxation.
'That there was a contract between the State and the company that the lands should be applied exclusively and without diminution of value to the construction of the road, and that this contract is impaired by taxing them before they are sold and the proceeds so applied.
'That the twentiety section of the act of the legislature of contained a contract that none but specific taxes should be imposed upon railroad companies, and that the taxation of the lands in question under the act of was a violation of that contract.
'That the State had no power to impair this contract to the prejudice of the company and its creditors.
'That the thirty-seventh section of the act of contained a grant that lands opposite to and coterminous with the constructed portions of the road should not be subject to local taxation until three years from the 1st of April, and that the taxation of the lands in question of impaired that grant, and was illegal.
'That the constitution of Michigan prohibits the imposition of any but specific taxes upon railway corporations.'
From the decree dismissing the bill the trustees took this appeal.
It should be here stated that not only at the time when the bill in this case was filed, August 20th, but afterwards when the case was argued in the court below, and even when the briefs for this court were printed and the above-quoted assignment of errors was made, the road was not yet finished; no rails being yet laid on the western end. So that the reversionary and other interest in the United States under the terms of its grant to the State of Michigan was a matter that could be insisted upon in argument with more or less plausibility or reason.
On the case coming here for argument, however, February and after it had been called, it was announced at the bar, by the counsel for the State of Michigan, that the road was now built through to its western terminus and open for travel along its entire route, and had been accepted by the State of Michigan. And this was not denied by the other side.
Hence in the oral argument by the complainants here, the reversionary interest of the United States in the lands was not pressed as it had been in the court below, and even in the briefs, though the points as there made were left to stand; the counsel for the company still asserting that the State's trusteeship was still so far unexecuted, that the clause providing for the reversion of the lands to the United States under the Act of Congress was an important factor in ascertaining the extent of the State's responsibility as trustee.
However, as to the immediate object of the billan injunction against collecting the taxes laid for at which date, as the bill alleged, forty miles of the track were not laid, out of the one hundred and seventy necessary to be laidthe argument from interest retained, perhaps, whatever weight it had originally.
Mr. T. J. Coffey, for the appellants:
The case shows that the lands had been mortgaged to trustees to secure payment of the railroad bonds; that the mortgage conferred on the trustees power to sell the lands and apply their proceeds to pay the bonds, and that some lands, but not all, had been sold, and some bonds, but not all, had been paidin other words, that the trust was in a process of execution but not fully executedwhen the tax complained of was laid.
Our first position therefore is, that although the tracks of the road may be laid, and cars may be running on them, yet so long as all this has been brought about no otherwise than with money borrowed on the security of the lands and under a trust created at the time of the loan, and as a condition of it, that the money lent and yet unpaid should be repaid by a sale of the landsthat is to say, so long (within, of course, the term limited by statute for finishing the road)so long as these lands remain as they are, on a trust for sale, in process of execution, but not fully executed, so long the State cannot tax them.
This, our first point, is independent of and rests on different grounds from our second one, which alleges a specific contract not to tax the lands; and our third one, based on the provision in the constitution of Michigan.
I. The act of Congress of granted the lands, &c., 'to aid in the construction' of the road. It enacts that the lands thus granted 'shall be held by the State of Michigan,' for the use and purpose 'aforesaid, and be 'exclusively applied in the construction' of the road, and 'shall be applied to no other purpose whatsoever.'6 The lands thus granted to the State of Michigan are, indeed, to be 'subject to the disposal of the legislature thereof' (that is to say, they are to be disposed of by the legislature), but they are to be disposed of 'for the purposes aforesaid and no other.'7
And as respects the party to dispose of them and the manner of disposal, they are not to be disposed of by anybody, either artificial or natural that the State may transfer the trust to, nor to be disposed of by the legislature, even as in its good judgment it sees fit. They must be disposed of only by the State, and in a particular way, prescribed by the act of Congress. For the act of that body says:
'SECTION 4. The lands hereby granted to the said State shall be disposed of by said State only in manner following.'
And the same section prescribes the manner. That manner is through the process of sale, and sale of a special sort. The lands may be 'sold;' but not sold in a body, but sold in certain quantities, not all at one time, but from time to time 'as the work progresses' and 'until said road is completed.'
The act, in short, creates a trust; a trust to hold certain lands; to apply them through a process of sale, and sale only, and sale made in certain quantities and from time to time, and as the construction of the railroad advanced, in aid of the construction of that road.8 And the State of Michigan is the party invited to act as trustee. Nothing is said in any part of the act of Congress about any company created or to be created.
The purpose of Congress in all this was clear. Congress wanted to have a railroad for the transportation of its mails, its troops, munitions of war, and other property. The State, of its own means, could not build the road. Capitalists, of theirs, would not. Congress, therefore, comes in and supplies the effective means. Aiding thus munificently, it desired also that its munificence should not be brought to naught, either through the sinister interests or the bad judgment or the reckless doings of any persons to whom, as directors of a corporation or otherwise, the execution of the enterprise might be committed.
Congress, we say, wanted roads for important purposes of the nation; but it did not want, even for these purposes, roads built in fraud. It did not want roads on which common laborers had bestowed their daily toil only to be wronged out of their raily wages. It did not want transportation over rails which had been furnished by contractors who would be ruined by a misplaced confidence in the corporation making the road. And it wanted, we may believe, as little as it wanted any other disgrace and immorality, the disgrace and immorality of repudiated railroad bonds, or even of railroad bonds which though acknowledged were yet dishonored and unpaid.
Hence all the particularity of the act in everything. A trustee of the highest dignitya Stateis selected. No authority is given to mortgage or otherwise incumber, at any time or in any way, the lands conveyed in trust; or to resort to any other of the numerous well-known equivocal expedients, by which so many roads in our country have been made and so many makers of them ruined.
The State of Michigan understood all this. Its act of February speaks of the grant offered by Congress to it as one offered with 'restrictions,' and upon 'terms and conditions.' The State was free to reject the proffered trust or to accept it. She accepted it; and accepted it in so many words, 'with the restrictions and upon the terms and conditions contained in said act of Congress.'
The State of Michigan thus became a trustee. And a part of the trust was that the State of Michigan should remain and act as trustee; that IT should hold the lands; that IT, of course, should make the sales prescribed.
And while, of course, the State could act only by officers and agents, including, if desirable, a railroad company specially incorporated to take charge of the details of the trust, it was still the State that was bound to do all that was done, and without the consent of the United States the State could neither pass away the legal estate of the trust nor disown its own obligation to administer the trust, nor change in any way the terms prescribed for its equitable parts by the acts of Congress, by which it was created.
Now, it will be conceded, we assume, that if the State is trusteeis herself holding the lands and administering the trust she cannot, before the lands are 'sold'sold within the meaning of the act of Congresstax them. In Michigan, as in other States, taxes make a lien and are payable annually. If not paid, the lands are sold, and all prior titles and trusts are swept away.
The reasons why the State, while acting as trustee, cannot tax are plain. A party owning a large body of valuable lands, which the State has no right to tax, conveys those untaxable lands to her IN TRUST to apply them through a process of salein other words, to sell them and apply the proceedsto building a road in which, when made, the party founding the trust shall have certain rights of user, and also a right of having the lands, or a part of them, back again, if the road is not made. And the State accepts the lands on these trusts. Of course she can do nothing which renders the trust less easy of accomplishment, which imperils its existence in any way, or which abstracts or gives a direction different from that contemplated by the founder of the trust, to any part of the trust property, or of its proceeds. Her relations to the trust forbid her to do anything of this sort, and especially in the case of a trust where it is a very part of the trust, explicitly made known, that the whole of the trust property is to be applied 'exclusively' to the building of the road, and 'to no other purpose whatsoever.'And all this is true even if she have a right to shift and do shift the execution of the trust from herself to some one else; whether an individual or a corporation. She cannot, without the consent of the party founding the trust, change or even modify the trusts themselves; she having accepted the trusts from that other, and the founder of the trusts having the same interest in the proper execution of the trusts, whether State, corporation, or private person administer them. The trusts remain exactly as they were, whoever may be trustee. And the State, having once recognized and approved the trust by accepting the trust property, she can, at a later day, when the legal estate of the trust is transferred to anotherif it is transferredby no act of her own any more impede or misdirect the operations of the trust, in the hands of the new trusteeor imperil its existencethan she could while she herself was acting as trustee and administering the trust.
All this rests on general principles of the law of trusts; a fundamental one of which is that trustees and even all who stand in fiduciary relations do nothing inconsistent with their positions; in other words, be faithful to their trusts or fiduciary relations.
It would be true, we rather suppose, if the founder were a private individual conveying to any other private individual, in trust, for a beneficial public purpose, lands previously free from taxes (or possibly lands previously taxable), the same to be devoted exclusively to that purpose, there being no fund provided from which to pay taxes, and the State knowing all this, and while knowing it all, approving and encouraging the grant on the trusts specified.
Whether true or not, in the case just supposed, it is certainly true when the United States is the party founding the trust, out of the public lands; when it, for the purposes of the Federal government is interested, in every part of the matter; in the making of the road primarily, that it may be able to transport its mails and troops and property, and in its not being made, contingently, by its right, through reverter, in the lands if the road be not made.
The State then, until the lands pass out of the trustee through the process of salein other words, until the trust is executedbe the trustee the State or the assignee of the Stateis estopped from taxing:
1st. On the general principle of the law of trusts.
2d. By the fact that the United States is interested in the proper and complete execution of the trust, and interested not to have its execution either impeded, misdirected, imperilled, or destroyed.
We need not, under this second head, talk about rights of reverter or of re-entry for conditions broken, especially not in the present form of action; nor of the freedom from State power of the instrumentalities of the United States. It is enough that the United States are interested in the way just above stated.
Now, there has been no 'sale,' unless made by either:
1st. The second section of the act of vesting the lands in a body, and at the same moment in the Flint and P ere Marquette Railway, according to the act of fCongress relating thereto, and the board of control of the State which the act constituted; or by
2d. The mortgage with power to sell. . 
In regard to the first, it is enough to say:
1. The State, mere trustee, had no power to sell, except in the way that the act of Congress prescribed, that is to say, in certain amounts and as the road advanced. Any attempt to sell in another way would have been a breach of trust, a fraud on the act, and a mere nullity.
2. The transaction had no aspect of a sale in fact. The company gave no money. The State received none.
3. The act of the State of Michigan shows that the State did not pretend to sell, nor even to discharge herself of the duty and position of a trustee, but meant only to employ an agent or department charged with this special matter, one constituted by herself to act for her and under the direction of her officers; the duty of executing the trust remaining still with her. This is her language:
'SECTION 2. All the lands &c., which are or may be granted and conferred in pursuance of said act of Congress . . are hereby vested fully and completely in the Flint and P ere Marquette Railway Company, according to the provisions of the act of Congress relating thereto, and the direction of the board of control hereby appointed.'
There is, indeed, in the words of the act'are hereby vested fully and completely in the Flint and P ere Marquette Railway Company, according to the provisions relating thereto'enough (taking the expressions by themselves) on which to found an argument that the State meantnot to sellbut to transfer the legal estate of the lands, &c., to the company as a trustee in its place; in other words to relieve itself from the execution of the trust, and to put it wholly on the Flint and P ere Marquette Company.
To this, one answer is that it was a part of the trust as granted to and as accepted by the State that it should itself execute the trust; and that it had no power, without the assent of the United States, to pass away its duty to another.
But a better answer is, that the State did not mean to get out of the obligations of the trust, and put them on anybody else. And this is shown by reference to other parts of the act.
By the first section of that same act in which the above-quoted words make the second, the State eo instanti in which it makes the transfer, accepts the trust, 'with the restrictions, and upon the terms and conditions' contained in the act of Congress; one of which conditions was that the lands granted 'shall be held by the State of Michigan,' and also that they 'shall be disposed of by said State,' and shall be disposed of by it 'only in manner following'that manner being prescribed, and bearing no resemblance to a transfer in gross, but being by 'sales' in certain quantities, from time to time, and as the road progressed. The State, we assume, did not accept a trust only in the same instant to throw it up, and also to throw it up in violation of its duty.
In addition. Though the lands are vested fully and completely in the company by the words above mentioned, yet it is not the duty of, nor have the company any power in itself to manage and dispose of them. That power and that duty by the eighth section9 belongs exclusively to the board of control; a board composed of the governor of the State and of six persons, to be appointed by him with the consent of the State senate. And as if this were not enough, by the twelfth section,10 the company is made 'at all times and in all matters' subject to the rules which the State, through its legislature, may prescribe, 'in regard to the management and disposition of the lands.'
It is obvious, therefore, that the Flint and P ere Marquette Company was nothing but a depository of the barest legal title, with a residuary beneficial interest in itself as to the lands, which by a final completion of the road in the mode contemplated by Congressin other words, by the execution of the trustshould be earned. The board of control of the State and the legislature in other words the State itself, through its board of control and its legislaturewere to manage and dispose of the lands; the company being absolutely subjected to whatever the legislature by rules and regulation might from time to timethat is to say at any and all timesprovide, consistently with the act of Congress.
Was not the State of Michigan then still the real trustee? the manager and disposer, through its board of control and legislature, of everything in or about the lands? And if it was inconsistent with its relations to the trust or to the United States to tax before this so-called vesting fully and completely in the railroad corporation, was it not so equally afterwards?
But as we have already said, if the State had divested itself completely of its trusteeship, the trusts remained as they were, and the State, having encouraged and approved of them, could not impede, imperil, misdirect, or destroy them by taxation of anybody in the execution of them.
No sale then has been made up to this date, and the State then still remains the trustee; the trustee to sell still. Up to this time she has no power to tax.
2. Has the State executed her trust and made a 'sale' by the mortgage to Tucker, made doubtless through or with the approval of its agents?
The learned judge below says that it has, and this mortgage it is, according to his idea, which makes the 'sale,' which, if made, makes the land taxable. . He does not attempt to rest a sale on the second section 'vesting the lands fully and completely' in the company. He saw plainly that they were thus vested by this section in the company only as an agent of the State; the State managing everything, 'according to the provisions of the act of Congress,' by its own board of control.
Now, in this assumption of the learned judge below, he assumes exactly that which this court, in Railroad Company v. McShane, just now decided,11 declined on a stronger case to decide. There the trust was to 'sell or dispose of' the property mortgaged. It was pressed on the court that this, if not a sale, was at least a 'disposition of' the lands. But this court would not rest the case on such ground.
Undoubtedly, when Congress conveyed the lands to the State of Michigan on a trust to 'sell' them, that body had no idea of anything but a sale in the ordinary meaning of the word; a final operation where one party gets a deed in fee simple and keeps the land, and the other receives the money, and is never expected to be called on to repay it.
In most States of this Union a mortgage bears no resemblance, even in law, to so much as a defeasible conveyance, to say nothing of a sale. In almost all of our States, and especially in Michigan, it is a lien, and no more. It conveys no title. That remains with the mortgagor. A chief justice of Michigan speaks of the expression 'equity of redemption' as an antiquated phrase;12 and so to half the bar it is.
When you come to speak of the two things in fact, and in reference to a matter like the present one, the difference between a mortgage and a sale is as wide. If the lands are sold and the company gets money, the road is built and the company is free from debt. But when they are mortgaged only, if sold for taxesand we may mention as a fact that some of these very lands have been so soldthe company has lost, perhaps, half of that which it should have applied exclusively to build the road; it is still in debt, while with all this catastrophe its creditor is entirely unsecured!
The truth is that in the present case the mortgaging was a mere step in the way to a sale. It was to bring into existence, subserve and advance the capacity of an actual sale. Money was borrowed, and had to be borrowed, to build the road, and the road when built gave the practical capacity to sell at high rates. Sale, however, not mortgaginga complete out and out disposition, not mere incumbrancingwas the object of the conveyance to the trustee here appellant. But the sale had to be conducted through this preliminary stage. The mortgaging gave a sort of resting-place, where the company might prepare things for its further and real purpose. The trust was not for a single object, but for two objects conjoined, or rather two objects one sequent to the other. The conveyance to the trustees was as much to sell after mortgaging as to mortgage before sale, and more so. It was really to mortgage first in order to sell to good advantage afterwards. Indeed, could there have been as good a sale without a mortgage as with, no mortgage would have been given.
The lands now taxed have, therefore, never been 'sold' at all; though they are now held on a trust to be sold, and to pay a debt contracted in building the road.
Then the question is this: When there is a trust, in the first place to sell lands, and after sale to apply the lands meaning, meaning, of necessity, the proceeds of themexclusively to a particular purpose, as ex. yr., the construction of a railroadone purpose of the trust being obviously, as is shown by numerous limitations, terms, and conditions put on the trustee, as to his times and modes of sale, to provide money to pay everybody who has contributed to build the road, so that to the extent of the full value of the lands it may be clear of debt the question we say is this: When there is a trust to sell in order to build a road, and in order that by means of the existence of the road itself you may be able to sell, you borrow, and as a condition of the loan to you, mortgage in trust with a power to sell, and owe that borrowed money stillthe question, we say, is Is your trust executed before you have sold, even though you have mortgaged? And if thus, while in a way to selling and for the purpose of enabling you to sell at all, and for the further purpose of assisting you to sell advantageously, you mortgage before sale, are you not morally and equitably bound to apply the proceeds of your sale to satisfy your creditors by mortgage, whose money has been put by them into the construction of your road; and who do in some sort have a right to be subrogated to the claims of your day laborers and furnishers, to satisfy whose claims you were bound to sell, and whose claims, have been discharged by the money raised upon mortgage?
The mortgagees, of course, have the power to compel you to sell. And why? Only because it is the duty of the trustees to sell under the power of sale in the mortgages. But if it is their duty to sell under that power, and pay the mortgages, and they do not sell and pay them, how is the trust, which has been assumed under the act of Congress, executed? It is not executed at all.
It will not do to assert, as did the court below, that 'what the General Government intended has been accomplished;' that the act had been done which, under the statute, vested the power of 'sale.' This we deny. What the government intended has not been accomplished. The act which, under the statute, vested the power of sale, has not been done. The government conveyed land not to build a road simply, but to build a road in a way that it prescribed in detail, and which to the whole extent of the land given, should leave no debts behind to any one, and which by securing a sale of every alternate odd section should secure a probable settlement of it, and so secure a sale of its own even ones. It made a gift, but a gift with 'restrictions, terms, and conditions.' May you build a road in a way the reverse in all particulars of the way prescribed, and which does leave a vast debt behind, and does not secure any probable sale of the unsold sections retained by the government, and yet say that what the General Government intended has been done? May a donee of a gift with conditions prescribed by a donor, cast away all the conditions and enjoy the gift simply?
Suppose that no lands at all had been sold; that the whole road had been built in fraud; not one contractor nor one day laborer paid, and that all the iron was got with some absolute and equal disregard of right. Has that which the General Government intended, been accomplished? Has the company under the act of Congress earned any lands at all? Do they not all belong to the United States? As we have seen, the lands were granted on 'restrictions, terms, and conditions,' and restrictions, terms, and conditions which follow the gift wherever it goes. If none of these conditions are performed, if no land has ever been sold, will the mere fact that rails are laidlaid as we have supposed in fraud of everybodyand that cars roll upon them, give the company a title to the lands under the act of Congress? Surely not.
Is the case altered by the fact that to secure a part of the debts contracted in building the road, you have pledged the lands, and that while the day laborer and the contractors, and the furnishers of iron and other materials have all been paid, the persons from whom you have borrowed money to pay them, are all left unpaid? Suppose that instead of borrowing money to pay the day laborers, contractors, and furnishers, you had left them unpaid and mortgaged the lands directly to them or to somebody in trust for them to secure a payment. Is your trust executed before a sale? It makes no difference in morals or in law who it is that is left unpaid, so long as anybody is left unpaid; the debt left unpaid being one contracted in making the road under the act of Congress. The case of Denniston v. Unknown Owners, in the Supreme Court of Wisconsin,13 a case on its facts closely like this one, expresses the true view. The court say:
'It must be presumed . . that the legislature intended so to dispose of these lands as to secure the completion of the work as soon as practicable, and also the payment of all lawful claims and demands against the improvement fund. In no other way could it fully discharge its obligation to the United States which it had assumed.'
A trust of the sort created in the present case, we may here remark, bears some analogy to a charitable use. In fact, gifts from the government for promoting works of public use are considered as gifts to charitable uses;14 and are to be administered by courts of equity on the principles on which such uses are habitually administered; that is to say, upon such rules of construction as will secure the most complete, pervading, and effectual execution of the trust, and in the sense most consistent with the honor, the purpose, and the interest of the donor; in this case the nation. Administering it thus, the court will administer it in a way that shall insure payment of all the company's debts contracted in constructing the road; whether the debts be for labor, materials, or money borrowed to procure them.
II. The act of May the general railroad law of that year15violated the obligation of contracts; violating at least two specifically made.
1. It violated one made by the twentieth section of the act of February 16 vesting the title to the lands in the Flint and P ere Marquette Company.
When that company was organized in all railroad companies were subject, under the general railroad act of to the specific tax of one per cent. on 'paid in' capital stock. The present road was built chiefly by land grant. The tax under the general railroad act would, of course, have been small. The State, regarding the land grant as a valuable gift, 'in consideration of the grant,' &c., imposed a greater specific tax than the general railroad law exacted. It imposed one per cent. on the cost of the road, &c., and reserved the right, after ten years, in its discretion, to add a further tax on gross receipts. Here was taxation, 'in consideration of the grant,' greatly in excess of existing, or prospective, taxation on other roads. But, because of this unequal burden, present and prospective, the State pledged itself that it should 'be in lieu'not of all other specific taxation, but in lieu of ALL other taxes within the State.17
There was, therefore, an agreement on consideration; in other words a contract, that the State would make no other taxes than the specific tax then laid. The general railroad act of in taxing lands within the State, violates the contract.
2. It violatesso far as relates to the taxes immediately in question, the taxes of another contract made by the thirty-seventh section of the act of April 18th, This act of April indeed, itself, so far as it undertook to tax our land grant at all, violated previous contracts of the State. However, we now speak only of the contract made in the thirty-seventh section. That section, after imposing an annual tax on gross receipts, declared it to be in lieu of all other taxes on the property of the company, whether real, personal, or mixed, except penalties, and 'except real property not necessary for carrying on the ordinary operations or franchises of their road.' Then, by a first and second proviso, lands opposite to, and coterminous with, the constructed portions of roads were promised exemption until after April 
Here, then, is a plain agreement not to tax these lands prior to April And this agreement was one on consideration; in other words it was a contract. What was the consideration? This plainly: The mortgage of had been executed, and the bonds which it secured by these lands were seeking a market, and the road through the lands here assessed was in a course of construction with the proceeds of these bonds. The only condition on which the bonds could be sold was that the security on the lands should be unimpaired. All men knew that if the lands were exposed to the dangerous and ever-increasing burden of local taxation, in a country where population and wealth were yet undeveloped, the bonds could not be sold. The legislature, of course, knew it. Hence, and in order to tempt investors to buy the bonds, in order to secure to the State of Michigan the benefits which the railroads would bring the State, it was promised that the security of the bondsthese landsshould be exempt from taxation until 1st April, 1874. On the faith of that promise the investors parted with their money, which act was an injury to them; and the road was constructed, afterwards, through the lands now in question, which act was a benefit to the State. Here is benefit to one side, and loss to the other. Certainly if a considerationa consideration in the fullest common-law sense of the word,can ever exist, one existed here. Now, confessedly the lands listed for taxation were not, in April, opposite to, and coterminous with, the line of road then in operation; and we insist that to tax them now under the acts of in that year, is a breach of a contract.
It is, however, but fair to the legislature, we think, to assume that, in subjecting the lands of the company to local taxation by the act of it did not intend to include the lands exempted by the thirty-seventh section of the act of Nothing in the act of repeals, in terms, the clauses of the act of now in view. The act of is general in its scope, and finds enough to operate on without seeking out these specially and temporarily exempted lands.
III. If there were no violation of a trust in the case, and if we had no special contract about anything, the constitution of the State, adopted in and before the organization of our company, makes the tax invalid. The bill alleges, and such is undeniably the fact, that prior to the adoption of this constitution, it had always been the practice of the State to collect specific taxes from railroad companies, and to collect no other. The clause of the constitution is thus:
'The State may continue to collect all specific taxes accruing to the treasury under existing laws. The legislature may provide for the collection of specific taxes from banking, railroad, plankroad, and other corporations hereafter created.'
This constitutional provision was evidently framed with a view to the continuation of that practice. Railroad corporations not having been subjected to local taxation, the framers of the constitution intended that they should not be.
Now, although this language is permissive in form, it is to be construed as mandatory in effectas a limitation upon the power of the legislature to impose taxes upon the corporations therein named, other than specific taxes: and for the obvious reason that if the language of the section is to be construed but as conferring a power on the legislature to be exercised at its discretion, the entire section might be obliterated from the constitution without changing the effect of that instrument. The power and the discretion as to its exercise would still remain in the legislature, under the general grant of legislative power.
Words of permission in statutes are frequently construed as obligatory. May, in a statute, means must, whenever third persons or the public have an interest in having the act done which is authorized by such permissive language.18 And the rules of interpretation of constitutions and of statutes are substantially the same, with this difference, however, that constitutional provisions are more rarely treated as directory than are statutory ones.19
Messrs. C. A. Kent and I. Marston, Attorney-General of Michigan, with whom was Mr. C. Upson, contra:
I. The great question in the first part of this case is, 'Has there been a sale of these lands by any one having authority to sell?'
If there has been such a sale, and if the proceeds have been applied exclusively to the construction of the road, there is an end of the case, so far as respects this part of it. The questions of violation of the specific contract and of the constitution of Michigan, remain of course for subsequent consideration.
Now, whatever may have been the nature of the transfer from the State to the Flint and P ere Marquette Railway Company, it will be conceded on the other side, that a valid conveyance by way of mortgage was made by the company to the complainant, Tucker; that the company, in consideration of the lands thus conveyed, did receive $ and that the company did apply that sum of money exclusively to the construction of the road, and to no other purpose; and that in consequence of the money so received and applied, the road is now a completed road, which the government of the United States and all persons may safely use in the way that the act of Congress intended.
Whether practically a mortgage is a lien, or whether it is a sale, depends generally upon the amount which the sum lent bears to the value of the land on which it is lent. When, for example, one lends $on land worth $ the mortgage is paid and is proved to have been a lien only. If, however, he lends $on the same property, the transaction generally reveals itself in its true legal character, that is to say, of a defeasible conveyance not defeated. One party, not the original owner of it, keeps the money, and the other, not the original owner of it, keeps the land. And this is the same thing exactly which occurs in an ordinary sale.
Further. It will be admitted, we suppose, that we are not engaged in inquiring whether, technically and by definitions given in text-books, &c., what has been done, apparently by way of mortgage, would come within the term 'sale.' It is enough if practically what was then done was, in consideration of the $ a final parting by the State, company, or trusteeswhichever you pleasewith the lands, and for about their money value, so that if the trustees executed their power of technical sale, little money would be got by them above the sum and interest due on the bonds.
Now this case comes here on bill and demurrer. A pleader is always held to have stated his own case as strongly as the case makes it possible for him to state it. And doubtless the complainant here so stated his case.
Yet, though it may be inferred from the statements of the bill filed here that the company has a right to the surplus, if any, that may remain from the sale of the lands after the bonds are paid, there is no averment that any surplus will remain; nor so much as a statement of the value of the lands mortgaged compared with the amount of the outstanding bonds, from which so much as an inference can be made on the subject. Neither directly, therefore, nor indirectly, is there any averment of a surplus. On the contrary, so far as things are stated, there will presumably be no surplus. The only lands specifically spoken of in the bill as mortgaged are
The lands in Osceola County, taxedacres, While of outstanding bonds there are still, $So far as the bill specifically shows a security, it shows one plainly inadequate to yield a surplus. If there were other lands mortgaged, their amount or value does not appear.
On the case, therefore, of the complainant, as shown by himself, the company has parted with the lands for their substantial value, or for more than such value.
With the lands thus practically sold, and the property of other peoplewith an equity of redemption in the company that amounts to a mere shadownothing can be less soundly argued than that they should be still exempt from taxation, as still belonging to the company.
The most that could be so argued would be that they should be exempted from taxation to the small degree of value which the equity of redemption bears to the interest conveyed or secured by mortgage.
Then again, and on the other hand, suppose that there will be a large surplus. What is the opposing argument? This only, that there should be no debts left unpaid. But all workmen and all contractors, and all persons furnishing work or equipments to the road have confessedly been paid. And if the persons who have lent the money to pay them are made abundantly secure by the mortgage, what harm has been done, or can occur to any one?
The purpose of the United States was that the road should be made; that so much of the land as was necessary to make it should be applied to making it; that any surplus should belong to the company. An application of the necessary portion of the land through a process of sale, was, no doubt, the process contemplated for getting the money. But the process through which the application of the land was to be made, was a modal matter simply, not one of essence. Any surplus of the land, as we have said, after an application of enough of it to get the requisite amount of money to make the road, belonged to the company; and, whether that surplus remained in the form of an equity of redemption, or in the form of a part of the lands clear of any mortgage, was of no importance to the United States; and, indeed, concerned nobody but the company. As things now stand, the road is built, it is paid for, it is paid for out of the land. The conscience of the company, it seems, is exercised because the bondholders who have lent money on the faith of the mortgage are not paid off. But they hold the land; and they can compel a sale of it if they are not paid. Suppose they lose, that is to say, suppose they have given more for the bonds than they are worth; more than the land secures. They are no worse off than if for the same money they had bought the land at a sale of it; nor as badly off, since the company is bound on the bonds. If the land is worth greatly more than the amount which it secures, and the company, in the face of its own interests, suffers the bondholders to take it, wherein does the company stand worse off than if for the amount borrowed, it had sacrificed the land on a sale?
The matter, as we have said, concerns the question of surplus only; and the surplus concerns no one but the company. If the bonds are paid without any sale, and satisfaction entered on the mortgage, then all is well, for all has ended well.
Thus far we have contemplated the matter in a point of view not technical; in a point of view such as men of plain and practical sense would take.
But if we need come to technical rules, technical rules declare that the mortgage was a sale. The whole purpose of the grant by the United States was to raise money to build the road. The power to sell was given only to do this thing. But it is well settled that a power of sale to raise money is well executed by the creation of a mortgage for that purpose.20
So far as any interest in the United States is concerneda matter much pressed in the points taken, and on the argument in the court below, and in the briefs; but which, since the case of Railroad Company v. McShane, just now decided in this court,21 and qualifying and restraining the operation of Railway Company v. Prescott,22 and since the completion of the road, is feebly pressed in the oral argument here,the United States are the only party who could complain therefor. The case of Baker v. Gee23 is in point.
II. The State of Michigan has not entered into any contract with the Flint and P ere Marquette Company, or with complainants, which forbids the proposed taxation.
The power of taxation is an attribute of sovereignty and essential to every independent government. It is well settled that an intention to exempt private property from taxation by legislative contract will never be inferred except from the clearest language. There is no safety in any other rule.24
And it is of the essence of such contract, as it is of every other contract, that it have a consideration.25 Privileges which are granted by the State without any agreement as to their continuance, and without the passing of any consideration from the grantees, may be withdrawn at any time. To the claim of exemption founded on the twentieth section of the act of there are two answers.
(a) The section, by its terms, refers only to taxation upon the cost of the road and its equipments, and to taxation of the gross receipts, and the limitation in the last clause must be referred only to the taxation previously mentioned. There is here no reference to the taxation of the lands in question.
It is settled that laws which provide for the exemption or the specific taxation of corporations, though in terms including their entire property, will be construed to extend only to property which is needed in the performance of the public duties of the corporation, and that it does not include that held for general investment or profit.27
The settled tendency of all the courts is to a narrow construction of all exemptions from taxation.
(b) Section twenty was repealed by the legislature of and the taxation of the land-grant railroads was made uniform with that of other railroads, under the general railroad law of which provided for a tax of one per cent. upon the capital stock paid in of any company.28
This change diminished the rate of taxation upon the Flint and P ere Marquette Company, and they assented to it by paying the lesser taxes. Hence they can claim no rights under the law thus repealed. If it be said that that enactment putting this company under the tax as laid by the general railroad law of was substituted for section twenty, as a part of the contract, the answer is that the general railroad law of was in every section of it made amendable or repealable at any time by the constitution of Michigan,29 and that the tax provided in the law of has been changed by the act of and the company has paid its tax for the year in accordance with this last law.
(c) Section seven of the same act30 of under which the exemption is claimed, is inconsistent with the construction sought to be put by the complainant upon section twenty. The inference, from the existence in the act of section seven, is irresistible, that section twenty was not supposed to make any provision as to the taxation of these lands, and that by providing that they should not be taxed for seven years both parties supposed them taxable after the seven years had expired.
2. To the allegation that the general railroad law of which provided a specific rate of taxation, constituted a contract between the State and the companies that no other tax would be laid, it is enough to say that no consideration was ever given by the company for the alleged contract, and the provision was in 'general law,' which is expressly made subject to amendment or repeal, at the pleasure of the legislature. At the most the provisions relied on were but grants of privileges, which could be withdrawn at any time.
III. The taxation is not in conflict with the constitution of Michigan.
To the position, that it is so, there are at least two sufficient replies:
1. The specific taxes which may be imposed upon corporations, cover only such property as is used in the prosecution of the purpose for which the corporation is organized. This we have already said, citing some authorities, in commenting on the claim for exemption set up under the twentieth section of the act of A comparison of the clause of the constitution of Michigan relied on shows that the word 'may' does not, in the clause relied on, mean 'shall.'
Indeed, we submit that the word 'may' does mean 'shall,' only when some officer has been given an authority which, under certain circumstances, it is his duty to protect.
Reply:
I. It is plainly inferable from the statements of the bill that before the road was made, the lands were mortgaged to pay bonds sold in order to make it; that a power to sell the lands and redeem the bonds accompanied the mortgage; that since the bonds were issued the road has been made or is a making; that a portion of the bonds have been taken up by a sale of the lands, and that this process is now going on. This shows that the lands are worth more than they are mortgaged for; and it stands to reason, that lands which were valuable enough, before the road was made, to tempt capitalists to advance money on them, are now more valuable since the road has been actually made, and the amount of the debt reduced by the cancellation of some of the bonds issued in order to make it.
II. We admit that the power of taxation is an essential one to every government, and that anybody claiming an exemption from it under statute must show an intention expressed in unambiguous terms; that a consideration is of the essence of every contract, &c., &c. But of what pertinence in this case is the enunciation of such general and universally admitted truths; it being perfectly settled that contracts to exempt, when expressed with any such plainness as shows their meaning, and when resting on a sufficient consideration are valid, and to be enforced?32 The only inquiry pertinent is, does the language of the statutes in this case, plainly show a purpose to confine the taxation in the way which we allege, and was there a consideration here? And we refer to the language itself, of the different acts, as a conclusive argument to show that the statutes do clearly show such purpose, and to the facts of the case, to show that they rest on considerations both pecuniarily valuable and having strongest foundation in policy and honor.
While, however, we admit that a consideration is necessary to make a binding contract even on a State, we cannot but recognize some distinction between individuals, who can be summoned by any one before the courts of the country when it is alleged that they have broken their contracts, and States, which by individuals, at least, cannot be; and we respond reluctantly to the position that a State of this Union can violate a promise, deliberately made by it, published on its statute-book, enrolled in its capitol, and sent forth to the nations, on the groundthat no 'consideration' was received by it for what it did.
It is argued
(a) That by the settled rules of construction the general words at the conclusion of section twenty, that the 'said above several taxes shall be in lieu of all other taxes to be imposed within this State,' are to be referred to the 'specific annual tax, one per cent., &c.,' then laid, and that the right is reserved to make a further tax on gross earnings, spoken of in the previous part of the section, and that only such specific taxes are meant to be referred to.
The argument in the face of the words which we have italicized is incomprehensible. Is the tax laid on these lands a tax not specific, and is it imposed within the State of Michigan? Certainly it is both. Then it is void, for the State has contracted that a specific tax laid in another act shall be 'in lieu of all such taxes.' No rule of construction will infer a contrary effect in the case of such words as these, for no rule of construction will allow us to disregard the meaning of words when the meaning is clear.
It is said that laws which provide for the exemption or for the specific taxation of property, whish include their entire property, will be construed to extend 'only to property which is used in the performance of the public duties of the corporation, and that it does not include that held for general investment or profit.' And the inference is supposed to follow, that the contract of the twentieth section to exempt from all but specific taxes does not apply to these lands. Concede the rule to be true, yet the inference supposed to follow does not follow; for the application of it to these lands would be a misapplication of it.
The lands are not held by the railway company for any purpose of use in connection with the running of its road, or the exercise of its ordinary business. Neither are they held for general purposes of investment or profit. They were the gift of Congress to build the road; the substance out of which the road is a making. They constitute a part of the capital stock, taking the place, and doing the work, which the money paid in by shareholders does in ordinary railway enterprises.33 Lands held by railway companies for investment or profit, or for purposes merely convenient to the business of their roads, are purchased out of the capital stock or other assets, and held incidentally to the main business. And as to these, questions of taxation properly arise. But the lands in question, standing in place of the paid-in stock, are in no sense of that class. They are as much property exempt as the paid-in stock, or the road bed, rails, and rolling stock which they are pledged to pay for. It is directly out of their pledge and sale that the road exists, that its business is prosecuted, and that it earns the money to pay its specific tax.
It is further argued
(b) That section twenty of the act of was repealed by an act of and a less rate of taxation established, to which rate the company assented; and that the act of was not a contract.
But these amendments relaxing the provisions of section twenty, were made at the instance of and for the benefit of the company. Of course, legislation made in such circumstances does not raise an inference that there was a change of contract, or that the legislature had any right to change the contract to the prejudice or against the interests of the company.
The general railroad act of was in truth the first attempt of the legislature to impair the obligation of the contract made in the twentieth section, and the company has resisted it from the first.
It is argued next
(c) That because the seventh section of the act of exempts the lands from taxation for seven years, the implication is irresistible that after the seven years had expired they might be taxed; and, therefore, that we misconstrue the twentieth section of the act.
The argument is plausible, but it is refuted by the fact that this seventh section is followed by another section, the nineteenth, which provides that the whole of the railroad is to be completed within seven years. The two sections are to be construed in connection with each other. The assumption of the legislature was that the road would be completed within seven years (the nineteenth section being a mandate to that effect), and the seventh section holding out a promise that if persons would invest capital in the road, then, inasmuch as the road was to be built in seven years, that the land should not be taxed during that time. So far from being evidence of a purpose not to make a contract of that kind, it is evidence that the legislature held out that the land would not be subject to taxation until after the trust had been executed, and until after the land had done the proposed work and passed into private ownership.
This seventh section, it is to be observed, provides that nothing in the act shall be so construed as to relinquish the right of the State to any specific taxes. This shows that the legislature thought the provision about the lands made an irrevocable contract. Why else reserve the right to impose specific taxes?
2. A clause in the constitution of Michigan is invoked. The clause authorizes corporations to be formed under general law, and forbids their creation by specific act except for municipal purposes. It adds:
'All laws passed pursuant to this section may be amended, altered, or repealed.'
Now, what laws may be passed pursuant to that section? Obviously, general laws under which corporations may be formed, or special acts for municipal purposes. But the act of February, (the contract act), is neither a general law forming a corporation, nor a special act for municipal purposes. Therefore, it is not a law 'passed pursuant to this section,' and hence not a law which may be amended, altered, or repealed under the clause of the constitution relied on.
III. The specific taxes which the constitution allows the continuance of in the case of railroad corporations cover, it is saidjust as was said in regard to statutesonly the property used in the prosecution of the purpose for which the road is organized.
But the bill alleges, and the demurrer admits it to be true, that prior to the adoption of that constitution 'the property of railway corporations had never been taxed by local assessment, nor otherwise than by specific taxation;' and these taxes and these alone, it seems to be admitted by the opposite counsel, the State may lay; the position being only that the clause does not apply to lands like those of the land grant. But if 'the property' of railway corporations had never been assessed otherwise than by specific taxation, and only such taxation may be continued, surely the lands cannot be taxed. They are 'the property' of railroad corporations exactly, and fully as much as the railroad bed itself; and in common comprehension, as being more external to the corporation, even more so.
Mr. Justice SWAYNE, having referred to the statutes and recapitulated the facts bearing on the case, delivered the opinion of the court.
The appellants have assigned in this court various errors.34
We shall consider the several propositions which they state without specifically enumerating them.
The United States granted the lands to the State for a specific purpose. That purpose was 'to aid in the construction of railroads' upon the routes designated. The land was made 'subject to the disposal of the legislature for the purpose aforesaid, and no other.' Congress prescribed certain safeguards to secure their application to the construction of the roads, and to prevent failure or diversion. The precautions were few and simple. Except as to the first one hundred and twenty sections, the power of sale was to attach only as the road was completed in successive sections of twenty miles each. Subsequently the extent of the sections and the quantity of land were reduced one-half. If the entire road was not completed within the time limited, no further sales were to be made, and all the unsold land was to revert to the United States. Subsequently the reverter was limited to the lands to which the right to sell had not attached. In other words, it was confined to those where the title was inchoate only, and had no application to those where the title was complete. As to those of the former class, there was not, when the bill was filed, and is not now, any default. If the fact were otherwise, it would be for the United States, by office found, or other proper proceeding, to assert their rights. But they do not complain, and the complainants cannot do it vicariously for them.35 It is a conclusive answer to the proposition we are considering that the United States have no more claim, legal or equitable, touching the lands here in question than they have to lands which they have sold and patented to others in the regular course of the administration of the land department of the government; and that Congress has not seen fit, either expressly or by implication, to impose any restriction upon the taxing power of the State. That subject was remitted, as, under the circumstances, it might well be, wholly to her wisdom and discretion.
The State accepted the grant subject to all the conditions prescribed. She thereupon became the agent and trustee of the United States. The powers and duties with which she was clothed might all have been discharged by private individuals. The characters of sovereign and trustee were united in the same party. The State did not in any wise abdicate her sovereignty by accepting the trust, but the former might be exercised to render more effectual the discharge of the latter. She was in no wise fettered, except as she had agreed to fulfill all the terms and conditions which accompanied the grant. To that extent she was clearly bound, and anything in conflict with those conditions would be ultra vires and cannot be supported. What were the terms to which she submitted herself? She was to devote the lands to the accomplishment of the object which Congress had in view, and there was an implied agreement on her part to take all the measures reasonably within her power to make their application effectual to that end. The mode was left entirely to herself. We see no ground upon which it can be claimed she bound herself any further. Upon general principles she could not tax the land while the title remained in the United States, nor while she held them as the trustee of the United States, which, in the view of the law, was the same thing. But when the State, proceeding in the execution of the trust, had transferred her entire title to the company, and they had perfected their title and acquired the right to sell, the case assumed a very different aspect.
The validity of the mortgages is not drawn in question, and is too clear to be doubted. We need not, therefore, consider that subject. When the mortgages were executed the complainants took the legal title, so far as the company held by that title, and the equitable or inchoate title of the company to the residue of the lands. Copies of the mortgages are not attached to the bill, and we are not advised particularly of their contents. If they contain a covenant of warranty, the legal title, as fast as it was acquired by the company, inured to the mortgagees.36
If there was no warranty, and the land, and not the title, of the company was conveyed, the company is barred by estoppel from setting up the after-acquired title, and the estoppel runs with the land. The result is the same as if there had been a warranty.37
When the grant was made by the State to the company, the entire title before held by the former passed to the latter. Nothing remained to the State but the performance of the remaining duties of the trust, without any title, present or potential, to the lands.
Forbearance to tax was a bounty voluntarily given by the State. Forbearance for a time doubtless increased to some extent the value of the lands. Never to tax would have increased their value still more.38 There is no foundation for a claim for one more than for the other. The State, in the act accepting the grant, agreed su a sponte, to forbear to tax for seven years. There is no complaint that this stipulation has been violated. Any obligation, legal or equitable, to do more in this way is wanting.
The company, so far as the matter of right is concerned, were upon a footing with all other alienees of the United States. The imposition of taxes can in no just sense be said to be a diminution of the value of the lands.39 If Congress had thought so, they would have forbidden it. Liability to taxation is an incident to all real estate. Exemption is an exception. When claimed, to be effectual it must be clearly made out.
The proposition founded upon the twentieth section of the act of the legislature of the 14th of February, is unsound. There are several answers. We shall state but one of them. That section imposes a tax with reference to the railroad itself. It has no relation to the lands owned by the company not used nor necessary in operating the road. The lands of the class of those here in question doubtless were not present to the mind of the legislature when that section was framed. The language employed cannot receive the comprehensive construction contended for.40 The subject of taxing the lands of the company had already been dealt with. The seventh section of the act provided that they should not be taxed for seven years from the 1st of September, 1857. It would have been a solecism to exempt them for seven years and in the same act to exempt them without limit of time. Our view gives harmony and symmetry to the two provisions. Where such an exemption is claimed, the language from which it is alleged to arise is always to be strictly construed.
This provision for exemption was by the clearest implication an assertion by the State in limine of the power to tax. The subsequent exemption involves the like claim.
The provision of the thirty-seventh section of the act of exempting the lands specified from local taxation until three years from the 1st of April, which period has not elapsed, was not a contract. There was no consideration. The company was required to do nothing, and did nothing in return. As between individuals the stipulation would belong to the category of nude pacts. It has no higher character because one of the parties was a State, the other a corporation, and it was put in the form of a statute. It was the promise of a gratuity spontaneously made, which might be kept, changed, or recalled at pleasure. The case of Christ Church Hospital v. The County of Philadelphia41 is instructive upon this subject. In the legislature of Pennsylvania passed an act declaring 'that the real property, including ground-rents, now belonging to Christ Church Hospital, in the city of Philadelphia, so long as the same shall continue to belong to said hospital, shall be and remain free from taxes.' In a law was passed which subjected the ground-rents to taxation. The Supreme Court of the State sustained the validity of the latter act. The hospital removed the case, by a writ of error under the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act of to this court. Here it was insisted that the act of was a contract in perpetuity, and the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States was invoked for its protection. This court unanimously affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of the State.
The taxing power is vital to the functions of government. It helps to sustain the social compact and to give it efficacy. It is intended to promote the general welfare. It reaches the interests of every member of the community. It may be restrained by contract in special cases for the public good, where such contracts are not forbidden. But the contract must be shown to exist. There is no presumption in its favor. Every reasonable doubt should be resolved against it. Where it exists it is to be rigidly scrutinized, and never permitted to extend, either in scope or duration, beyond what the terms of the concession clearly require. It is in derogation of public right, and narrows a trust created for the good of all.42

Providence Bank v. Billings, Philadelphia Railroad Co. v. Maryland, Jefferson Branch v. Skelly, Delaware Railroad Tax, 
Whether under the constitution of Michigan the State can impose taxes other than those which are specific upon the Flint and P ere Marquette Company, is a question which in this case does not arise. The taxes involved in this controversy were not to be upon the corporation, nor upon property used in the exercise of its franchises, but upon lands which it had mortgaged and was holding for sale. The distinction and the consequences have been considered. We need say nothing further upon the subject.
We think the demurrer was necessarily sustained, and the bill properly dismissed.
DECREE AFFIRMED.
