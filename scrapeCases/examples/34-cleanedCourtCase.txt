INTEROCEAN OIL CO.
v.
UNITED STATES.
Argued and Submitted Jan. 12, 1926.
1
This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims entered May 26, 1924, sustaining a demurrer filed by the United States, and dismissing the petition upon the ground that it does not state a cause of action. The facts stated in the petition are as follows:
1
2
The appellant, the Interocean Oil Company, was in 1918 and before, engaged in refining, transporting and dealing in petroleum and petroleum products, chiefly fuel oil, at Carteret, N. J., where it owned and operated a refinery and storage tanks. It also had a refinery at Baltimore, Md. During the War, the corporation was represented in Baltimore by Harold F. Brown in the sale of oil to the Shipping Board and the United States Navy. Brown made arrangements with Maj. Ross of the Quartermaster's Department of the United States Army, acting under the direction of Col. Kimball, in charge, for the purchase by that department of fuel oil for army transports. After experiments made under the direction of Maj. Ross, a satisfactory grade of fuel oil was obtained by mixing the heavy gravity oil of this oil company with the light gravity oil of the Standard Oil Company. Maj. Ross then directed Brown to be prepared to furnish the full quantity of fuel oil required by the Quartermaster's Department. Ross complained that there was not enough storage for fuel oil at Baltimore. Brown advised him that the steel plates with which to erect the tanks could not be obtained on account of the War. Ross, finding that the company owned storage facilities at Carteret, demanded that they be removed to Baltimore. In a conversation in April, 1918, Ross advised the officers of the company that the Quartermaster's Department was short of fuel oil and that there must be additional tankage, and that unless the tankage at Carteret was removed to Baltimore, the department would seize it and remove it itself as an exigency of war, but that, if the claimant was willing itself to transfer the tanks, it would be satisfactory to the department, and that all expense incurred and all losses sustained would be paid by the government. The company's officers advised Ross that the removal of the tanks would mean the destruction of its business at New York, but Ross said it would be compensated for all its loss and damage and that failure to remove the tanks would result in the department itself doing the work. The officers of the company were convinced that Ross was acting within the scope of his authority, because theretofore when he had given verbal orders to Brown for fuel oil, they had always been followed in due time by confirmatory written orders, and thereafter prompt payment had been made for the oil purchased. Indeed so accustomed was Brown to this that he had complied without question with every order, depending upon the future confirmation of it. In respect to the movement of the tanks, Ross said that he was authorized to act for the War Department, and that written official confirmation thereof would be forthcoming from that Department. When Ross' attention was called to the fact that these confirmatory orders had not come, he said it was an oversight and promised they would be forthcoming at once from Col. Kimball. Later he said he had made out the orders and delivered them to Col. Kimball, who would sign them as evidence that proper official authority was being exercised. They were never signed or delivered, however, and Col. Kimball left the service and went abroad because of ill health, and later died. The removal of the tanks was begun by the company with all dispatch, and it was far advanced when the Armistice was signed November 11, 1918. This made their use unnecessary for the purpose of the War Department. They were not re-erected and in condition for use at Baltimore until February, 1919.
2
3
The petition averred that the removal of the tanks from Carteret resulted in the claimant's losing its right to re-erect them at Carteret because of action of the Legislature of New Jersey and the local authorities. The items of damage included the actual expense incurred in taking down the plant at Carteret and its freight to Baltimore, and its re-erection there, which amounted to about $ The claim made also included an item for the depreciation in the plant at Carteret of $and one for the loss of franchise to conduct business at Carteret and the profit on the probable sales of oil at Carteret for five years from April, 1918, to October, 1923, which was put at $.
3
4
It is contended on behalf of the claimant that the government got the benefit of the contract made between Ross and it, that it had the right to rely on Ross' authority, and that performance of the contract saved the necessity of a written agreement as required by Rev. St. § . The petition set forth no facts upon which the United States can be said to have made any contract, whether oral or written, with the claimant company. There is no averment that Maj. Ross was authorized to make the contract upon which suit is brought. The averments are only that Ross told the officers of the company that he had the authority to make the contract, and that there would be a written confirmation by his chief, Col. Kimball. It is expressly admitted that no such written confirmation by Col. Kimball was ever signed or delivered to the company. The necessary effect of the lengthy averments of the petition is that Ross did not have authority to make a contract for the government such as that sued on, but that the authority was vested in Col. Kimball and that until Col. Kimball signed the contract, it did not bind the government. All the statements of the petition united together are no more than to say that the company relied on the promise of Maj. Ross that Col. Kimball would confirm the contract which Ross proposed to make and said that he had authority subject to Kimball's confirmation to make. But Kimball never confirmed it.
4
5
Nor is there any implied contract binding upon the government. The Oil Company was dealing with its own property in moving it from Carteret to Baltimore, and when the tanks were removed to Baltimore, they still belonged to the company for use by it not only in storing oil for the government but for any one else. There was no enrichment of the government to its knowledge, no benefit in the form of property given to it or of service rendered to it from which the contract by it to pay could be implied. The Court of Claims was right in sustaining the demurrer, and the judgment is

Affirmed.

270 U.S. 124
UNITED STATES
v.
SWIFT & CO. SWIFT & CO. v. UNITED STATES.
Submitted Nov. 24, 1925.
1
This is a suit to recover damages for the loss caused to Swift & Co. by the refusal of the United States to accept a quantity of finished and unfinished army bacon ordered by competent authority for delivery in March, 1919. They only ground for not accepting it was that the need had been removed by the unexpected rapidity of demobilization. The claim was first presented to the War Department under the Act of March known as the Dent Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. e). It was denied by the Board of Contract Adjustment of the War Department, on the ground that the agreement under which the bacon was produced was not concluded until after November, 1918; the Dent Act applying only to agreements entered into prior to that date. The Secretary of War affirmed this decision. The petition in the Court of Claims alleged that the liability of the government was lawfully established by a written contract properly signed and executed, binding the United States.
1
2
The Court of Claims found that the contract was entered into in due and regular form, and could be enforced under the general jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, and that, even if there were defects in the contract, as the contract had been fully performed in accord with the terms of the contract as subsequently modified by the parties, the alleged defects were immaterial. It accordingly gave judgment for $ being the difference between the contract price for the bacon ready for delivery in accordance with the contract and the proceeds of its sale. In addition to this amount, Swift & Co. sought damages in the amount of $for more than pounds of salted bellies, which had been cured, but had not been smoked and made into bacon, and which were on hand at the time the contract was canceled. A large part of these were sold in France at a very large reduction. The Court of Claims held that, by attempting to sell this material abroad, Swift & Co. had taken a speculative course, and could not hold the government for the difference between the contract price and the proceeds of sale. Swift & Co. filed a cross-appeal on this issue, and that is before us.
2
3
The government in the Court of Claims set up a counterclaim against Swift & Co. for $ made up of alleged improper and illegal charges presented by the plaintiff to the defendant on account of army bacon delivered from September, 1918, to February, 1919, which were paid by the government by mistake to Swift & Co. in the settlement of bills and accounts so presented. The Court of Claims found that it was not shown to the satisfaction of the court that any improper or illegal charges had been made or paid by mistake, or that any misrepresentation or concealment was practiced by Swift & Co., to the detriment of the government in the settlement. The government appealed from this rejection of the counterclaim, but does not press its appeal.

The correspondence upon which Swift & Co. asserts the existence of a valid contract in writing before the parties is contained in the sixteenth finding of the Court of Claims:

71
Upon receiving these orders, Swift & Co. directed its buyers to buy hogs. From that time on purchases were conducted daily so that suitable bellies were prepared for January and February deliveries, and on January 13, 1919, the first bellies were put in cure for March, 1919, delivery.
71
72
The objections by the government to the documents submitted on behalf of Swift & Co. as written evidence of a contract are, first, that government officers conducting the correspondence had no authority to make it; second, that the documents do not contain the necessary terms to constitute a contract, in that they do not show the place for the performance of the contract, and do not fix the price of the bacon to be delivered; third, they do not show a real agreement between the parties, but were merely preliminary negotiations and were never merged in a written contract; and, fourth, that they do not comply with Revised Statutes, § in the form of contract required in such cases.
72
73
First. The officers whose names are attached to the papers on behalf of the government are Brig. Gen. A. D. Kniskern, Brigadier General Quartermaster Corps, and Maj. E. L. Roy, Quartermaster Corps, assigned to temporary duty with the Food Administration.
73
74
The finding of the Court of Claims in respect to Gen. Kniskern's authority is as follows:
74
75
'The furnishing of adequate meat supplies for the army was within the authority and duty of the Acting Quartermaster General and afterwards within his authority and duty as Director of Purchase and Storage. Gen. Kniskern, as depot quartermaster at Chicago, was the authorized representative of the Acting Quartermaster General in the purchase of meat supplies, and, while subject to any specific instructions which the Acting Quartermaster General might see fit to give him, his duty was to supply the needs, and specific authority as to each purchase was not required. There was in the office of the Quartermaster General a subsistence division, but the chief duty it exercised in the matter of the purchase of meats was to supply Gen. Kniskern with such information as might be available as to future needs, leaving it to him to supply them. The authority of Gen. Kniskern in connection with the establishing in Chicago of a packing house products branch of the subsistence division of the Quartermaster General's Office and in connection with his later appointment as zone supply officer appears in finding V and VI.
75
76
'V.
76
77
'On July 3, 1918, by Office Order No. Quartermaster General's Office, there was established in Chicago a packing house products branch of the subsistence division of the Quartermaster General's Office, to be located in the general supply depot of the Quartermaster Corps at Chicago, to be under th immediate direction and control of the depot quartermaster, and to be responsible for all matters pertaining to the procurement, production, and inspection of packing house products, subject to the control of the Quartermaster General.
77
78
'The interpretation of this order by the then Acting Quartermaster General was 'that whereas the purchasing of supplies was concentrated in Washington, that Chicago being the food market, we delegated to Gen. Kniskern the purchase of meat products and articles of that kind.'
78
79
'VI.
79
80
'On October 28, 1918, by Purchase and Storage Notice No. 21, issued by Brig. Gen. R. E. Wood, as Director of Purchase and Storage, supply zones were created and by said order the Director of Purchase and Storage appointed 'as his representative in each general procurement zone the present depot quartermaster to act and be known as the zone supply officer,' who was 'charged with authority over and responsibility for supply activities within the zone under his jurisdiction.' 'This form of organization in effect transferred the field organization of the Quartermaster Corps to the office of the Director of Purchase and Storage. The procurement divisions which had theretofore existed in the Quartermaster Corps were transferred to the supply zones created in the purchase and storage organization, these zones being practically the same as those formerly existing in the Quartermaster Corps, over each of which the proper depot quartermaster exercised jurisdiction, and the depot quartermasters of the Quartermaster Corps became zone supply officers and representatives, as such, of the Director of Purchase and Storage.
80
81
'Existing orders and regulations of the several supply corps with respect to supply activities transferred to the Director of Purchase and Storage were continued in effect, 'providing that the zone supply officers constituted by the notice shall have final authority in their respective zones over all matters referred to in existing orders and regulations."
81
82
The Food Administration under the President early in 1918 found that the demand for food commodities was greater than their supply, and it was necessary to suspend the law of supply and demand in respect to their prices, and that large purchases of certain commodities should be made by allocations at fair prices. A Food Purchase Board was formally organized by the President, which, on July 16, 1918, required that canned meats and bacon should be placed on an allotment basis. Gen. Kniskern, as depot quartermaster at Chicago, was notified by the Quartermaster General that thereafter tin bacon and smoked bacon would be allocated by the Food Administration, and he was requested to cancel orders which had been placed with the packers, and ask allotments of the same from the Food Administration. He accordingly in August 1918 canceled the orders for the next four months, but wrote the Food Administration, requesting that they confirm the allotments made in accordance with his orders. Thereupon Maj. Roy of the Quartermaster's Department, in the name of the Food Administration, made the allotments. This arrangement continued until the Food Administration gave up its activities, after the Armistice.
82
83
On December 16, 1918, Gen. Kniskern was instructed by Telegraph as follows:
83
84
'December .
84
85
'Effective with January requirements, the Army will purchase packing-house products independently of Food Administration.
85
86
'This office is notifying Food Administration accordingly. You are authorized to proceed on this basis. Please wire acknowledgment.
86
87
Wood, Subsistence, Baker.'
87
88
Thereafter prices for January and February deliveries were determined as they had been during the early months of before that function came to be exercised by the Food Administration. The course of procedure with reference to giving the orders for bacon and the fixing of the price therefor is shown in the following finding:
88
89
'IX.
89
90
'In supplying the needs of the army for bacon and other packing house products during the early stages of the war, the regular method of advertising for and receiving bids and letting contracts to lowest bidders, if otherwise satisfactory, was adhered to, but later on, in 1917 and during the needs had so grown and were so rapidly approaching the capacity of the packing plants that this method became impracticable, and the necessity for a constant and ever-increasing flow of supplies of this character made necessary the resort to other purchase and procurement methods.
90
91
'The office of the depot quartermaster, afterward the zone supply officer, at Chicago was informed from time to time by the proper authorities at Washington as to the number of men which would be in the service within stated times, and the duty devolved on the depot quartermaster of procuring supplies of the kind in question sufficient for the indicated number of men without the issuance of specific authorization to him in each instance to purchase or specific instructions as to quantities to be purchased. And because of the time required to cure, smoke and can army bacon, it was necessary to anticipate needs therefor.
91
92
'The plan was adopted by the depot quartermaster at Chicago of calling into conference with him or his authorized assistant, from time to time, representatives of this plaintiff and the six other large packing houses, at which conferences the packers' representatives were informed formed as to the needs of the government for a stated period, usually three months, sufficiently in the future to give time for manufacture, and asked to indicate what portion of the stated needs each would furnish. Upon receipt of the statements from the packers as to what quantities they would furnish, which were submitted in writing and usually within a few days after the conference, the depot quartermaster made an allotment to each packer and notified each as to the quantities it would be expected to furnish during each month of the period involved.'
92
93
It is quite evident from the findings that in the organization and reorganization of the many agencies needed to furnish the supplies of food in Chicago, there were apparent conflicts of jurisdiction and there were orders issued having on their face general application which in fact by the course of business were limited, and all these orders from the War Department and from the Quartermaster's Department were before the Court of Claims for its consideration. In such a situation the finding of the Court of Claims that Gen. Kniskern was the representative of the Quartermastr's Department in making these contracts for bacon is either a question of fact or a mixed question of law and fact, and is conclusive on this court. United States v. Omaha Tribe of Indians, L. Ed. 901; Ross v. Day, and cases cited. There is nothing whatever in the other findings which is inconsistent with this. At the time this order was given and accepted by Swift & Co. in November, 1918, the Food Administration, by direction of the President, had the authority and duty to act upon the needs of the Quartermaster General's Department for bacon and other food supplies and to approve those orders and allot them to the packing companies who were to deliver the supplies. When, therefore, the accepted orders had been signed both by Gen. Kniskern and by Maj. Roy for the Food Administration, they were certainly authorized in writing on behalf of the government.
93
94
Gen. Kniskern's authority to act in these purchase is questioned on the ground that a Capt. Shugert was the only officer authorized to make such contracts. The objection cannot be sustained. On September 17, 1918, Capt. Jay C. Shugert, Quartermaster Corps, was, by authority of the Acting Quartermaster General, designated as purchasing and contracting officer for the packing house products and produce division of the office of the depot quartermaster at Chicago. This order to Shugert did not vest him with any authority to make contracts for the packing products branch of the subsistence division of the Quartermaster General's office. Before this latter branch was established there was a packing house products and produce division of the depot quartermaster's office at Chicago to which Shugert was attached. There two offices were distinct. The former was a unit of the Quartermaster General's office located at Chicago under the immediate direction and control of the depot quartermaster, with general authority to purchase packing house products for the whole army of the United States wherever situated, as shown by the findings. The latter was a unit in the depot quartermaster's office at Chicago and by an order of January 9, 1919, its functions were transferred to a newly organized office of Director of Purchase and Storage, and Capt. Shugert was transferred with it and thereafter signed the so-called formal contracts of January and February. More than this, even if Capt. Shugert had been a purchasing and contracting officer with authority to sign this main contract of November, 1918, it would not have deprived Gen. Kniskern of such power when his authority had been recognized and exercised in the purchase of many millions of pounds of bacon for the government for many months.
94
95
Second. The next objection is that the alleged contract is not complete in its terms, first in that the offers made by Swift & Co. included No. 8 bacon, while the order of the Food Administration and of Gen. Kniskern included nothing but No. 10 bacon. We find no weight in this suggestion. The offer was made by Swift & Co., and it was only accepted by the allotment of the Food Administration to the extent of No. 10 bacon and that allotment was accepted in writing by Swift & Co., which, of course, eliminated bacon No. 8 from the contract.
95
96
Then it is said that in the letter of December 10th an inquiry was made by Gen. Kniskern for information as to where the allotments were to be put up. This was not a term of the contract. It was evidently left to the discretion of Swift & Co. to distribute the allotments as might be convenient to it, and the inquiry was only for information as to the various plants of Swift & Co. at which inspections and deliveries were to be made.
96
97
Then it is said that there was no complete contract because the price was not fixed. Upon this point finding No. 10 of the Court of Claims is important. It is as follows:
97
98
'Since there were many elements entering into cost of production as to which there were frequent fluctuations, it was not practicable to undertake to determine prices so far in advance, and accordingly, instead of fixing prices at the time the proposals were submitted, or notices of allotments issued, it was agreed that prices would be determined at or near the first of each month for the product to be furnished during that month. This was at a time when of necessity the preparation of the product, in this instance bacon, was well under way, approaching completion as to a large part thereof and when the cost of the green bellies, the basic element of final cost, and other fluctuating elements of cost were ascertainable.
98
99
'At about this time the usual form of circular proposals were sent to the packers, not for use in submitting bids as under the peacetime competitive system, but as a convenient method for formal submission by the packers of their proposals as to price for the product which they had theretofore been directed to furnish during the month in question and which already, by direction of the depot quartermaster, was in process of preparation.
99
'Upon submission of these proposals as to price, if the same were satisfactory to the depot quartermaster or, otherwise, upon adjustment to a satisfactory basis, purchase orders were issued, which furnished the basis of payment, although the purchase orders frequently were not issued until a part and sometimes all of the product covered thereby had been delivered.'

It was evidently impossible to make a contract fixing the price of the bacon in advance of the partial performance of it, and the price was therefore left to subsequent adjustment. The Food Administration, by its regulations had already determined that the profit of the seller should not exceed 9 per cent. of the investment, or 2 1/2 per cent. of the gross sales. Under ordinary conditions, a valid agreement can be made for purchase and sale without the fixing of a specific price. In such a case a reasonable price is presumed to have been intended. In the case of United States v. Wilkins, L. Ed. 225, it was held under a proviso of the contract, which left the price to be adjusted by the government and the contractor, that it was to be the joint act of both parties and not the exclusive act of either, that if they could not agree, then a reasonable compensation was to be allowed, that that reasonable compensation was to be proved by competent evidence and settled by a jury and that the contractor at such a trial was at liberty to show that the sum allowed him by the Secretary of War was not a reasonable compensation. In United States v. Berdan Fire Arms Co., L. Ed. 530, a suit in the Court of Claims, it was objected that there was no price agreed upon and that the officers of the government were not authorized to agree upon a price. It was held that this was not material. The question was whether there was a contract for the use of the patent in that case, and not whether all the conditions of the use were provided for in such contract, that this was the ordinary rule in respect to the purchase of property or labor. 1 Williston, Contracts, § 41. We find, therefore, that by the writings and documents, all the necessary details making a valid contract were set forth in writing.
1
Third. Were they more than mere preliminary data upon which a subsequent formal contract was to be framed and signed? Taking the writings, together, it is quite evident that as between individuals such writings would constitute a single contract for the delivery of pounds of No. 10 bacon in monthly installments. As the Court of Claims points out:
2
'From the inception of the contract here involved bacon for January, February, and March deliveries was the matter to which the parties addressed themselves. At the conference of November 9, the total needs for the three months were made known. The plaintiff's proposal, the Food Administration's allotment, in so far as that is material, and Gen. Kniskern's award all covered the three months. Any separation of the month of March and its treatment as a matter of independent negotiation is therefore unauthorized.'
3
The fact that in January and February there were separate formal contracts of purchase of the bacon deliveries for those months signed by Capt. Shugert and Swift & Co. does not change our view that the original contract was made in November for the three months. These latter contracts were not made until much of the bacon had been delivered and the remainder was nearly ready for delivery and after the price could be determined from the actual cost of purchase of the hogs and the preparation of the bacon. The real function of these so-called formal contracts was to fix the price for the monthly settlements which had been postponed in accordance with the provision of the original contract until it could be fairly determined from the actual cost.
4
Fourth. We reach the question whether the contract was evidenced in writing as required by the statutes of the United States? Rev. Stats. § provides that:
5
'It shall be the duty of the Secretary of War, of the Secretary of the Navy, and of the Secretary of the Interior, to cause and require every contract made by them severally on behalf of the government, or by their officers under them appointed to make such contracts, to be reduced to writing, and signed by the contracting parties with their names at the end thereof.'
6
This has been qualified by a provision of a War Appropriation Act of March (Comp. St. s 6853b), reading as follows:
7
'That hereafter whenever contracts which are not to be performed within sixty days are made on behalf of the government by the Quartermaster General, or by officers of the Quartermaster Corps authorized to make them, and are in excess of $in amount, such contracts shall be reduced to writing and signed by the contracting parties. In all other cases contracts shall be entered into under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Quartermaster General.'
8
It is first contended on behalf of the government that under section Revised Statutes, the contract must be in one instrument and signed by both parties at the end thereof-that that is the effect of the words 'to be signed at the end thereof.' This section has been before this court a number of times, and it has never been clearly declared by this court to require the contract to be reduced to one instrument. In the case of South Boston Iron Co. v. United States, L. Ed. 69, the Court of Claims had held that the words 'with their names at the end thereof' required that the signatures should be appended to one instrument, but it was not necessary to the decision of the case. On review in this court, however, the papers relied on were held to be nothing more than preliminary memoranda made by the parties for use in preparing a contract for execution in the form required by law, which was never done. It was said that the whole matter was abandoned by the department after the memoranda had been made and that the Iron Company had never performed any of the work which was referred to and had never been called upon to do so.
9
The section has been under consideration before this court also in Clark v. United States, St. Louis Hay & Grain Co. v. United States, L. Ed. 130; United States v. Andrews & Co., United States v. New York & Porto Rico Steamship Co., Erie Coal & Coke Corporation v. United States, In no one of these has it been expressly decided that the requirements of section may not be met by an exchange of correspondence properly signed. But whether the contention by the government be true or not as to section the change in the Appropriation Act of in which the words 'signed by the parties at the end thereof' are omitted, clearly make unnecessary the evidencing of such contracts with the Quartermaster's Department by reduction to writing and signatures in one instrument. This was a contract made by the Quartermaster's Department and comes exactly within the amendment of and we see no reason why it does not constitute a binding contract upon the government under the general jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.
0
Some suggestion is made that the signature of Gen. Kniskern to the letter of December 10 was by another. The signature was:
1
'By authority of the Director of Purchase and Storage, A. D. Kniskern, Brigadier General, Q. M. Corps, Officer in Charge, by O. W. Menge, 2d Lieut., Q. M. Corps.'
2
It is evident from subsequent correspondence that Gen. Kniskern recognized this as his signature and as a binding contract. There seems no doubt about the authority of Lieut. Menge to attach his signature or that it was the regular practice in the office. In a similar case the Court of Claims (Union Twist Drill Co. v. United States, held that the affixing of the signature of a contracting officer by another duly authorized created no infirmity in the execution of the contract. A similar conclusion was reached by Attorney General Gregory, and by Attorney General Wirt, The conclusion we have come to in respect to the regularity and legality of the contract under the act of makes it unnecessary for us to consider the other ground upon which the Court of Claims sustained this recovery, to wit, full performance.
3
This brings us to the question of damages. The government contends that the Court of Claims did not adopt the proper rule in respect to damages. By the letter of January 24, General Kniskern, Zone Supply Officer, notified Swift & Co. that the only bacon the government would take during the month of March, 1919, would be such bacon as was then in process of cure over and above the quantity necessary to take care of the February awards and which had been passed by the inspectors. Swift & Co. received this on January 27th, and at once stopped the putting of bacon in cure, but proceeded with the curing, smoking and canning of bacon already in cure. March 5, 1919, Gen. Kniskern notified Swift & Co. that it would be necessary to discontinue production on all commodities which were not intended to apply against the February contract. Should Swift & Co. have any issue bacon which was now in smoke and which was in excess of the amount required, for the February delivery, it would be accepted. Swift & Co. received this notice on March 6th, and completed the smoking and canning of bacon which was already in smoke. When the notice of March 5th was received by Swift & Co., it had already in smoke for March delivery, pounds. This bacon was put up under government inspection. When the order was received, there also remained in process of cure, not needed for February deliveries, and intended for March delivery, pounds of bellies. These had been prepared under government inspection. On March 22, Swift & Co. notified Gen. Kniskern that at that time it had the bacon practically all packed and ready for delivery. It said,
4
'We are very short of storage room at each of these plants and will appreciate your giving us purchase order and shipping instructions in the very near future.'
5
 Gen. Kniskern wrote Swift & Co. that his office was taking preliminary steps toward an adjustment for materials on hand to be applied against the March deliveries, which had been canceled, and requested that a representative of Swift & Co. should be present at a conference to be held at his office on April 29, 1919, 'in order that you may be fully informed as to what methods should be followed by your firm in submitting your claim.' On April 29, he wrote to Swift & Co., inclosing papers 'necessary to prepare in order to file a claim for any amount you may consider due from the various packing house commodities allotted you for delivery during March, 1919, and on which you will suffer a loss by reason of cancellation of those orders.' And in a note of August 29, 1919, Gen. Kniskern, Zone Supply Officer, wrote as follows to Swift & Co.:
6
 Regarding your claim for the value of bacon prepared by you under allotment given by this office of November 9, 1918, and in view of the fact that this claim is still awaiting action of the Board of Contracts Adjustments in Washington, I desire to state the following:
7
'* * * It will be impossible for this office to give you positive and definite instructions as to the disposal of any of this product which may at this time be in your possession. It is, however, realized by this office that the product in question is of a perishable nature. Further, it is an important food product. In view of these two facts, it is believed that these products should be disposed of at the earliest possible moment. It will not be possible for the government to dispose of them until the negotiations are completed and the actual ownership determined by the government, taking them at the agreed price or turning them over to you on a basis similar to the salvage basis of unfinished material.
8
 In the judgment of this office, if you are able to dispose of this product by a sale within the limits of the United States, it would be a perfectly proper procedure, bearing in mind, of course, that having made such sale it will be necessary for you, when the later negotiations are in progress, to be able to convince a negotiating officer that the price you may have received for such part of this product as has been sold was justified by the conditions.
9
 In order that you may have some basis on which to proceed, in case you decide to attempt a sale of these products, you are informed that this office, under authority from Washington, is now selling, through the parcel post and to individuals, bacon, serial per can, or about cents per pound.
0
 Any sales that you may make at the price which is now being charged through the parcels post and to individuals would, in the judgment of this office, be entirely in the interests of the government.'
1
Thereupon Swift & Co. began selling the number 10 bacon it had prepared for March deliveries. It directed its branch houses and agents to sell this at $a can at wholesale, a price designed to permit the retailer to sell at the government's price and realize a profit for the handling of approximately one cent per pound. It sent out instructions to its representatives that the government was selling at $a can and added that it was desirable, therefore, that no dealer should sell for less than that. Subsequently, and from time to time, the government reduced its price on army bacon, and the plaintiff followed the government's price in its sales except that in a few localities it was able to procure a better price by reason of its ability to make prompt delivery, which the government could not do. The lowest price realized was $cents per pound, which was at or near the end of the period covered by these sales. The sale of the bulk of this product, approximately per cent. thereof, was completed in January, 1920, although there were sales of about cases in February and a few small sales thereafter, until October, 1920, during which month the last was sold. For this bacon sold at varying prices the plaintiff received $ and its expenses of sale were $.
2
The Court of Claims found that a fair contract price for the bacon on the basis upon which prices had theretofore been fixed, and the basis upon which it was contemplated by the parties that the price for this bacon would be fixed, was $ that the cost of the bacon put up by Squire & Co., a subsidiary of Swift & Co., for the account of Swift & Co., was $ and the fair contract price therefor as between the plaintiff and the United States on the basis above stated as within the contemplation of the parties was $ that the reasonable profit, if it had been permitted to complete and deliver this would have been $ and that the reasonable additional profit accruing to Swift & Co., if it had been permitted to manufacture and deliver serial No. 10 bacon up to pounds for March delivery, would have been $ leaving a balance, after deducting the net proceeds of sale, and certain other small items to be added, of $.
3
We think the necessary effect of the Court of Claims' findings is that Swift & Co. was diligent in disposing of this bacon at the best prices it was possible to secure. There was a very large amount of this particular bacon on the market, and the finding was that it was not particularly salable, because specially prepared under army orders to avoid spoiling; that it was not commercial bacon, like No. 8; that it required more time for preparation, and was not adapted to popular consumption, because of its more salty flavor.
4
The government complains that this army bacon might have been sold at an earlier time during the summer when pork was at a higher figure, and would have brought more money, but there is nothing in the findings to make a basis for this claim. The uncertainties as to the best method of disposition of such surplus supplies not needed by reason of demobilization justified care and deliberation. Swift & Co. seemed to be properly anxious not to embarrass the government by throwing what it had on the market. The large amount of bacon of this peculiar kind which had to be disposed of made its sale a matter of considerable delay. Swift & Co. were evidently anxious to conform as nearly as possible to the desires of the government, and did so. The bacon of this kind had no market price, and had to be worked off slowly. Under these conditions, there was no standard by which the usual rule of damages, namely the difference between the contract price and the market price, could be the measure of Swift & Co.'s loss through the failure of the government to receive the bacon. This was a case where the only standard could be the contract price and the amount realized at actual sale by diligent effort. The rule is that where there is no general market, or the merchandise is of a peculiar character and not staple, it is necessary that some other criterion be taken than the difference between the agreed price and the general market value. Fisher Hydraulic Stone & Machinery Co. v. Warner, Kinkead v. Lynch (C. C.) Leyner Engineering Works v. Mohawk Consolidated Leasing Co. (C. C.) Manhattan City, etc. Ry. Co. v. General Electric Co., Frederick v. American Sugar Refining Co. (C. C. A.) Barry v. Cavanaugh, Dunkirk Colliery Co. v. Lever (C. A.). 
5
For these reasons, the measure of damages adopted by the Court of Claims for the bacon which had been prepared under the contract and which the government did not take, was justified.
6
We come now to the question of the cross-appeal of Swift & Co. with reference to the bellies which were sent abroad for sale in April, after the government had indicated its desire to cancel the orders for March. These bellies had not been made into bacon. Of these pounds was sold in the United States at an average price of cents per pound. All of the remainder of them were shipped abroad. Those that went to Belgium were sold at 31 cents; to Norway, at 31 cents; to Germany, at 40 cents; and to France, at cents. Swift & Co. had theretofore, in ordinary course of business, exported similar products in large quantities, and believed that at this time it would find a good market, because of the widely reported shortage of food products in Europe. With these exportations Swift & Co. had shipped largely of other products on its own account, on which it sustained heavy losses. The Court of Claims in its opinion states that it is quite clear that, in seeking a foreign market for this product, plaintiff was acting in perfect good faith, and in accordance with its best judgment, based on former experiences in exporting and information then at hand as to markets to be anticipated abroad. But the court said that it did not think it could relieve itself from the consequences of its error in seeking a foreign market. 'It is true that it does not appear that it could have made other sales on the basis of those made in New York; on the contrary, it is rather to be implied that other purchasers were not then available, and that the one found would not buy further; but it seems to us that it was the duty of the plaintiff to have relied upon the home market, and to have taken such steps that it might show that it had exhausted that market before resort to a foreign one; and that, in the absence of such a showing, it assumed the risk of procuring such results as would demonstrate that the course taken had resulted beneficially to the other party.'
7
We do not agree with this conclusion. We do not think seeking a market in France was so different from attempting a sale in the United States as to indicate a disposition to speculate at the expense of the government. In view of the complete good faith manifested by Swift & Co. in this whole transaction, and the willingness on its part to give up its claim for larger damages for failure of the government to take the full March delivery, and, in the absence of proof that the bellies might have been disposed of anywhere else at a better price, we think the same result should be reached in case of the bellies as in that of the bacon. We think the government should pay the difference between the fair contract price, as found by the Court of Claims, and the actual sales of the material remaining. In that view there should be added to the recovery on the cross-appeal $ the excess of the contract price over the net amount realized.
8
The judgment of the Court of Claims is accordingly affirmed for the amount already allowed by it, with directions to allow the additional amount now awarded on the cross-appeal.

270 U.S. 163
GIRARD TRUST CO. et al.
v.
UNITED STATES.
Decided March 1, 1926.
1
This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims under section of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. § . The judgment was entered May 19, 1924, and the appeal was allowed July 3, 1924. The judgment dismissed the petition of the plaintiffs upon findings of fact. The Girard Trust Company and the other appellants are trustees of the estate of Alfred F. Moore, deceased.
1
2
Their claims are for interest not paid on refunds of taxes paid them. The proposed income tax upon the moore estate for as originally returned early in On March 15, 1921, and on June 15, 1921, quarterly payments of the tax, which amounted to $ each were paid to the collector. On August 2, 1921, the trustees for the estate filed a claim for the refund of the two installments, aggregating $ already paid, and claim for abatement of the two remaining quarterly installments not yet paid, aggregating the same amount. The claim for abatement was allowed in its entirety, and the claim for the refund in large part. The action of the department began December 9, 1922, in a schedule form, signed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, including an item of overassessments, and marked, 'Approved by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, for transmission to the proper accounting officers for credit and refund.' This was transmitted to the collector of internal revenue for the First district of Pennsylvania to examine the account of the taxpayer, to report back the amount to be refunded and the amount to be credited on taxes due and unpaid. The collector made the report. The Assistant Commissioner of Internal Revenue confirmed the report and the Commissioner directed the refund January 16, 1923. On February 20, 1923, the trustees received by mail a certificate of overassessment dated February 10, 1923, stating that since $was assessed, whereas $was the correct tax, there had been an overassessment of $ and that the amount of this overassessment had been applied as follows:
2
3
With this certificate was a check for $ the amount of the refund without interest. Since filing the petition in this case the trustees received, under date of October interest on the refund and the credit of $from six months after the filing of the claim for refund to December 9, 1922.

4
Moore's estate made return to the collector of internal revenue for excess profits tax for the year and on March 21, 1918, paid to the collector of internal revenue $ the amount of the tax less the credit of $allowed for payment in advance of the time fixed by law, June 15, 1918. Ascertaining that the trustees of a trust estate were not subject to excess profits tax, on August 2, 1921, they filed a claim for refund of the entire tax of $ This claim was approved by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for $ on December 9, 1922, under the prescribed schedule form in which this item was marked 'Approved by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, for transmission to the proper accounting officer for credit and refund.' It was sent to the proper collector of internal revenue who reported it back to the bureau. It was approved by the Assistant Commissioner and the refund was finally approved by the Commissioner, January 16, 1923. On February 7, 1923, the plaintiffs received by mail a certificate of overassessment dated February 6, 1923, for $ together with a check for $ the difference $being interest on the amount refunded from the date six months after the filing of the claim to December 9, 1922.
4
5
The contentions of the Trustees are that the allowances of interest on the refunds are not sufficient under the statute. Section b) of the Revenue Act of November (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. tt), provides:
5
6
'As soon as practicable after the return is filed, the Commissioner shall examine it. If it then appears that the correct amount of the tax is greater of less than that shown in the return, the installments shall be recomputed. If the amount already paid exceeds that which should have been paid on the basis of the installments as recomputed, the excess so paid shall be credited against the subsequent installments; and if the amount already paid exceeds the correct amount of the tax, the excess shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of section '
6
7
Section of the above act, (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. uu) provides:
7
8
'That if, upon examination of any return * * * it appears that an amount of income, war profits or excess profits tax has been paid in excess of that properly due, then, notwithstanding the provisions of section of the Revised Statutes, the amount of the excess shall be credited against any income, war profits or excess profits taxes, or installment thereof, then due from the taxpayer under any other return, and any balance of such excess shall be immediately refunded to the taxpayer. * * *' Section a) of the same statute, (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. j), contains the provision as to interest as follows:
8
9
'That upon the allowance of a claim for the refund of or credit for internal revenue taxes paid, interest shall be allowed and paid upon the total amount of such refund or credit at the rate of one-half of 1 per centum per month to the date of such allowance, as follows: (1) If such amount was paid under a specific protest setting forth in detail the basis of and reasons for such protest, from the time when such tax was paid, or (2) if such amount was not paid under protest but pursuant to an additional assessment, from the time such additional assessment was paid, or (3) if no protest was made and the tax was not paid pursuant to an additional assessment, from six months after the date of filing of such claim for refund or credit. The term 'additional assessment' as used in this section means a further assessment for a tax of the same character previously paid in part.'
9
10
The claims made by the trustees, appellants here, are, first, that the government erred in its construction of section by which it allowed interest, not to the dates of payments of the refunds February 20 and February 7, 1913, but only to the date when the Commissioner approved the schedule finding the amount of the overassessments and transmitted the schedule to the accounting officers December 9, 1922. The interest between December 9, 1922, down to the dates of payment amounts to $ The question is whether the words 'to the date of the allowance' mean to the date of the decision of the Commssioner that an overassessment has been made, i. e., to December 9, 1922, to the final approval of the refund by the Commissioner January 16, 1923, or to the date of payment.
10
11
The next claim of the trustees is for $ and this turns on the question whether under section the interest on the refund for the taxes should be calculated under clause (1) in that section as for a payment made under a specific protest or whether as upon a payment under clause (3) for which no protest was made. The Commissioner held that no sufficient protest had been made and therefore allowed interest, not from the time of payment as provided under clause (1), but from six months after the filing of the claim for refund under clause (3), which made a difference of $.
11
12
The third claim of the trustees is for $ This is based on the fact that under the Revenue Act of October a credit on taxes to be paid in advance, calculated at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum upon the amount so paid from the date of payment to the date fixed by law for payment was allowed and the amount paid was $less than the amount assessed. The claim for refund was allowed for the amount actually paid, but not for the discount. The trustees now seek to recover the discount.
12
13
The Court of Claims dismissed the petition for all these claims on the authority of Stewart v. Barnes, The taxpayer in that case had already received and accepted the principal of the amount improperly collected by a collector of internal revenue, and this was an action for the interest. This court held that the taxpayer could not maintain an independent action for interest, for the reason that in such cases interest is considered as damages, does not form the basis of the action, and is only an incident to the recovery of the principal debt. We do not think that it controls this case. The payment of interest in the Stewart Case was not expressly provided for in the act. In this case there is statutory provision for it, and it is analogous to a suit in debt or covenant in which the contract specifically provides for payment of interest on the principal debt. In such cases the authorities all hold that the acceptance of the payment of the principal debt does not preclude a further suit for the interest unpaid. Fake v. Eddy, 15 Wend. (N. Y.) 76; Kimball v. Williams, 36 App. D. C. , 1331; New York Trust Co. v. Detroit Railway Co., King v. Phillips, Bennett v. Federal Coal & Coke Co., L. R. A. (N. S.) Robbins v. Cheek, And the same rule obtains where the obligation is one that by statute bears interest. National Bank v. Mechanic's Bank, Hobbs v. United States, New York v. United States, Crane v. Craig, Bowen v. Minneapolis, Am. St. Rep. Blair v. United States ex rel. Birkenstock, App. D. C. 
13
14
We are therefore brought to the merits of the case. First, what is the meaning in section of the words 'to the date of such allowance' to which interest is to be paid on refunds? The Treasury Department, by its regulations of construed this provision as follows:
14
15
'A claim for refund or credit is allowed within the meaning of the statute when the Commissioner approves the schedule in whole or in part, for transmission to the proper accounting officer, for credit or refund.'
15
16
And this is the holding of the Comptroller General. 1 Decisions Compt. Gen. He says:
16
17
'To compute interest to the date of actual payment would be wholly impracticable from an administrative standpoint, and I have no doubt that this phase of the matter was considered by the Congress in providing that the interest should be allowed to the date of allowance rather than to the date of payment of the claim.'
17
18
If Congress had intended that interest should be allowed to the date of the payment, it seems to us it would have said so. Allowance in its ordinary sense does not mean payment, and in the practical administration of the Treasury Department the two things are quite different. The one is a decision by the competent authority that the payment should be made. The other is the actual payment. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue is the final judge in the administrative branch of the government to decide that an overassessment has been made and that a refund or credit should be granted, and when he has made that decision finally, he has allowed the claim for the refund or credit of the taxes paid within the meaning of the section.
18
19
It is said that this is a remedial statute and was intended to require the government to recoup the taxpayer unjustly dealt with by paying interest during the whole time the money was detained. That was doubtless its general purpose. But the statute is to be construed in the light of the difficulties of the government bookkeeping and accounting. To have made the interest calculable to the date of actual payment would have led to uncertainty and confusion, as the Comptroller General indicates, and it was doubtless for that reason that Congress qualified its desire to pay interest for the exact time during which the money was detained to a date which was practical from an administrative standpoint. Nor does the fact that pending the carrying out of the direction of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to make the refund, he might reverse himself, change the finality of his decision allowing the refund. If he does so, the date fixed as the date of the allowance under the section is changed, of course; but the mere fact that he can reverse a final allowance does not prevent its being a final allowance, any more than, when a court renders a judgment, its ability within the term to set it aside or change it affects its finality, if it is not changed. We think, therefore, that the words 'to the date of such allowance' do not carry interest to be paid on refunds down to the time of payment.
19
20
We cannot concur, however, in the view of the Treasury Department that the date of the allowance of the claim as intended by the statute is the date when the Commissioner first decides that there has been an overassessment and sends upon a proper form his decision to the collector of internal revenue, who made the collection and keeps the account with the taxpayer. The findings and the exhibits show that the course of business is that the collector on receiving from the Commissioner the schedule as to the overassessment, examines his books and reports back to the bureau the amount which should be credited on taxes due and the amount to be refunded, that this is examined by the Assistant Commissioner and then is delivered to the Commissioner, who makes it effective by his approval. Until it reaches him and is approved by him, the refund cannot be paid. This we think is the real date of allowance. Until that time, the exact amount of the refund is not fixed finally by competent authority. This date would seem to be just as certain and convenient from an administrative standpoint as that of the original decision of the Commissioner, and it is certainly more in conformity to the general purpose of Congress to relieve the overassessed taxpayer by paying compensatory interest on money unjustly taken and kept by the Government. We think, therefore, that the trustees are entitled to recover from the government interest on both the refund for the taxes of and that for those of from December 9, 1922, to January 16, 1923.
20
21
Second. This second claim turns on the provisos of section with reference to protests. The trustees attached to their original return of income tax for the following protest:
21
22
'Note.-Profit was made during the year upon sales of capital assets as set forth in block C above. This amount of $is included in the total net income and under regulations is returned for tax on Form As the taxpayer is advised that such sum is not taxable income, under the decision of Brewster v. Walsh-District Court for District of Connecticut made December 16, 1920-the report of the amount of such profit is made and tax paid thereon only under protest, and only in compliance with the requirement of the foregoing form and the instructions thereon.'
22
23
Both the installments of the income tax paid March 15 and June 15 were paid under this protest. On the 15th of June, however, there was added to the protest the following memorandum:

'In view of the joint investigation by accountants of both government and trustees now in progress, with the agreed object of correcting certain figures, especially those relating to depreciation, believed to have been erroneously increased, as to the most important item and ignored as to another item, in the return of said trustees covering the sale of the three capital assets in that return set forth, estimating the total of said profits and the tax payable thereon out of the trust estate.
24
25
'Inasmuch as the second quarterly installment of $based upon said estimate is now due, you are hereby notified that the accompanying payment thereof is made without prejudice to the right of said trust estate to be hereafter relieved from or reimbursed for the payment of any tax upon the profits so returned in excess of the total tax, resulting from such final adjustment thereof as may be determined, either by agreement, or by the courts. * * *'
25
26
The government's contention is that the distinction made in section by which the interest to be paid on refunded taxes is to date from the payment of the taxes in cases where there is a specific protest setting forth in detail the basis and reasons for such protest, and by which the interest is to be dated only from six months after the date of filing the claim for refund or credit when there is no protest, was intended to favor those who furnished to the collecting officers by way of specific protest a valid basis for a refund of the taxes.
26
27
We agree with this view. To hold otherwise would be to invite a protest on any pretended ground by taxpayers in every case of payment, and would make the protest of no value to the Treasury or the collecting officers. A protest is for the purpose of inviting attention of the taxing officers to the illegality of the collection, so that they may take remedial measures at once. But, if protests are based on reasons of no validity, they do not accomplish the public purpose for which they are devised.
27
28
In the present case, the protest was based on a decision of the District Court of Connecticut made December 16, 1920. Brewster v. Walsh, That case was reversed in Walsh v. Brewster, March 28, 1921, or more than two months before the payment of the June 15 installment by the trustees. The statement added under the June 15 installment was merely a recital that an investigation was going on between the government and the trustees, and that, if that turned out to be in excess of the right amount, the payment was without prejudice to the recovery of the excess. This was certainly not a protest for specific reasons, in accordance with the requirement of the statute. For these reasons, we think that no recovery can be had for failure to allow interest for the period of the six months after the date of payment.
28
29
Third. The third item of the recovery here sought is for the $of discount allowed by the government upon the amount returned for taxation on the income for by the trustees on the excess profits tax. The tax assessed was $ It was not due until June 15, 1918. Under section of the Revenue Act of October it was provided that the Secretary of the Treasury, under rules and regulations prescribed by him, should permit taxpayers liable to income and excess profits taxes to make payments in advance in installments or in whole of an amount not in excess of the estimated taxes which would be due from them, provided that the Secretary of the Treasury, under rules and regulations prescribed by him, might allow credit against such taxes so paid in advance of an amount not exceeding three per centum per annum calculated upon the amount so paid from the date of such payment to the date fixed by law for such payment, but that on such credit should be allowed on payments in excess of taxes determined to be due.
29
30
We do not see the basis upon which such recovery can be had. The taxpayer cannot obtain a refund under the other sections quoted except for taxes paid. By reason of his payment earlier than required, he has been permitted to reduce the amount which he actually paid. But there is no provision in the statute for a recovery of anything but what he did pay, or for interest on anything but on what he did pay. We think that, if Congress intended him to recover interest for his accommodation of the government by a premature payment of his taxes illegally collected, it would have made a specific provision for it and have given the Commissioner special authority.
30
31
This disposes of the three claims. The conclusion of the Court of Claims is therefore affirmed in all respects, except as to the interest on the refunds on the taxes illegally collected for the year and for the year for the period from the 9th of December, 1922, to January 16, 1923, which the trustees should recover.
31
32
The judgment is therefore reversed, and the cause is remanded to the Court of Claims, with directions to enter a judgment in accordance with this opinion.

MIDLAND LAND & IMPROVEMENT CO.
v.
UNITED STATES.
Argued Jan. 8-11, 1926.
1
On August 12, 1907, the Midland Land & Improvement Company agreed with the United States to dredge and dispose of cubic yards of material in Newark Bay and Passaic river at cents per yard, payable as the work progressed. The contract provided that the work should be prosecuted with 'faithfulness and energy,' and that the rate of work 'will be at least cubic yards per month.' On September 24, 1912, the company stopped work, leaving much unperformed. In the government declared the contract 'annulled,' and had the uncompleted part of the work done by another contractor, who was paid cents per yard. See United States v. O'Brien, L. Ed. 481. The additional cost to the government was $ The Midland contract provided that the government would reserve from each payment 10 per cent. until half of the work was completed, and that the amount reserved might be applied toward reimbursing it for any additional cost resulting from the contractor's default. The sum of $ which had been reserved, was so applied. In the company brought this suit in the Court of Claims to recover the amount. Upon elaborate findings of fact that court entered judgment for the United States. The case is here on appeal, taken May 15, 1924, under section of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. § .
1
2
It is contended that, at the time when the government annulled the contract, the amount of work done had exceeded the aggregate of the monthly requirements, and hence that the company was not in default. This question we have no occasion to consider. The correspondence between the parties and other facts found warranted the conclusion that the company had abandoned the work and refused to complete the contract. There was thus an anticipatory breach by the company, which entitled the government to relet the uncompleted part of the work. Compare Smoot's Case, L. Ed. 107; Dingley v. Oler, L. Ed. 984. It is also contended that the judgment is erroneous, because it was incumbent upon the government to show that the uncompleted work done under the later contract did not materially depart from that described in the repudiated contract, and that this was not shown. See United States v. Axman, L. Ed. 1198. The lower court concluded that the uncompleted part of the work was relet on the same specifications. Enough appears to show that the loss to the government resulting from the plaintiff's repudiation of the contract far exceeded the amount reserved.

TOWAR COTTON MILLS, Inc.,
v.
UNITED STATES.
Argued Jan. 29, 1926.
1
This appeal was taken from a judgment of the Court of Claims (Judicial Code, § , before its repeal by Act Feb. ), dismissing appellant's petition and adjudging that the United States was entitled to recover on a counterclaim set up in its answer in that court.
1
2
The appellant entered into a contract with the government, dated June 24, 1918, to supply it with a quantity of cloth at a specified price. It was provided by the contract that the government might, in the event of the termination of the war, cancel the contract with respect to cloth not delivered. The contract contained a clause for ascertaining the balance due and payable to the appellant in case of cancellation. By a second contract of July 6, 1918, the government undertook to advance money to appellant for the purchase of machinery, equipment, and raw material required for the performance of its original contract. Appellant gave its demand note for the principal sum advanced, with interest at 6 per cent., and it was provided by the contract that specified deductions from payments, as they became due from the government for the cloth delivered, should be credited on the note.
2
3
On November 15, 1918, the government canceled the original contract after per cent. of the deliveries stipulated for had been made. Appellant presented a claim to the War Department for the amount due under this contract, and after proceedings had before the Purchase Claims Board, and an appeal to the Board of Contract Adjustment, an award was made to appellant, by authority of the Secretary of War, in the sum of $ which was stated by its terms to be 'in full adjustment, payment, and discharge of said agreement' of June 24, 1918.
3
4
On June 3, 1920, appellant accepted the award by a formal statement to that effect, written at the end of it and signed by the appellant, by its treasurer.
4
5
The cause of action stated by appellant is upon its first contract of June 24, 1918, and, as the Court of Claims found, all of the items set up by appellant in this suit were embodied in its claim to the War Department on which the award was made. The government pleaded, by way of counterclaim, the balance due upon the appellant's promissory note, less the amount of the award, and judgment was given against the appellant for this amount, with accrued interest.
5
6
Appellant, notwithstanding such cases as United States v. Adams, L. Ed. 249; Savage, Executrix, v. United States, United States v. Child & Co., L. Ed. 360; United States v. Justice, Mason v. United States, L. Ed. 564, seeks to avoid the effect of the accepted award by setting up that the Secretary of War was without authority to make it and, upon various technical grounds, that appellant's acceptance was not binding.
6
7
It is unnecessary for us to consider these contentions; for there are no findings by the Court of Claims that appellant suffered any loss or damage by reason of the cancellation of the contract, and in fact no findings which would support a judgment in its favor on any theory.
7
8
The appellant also objects that, if the award is valid, it is a bar to the government's counterclaim. But an examination of the award, which is set out in detail in the findings, shows that the award was concerned only with the first contract of June 24, 1918, and that the items and computations which entered into it related only to that contract. The amount due from the government upon appellant's note and second contract was unaffected by it.
8
9
There is no merit in the objection that the amount of the award should have been credited on appellant's note as of the date of the cancellation of the first contract, thus reducing the amount of interest payable on the note. If the award was valid, it was properly credited as of its date. If it was invalid, appellant, as already pointed out, has laid no foundation for any offset to the amount due on the note.

Judgment affirmed.

271 U.S. 58
READING CO.
v.
KOONS.
Decided April 12, 1926.
1
Respondent's intestate, while employed by the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company, an interstate carrier of which petitioner is the successor, received injuries from which he died on the following day, April 23, 1915. Letters of administration were granted to respondent September 23, 1921. Five months later, on February 6, 1922, nearly seven years after the death, respondent brought the action now under review in the Pennsylvania court of common pleas to establish a liability under the federal Employers' Liability Act. Act of April as amended by the Act of April (Comp. St. § et seq.).
1
2
A petition of the defendant below, petitioner here, for judgment of nol. pros. on the ground that the action, having been brought more than two years after the death, was barred by the statute of limitations, was denied (26 Dauphin County (Pa.) Reports , and judgment was entered for plaintiff, respondent here. On an appeal to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the judgment was affirmed. This court granted certiorari. 
2
3
As respondent brought his action more than two years after the death and less than two years after his appointment as administrator, the sole question presented for review is whether, in an action for wrongful death brought under the federal Employers' Liability Act, the Two-year statute of limitations begins to run at the date of the death or at the date of the appointment of the administrator of the decedent.
3
4
The federal Employers' Liability Act imposes upon common carriers by railroad, engaged in interstate commerce, liability for the death of an employee employed in such commerce, when the death results from the negligence of the carrier or its agents, and gives a right of action to the personal reppesentative of the decedent for the benefit of the surviving spouse and children of such employee, or if there are no such survivors, then for the benefit of his dependent next of kin. By section 6 of the act, it is provided:
4
5
'That no action shall be maintained under this act unless commenced within two years from the day the cause of action accrued.'
5
6
The application of this statute turns on the question whether the cause of action created by the act may be deemed to have 'accrued,' within the meaning of the act, at the time of death or on the appointment of the administrator, who is the only person authorized by the statute to maintain the action. American R. R. of Porto Rico v. Birch, St. Louis, S. F. & T. Ry. v. Seale, Ann. Cas. The question had never been directly answered by this court, although in Missouri, K. & T. Ry. v. Wulf, Ann. Cas. it was assumed that the cause of action was barred in two years after the death.
6
7
It has received conflicting answers in the decisions of other courts. The decision of the First Circuit Court of Appeals in American R. R. of Porto Rico v. Coronas, L. R. A. holding that the statute does not begin to run until the appointment of the administrator has been followed in Guinther v. Philadelphia & R. Ry. (C. C. A.) in Kierejewski v, Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. (D. C.) and in Bird v. Ft. Worth & Rio Grande Railway, Other cases have laid down a similar rule with respect to state laws giving a right of recovery for wrongful death. Andrews v. Hartford & New Haven R. R., 34 Conn. 57; Crapo v. City of Syracuse. 
7
8
On the other hand, the Supreme Court of Georgia (Seaboard Air Line v. Brooks, and the Supreme Court of Kansas (Giersch v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry., have expressly declined to follow the rule laid down in the First Circuit in American R. R. of Porto Rico v. Coronas, supra. The same result was reached in Bixler v. Pennsylvania R. R. (D. C.) and a like rule has been applied in state courts to similar state statutes. See Radezky v. Sargent & Co., Rodman v. Ry., Swisher v. Ry., Carden, Adm'r, v. L. & N. R. R., Gulledge v. R. R., Am. St. Rep. Hall v. R. R.. 
8
9
This diversity of view arises principally from the attempt made to find in the word 'accrued,' used in the statute, some definite technical meaning which will in itself enable courts to say at what point of time the cause of action has come into existence, and consequently at what point of time the statute of limitations begins to run.
9
10
It is argued in support of one view, as the court below held, that as the cause of action for death is the creature of statute, and is given exclusively to the administrator of the decedent, no cause of action can arise or accrue until there is an administrator. On the other hand, it is asserted with, we think, equal plausibility, that, when all of the events have occurred which determine the liability of the common carrier, the cause of action has come into existence or has 'accrued.'
10
11
We do not think it is possible to assign to the word 'accrued' any definite technical meaning which by itself would enable us to say whether the statutory period begins to run at one time or the other; but the uncertainty is removed when the word is interpreted in the light of the general purposes of the statute and of its other provisions, and with due regard to those practical ends which are to be served by any limitation of the time within which an action must be brought.
11
12
Whatever effect may be given to the assertion often made in judicial opinion that in the ordinary case where a cause of action arises in favor of the estate of a decedent there is no person who can enforce it if there is no executor or administrator,1 that statement cannot be applied strictly to causes of action for death arising under the federal Employers' Liability Act. For while it is true that the executor or administrator is the person authorized to bring the suit, he nevertheless acts only for the benefit of persons specifically designated in the statute. At the time of death there are identified persons for whose benefit the liability exists and who can start the machinery of the law in motion to enforce it, by applying for the appointment of an administrator. This court has held that a suit brought by such persons in their individual capacity is not a nullity within the provisions of the act, and that if by amendment the plaintiff is properly described as executor or administrator of the decedent, even though the amendment is had after the expiration of the statutory period, the suit may be maintained and a recovery had under the statute. See Missouri, K. & T. Ry. v. Wulf, supra. See, also, Seaboard Air Line v. Renn, and New York C. & H. R. R. R. Co. v. Kinney, Thus at the death of decedent there are real parties in interest who may procure the action to be brought, and there are no such practical inconveniences or necessary delays as would lead to the conclusion that the word 'accrued,' as used in the statute, cannot be taken to refer to the time of death.
12
13
The language of the statute evidences an intention to set a definite limit to the period within which an action may be brought under it without reference to the exigencies which arise from the administration of a decedent's estate. The statute relates not only to causes of action for wrongful death but to causes of action for other injuries. Where the cause of action for personal injury survives to personal representatives of an injured employee who dies after the injury from other causes, the language of the statute seems peremptorily to require the action to be brought within two years from the time of injury, without regard to any intervening period after death when there is no executor or administrator. Compare Whipple v. Johnson, Gibson v. Ruff, Sammis v. Wightman, Sanford v. Sanford. 
13
14
It cannot be supposed that Congress, in enacting the statute intended to impose a fixed limitation of two years within which all actions for personal injury must be begun, regardless of death and of the time of appointment of an administrator of the injured employee, and at the same time intended to allow an indefinite period within which application may be made for the appointment of an administrator as the prerequisite to an action to recover for wrongful death. Indeed the limitation would seem to be more necessary in the case of personal injuries than in the case of a wrongful death; for in the former case some part of the period of limitations will have run at the time of death. This inconsistency is avoided if the word 'accrued,' whether applied to causes of action for personal injury or for wrongful death, be taken to apply uniformly to the time when the events have occurred which determine that the carrier is liable, even though the particular person through whose agency the liability is to be enforced has not been designated.
14
15
It is argued that as it was provided by Lord Campbell's Act that the period of limitation should run from the time of death, the omission of that phraseology from the Employers' Liability Act indicates that it was the intention of Congress that the statutory period should run from a different time, namely, from the time of the appointment of an administrator. This argument, however, leaves out of account the fact that the present statute deals with causes of action arising from personal injury as well as causes of action arising from a wrongful death. The limitation that no action shall be maintained under this act unless commenced within two years from the day the cause of action accrued, applies to both. This accounts for the omission of any specific reference to death in fixing the period of limitation; and the fact that the limitation is made applicable equally to the Two causes of action, one of which admittedly 'accrues' on the happening of the events which fix the defendant's liability, leads persuasively to the conclusion that a like test was intended for determining when the cause of action accrued for wrongful death.
15
16
Every paractical consideration which would lead to the imposition of any period of limitation, would requrie that the period should begin to run from the definitely ascertained time of death rather than the uncertain time of the appointment of an administrator. Here the appointment was not made until six years after the death. No reason appears, if the opinion of the court below is followed, why the time might not have been extended The only persons who can procure The only persons who can prudure the appointement of an administrator are ordinarily spouse, next of kin, or creditors of the decedent. Certainly the common carrier whoud have no standing to make the application. The very purpose of a period of limitation is that there may be, at some definitely ascertained period, an end to litigation. If the persons who are the designated beneficiaries of the right of action created may choose their own time for applying for the appointment of an administrator and consequently for setting the statute running, the two-year period of limitation so far as it applies to actions for wrongful death might as well have been omitted from the statute. An interpretation of a statute purporting to set a definite limitation upon the time of bringing action, without saving clauses, which would, nevertheless, leave defendants subject indefinitely to actions for the wrong done, would, we think, defeat its obvious purpose. There is nothing in the language of the statute to require, or indeed to support, such an interpretation.

Judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is reversed.

HARTSVILLE OIL MILL
v.
UNITED STATES.
Argued March 3 and 4, 1926.
1
On February 5, 1923, a bill (S. was introduced in the Senate authorizing and directing the Secretary of the Treasury to pay to named persons, firms, and corporations, including the appellant, 'which entered into contracts with the United States of America through the agency of the United States Ordinance Department, which contracts were canceled by said Ordinance Department, the several sums set opposite their names.' By Senate Resolution of March 3, 1922, the bill, with accompanying documents, was referred to the Court of Claims for consideration and report. Judicial Code, § . Appellant filed its petition in the Court of Claims, referring to the Senate bill and resolution setting up a claim upon a contract of September 26, 1918, for the sale of cotton linters to the government. The Court of Claims held, upon the facts found, that it had jurisdiction to render a judgment under the provisions of chapter 7 of the Judicial Code; that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover upon its claim, and entered judgment dismissing the petition.
1
2
The case comes here on appeal. Judicial Code, § , before its repeal by the Act of February .
2
3
The petition sets out a cause of action for failure of the government to perform its contract of September 26, 1918, and by way of anticipation of a defense, alleges that a later contract of December 31, 1918, between appellant and the government, purporting to cancel the earlier contract, was procured by duress and was without consideration. The jurisdiction to hear and determine the claim is conferred by Judicial Code, § , and was not enlarged or otherwise affected by the Senate resolution.
3
4
The petitioner, a South Carolina corporation, was engaged in the business of crushing cotton seed for the production of cotton seed oil, cotton seed meal and other cotton seed products, including cotton linters, which are the short fibers adhering to cotton seed after the removal of the staple cotton by ginning. During the late war, cotton linters were used extensively in the manufacture of explosives. After the entry of the United States into the war, appellant, with all others engaged in the production of cotton seed products, became subject to the direction and control of the War Industries Board (Act May (Comp. St. Comp St. Ann. Supp. )), and of the United States Food Administration (Act Aug. (Comp. St. Comp. St. Ann. Supp. e et seq.)), with respect to the production and distribution of their product and the prices of both the raw material purchased and the product sold by them. This control was an essential feature of a plan to stabilize price and stimulate production.
4
5
Appellant, by its contract, which was similar in form and content to those of the other manufacturers named in the Senate resolution, agreed to sell to the government its estimated product of cotton linters for the year ending July 31, 1918, approximately pounds, at cents per pound. The contract contained a clause authorizing the government to cancel it 'in the event of the termination of the present war' with the proviso that the seller should continue to make deliveries for 30 days after the effective date of the cancellation and that the government should save the seller harmless from actual loss resulting from the cancellation.
5
6
In November, 1918, after the Armistice, negotiations were begun between the Cotton Products Section of the War Industries Board and a committee representing appellant and other manufacturers, for the adjustment and settlement of all obligations upon appellant's contract of September 26th and all similar contracts. In the course of these negotiations it was contended by the representatives of the government and denied by the committee that the termination of the war had occurred, within the meaning of the cancellation clause. The War Industries Board ceased to function on December 21, 1918, and these negotiations were continued on behalf of the government by representatives of the Ordinance Department. On December 30, 1918, officers of this department notified the committee that the government would settle its obligations upon these contracts only by accepting the linters then on hand and inspected, about bales, and would take only a part of the linters produced between January 1 and July 31, 1919, not to exceed bales, the amount taken to be prorated among the manufacturers. At the same time they notified the committee that, unless this proposal was accepted within one hour from the time it was made, the government would refuse to perform its contracts, and would refuse to accept or pay for any linters, either on hand with the manufacturers or afterwards produced by them, and that appellant and other manufacturers could seek their remedy in the courts.
6
7
Within the hour the committee, although protesting against the government's interpretation of the contract and the position taken by its representatives, notified them that the manufacturers would accede to the proposed modification of their contracts. On the same day the Ordnance Department gave to appellant and other manufacturers telegraphic notice of the cancellation of their contracts, and on January 2, 1919, a form of contract, embodying the verbal agreement reached between the officers of the Ordinance Department and the committee, was submitted to the appellant and the other manufacturers, accompanied by a copy of a letter of the Ordinance Department stating that linters would not be accepted by the government from any producer who refused to execute the contract. Appellant's counsel assisted in the preparation of this letter. The form contract, dated December 31, 1919, was signed by appellant; it contained recitals of the cancellation of the earlier contract of September, 1918; that a dispute had arisen as to whether the war had terminated and as to the measure of damages provided by the cancellation clause in the earlier contract, and stipulated that the new contract was in lieu of cancellation of the earlier contract and a modification of it.
7
8
The findings of the Court of Claims establish appellant's right to recover under the earlier contract, if it was not modified by the later one. Appellant urges that the later contract does not bar such recovery because the coercive measures resorted to by officers of the Ordinance Department, to induce its execution, amount in law to duress, rendering the second contract invalid and without force to modify the first. To support this position appellant relies on the serious consequences which the industry would have suffered if the government had wholly refused to perform its contracts. It asserts that bales of linters already inspected by the government were in the hands of manufacturers; that a million tons of cotton seed, purchased at the uniform price of $70 fixed by the government, were on hand; that the manufacturers had made commitments for the purchase of $tons in the hands of farmers. It is contended that the government's refusal to carry out the contracts would have resulted in the failure of the scheme for the stabilization of the price of cotton seed and its products, and in the collapse of the business structure which had been reared upon the basis of the stabilized price, and that great loss would have resulted to appellant and other manufacturers. A difficulty encountered by the appellant at the outset is that this view is not supported by the findings made. On its own theory of the case, appellant must prove the probable injury which it would have suffered from the threatened refusal of the government to carry out its contract, and that fear of that loss was the effective cause of its executing the settlement contract. Any inference that the business of manufacturing and distributing cotton seed products would have been disastrously affected, would avail appellant nothing because it does not appear what the consequences to its own business and finances would have been.
8
9
The findings establish that on December 30, 1918, there were in the hands of manufacturers bales of linters; but it does not appear what proportion of them, if any, were in the hands of appellant. There is no finding with respect to the amount of cotton seed or cotton seed products in the hands of the manufacturers. There is no finding with respect to the nature or extent of the commitments of the manufacturers for the purchase of seed, or as to the nature of extent of the loss which appellant would have suffered if on December 30, 1918, the government had refused to go forward with its contract, or that the legal damages for such breach of contract would not have been adequate to compensate for its loss. There is no finding that appellant was induced to sign the settlement contract by fear of the consequences of a refusal to sign.
9
10
In applying to the facts of this case the principles which control duress as a legal ground for avoidance of a contract, we are limited to such conclusions of law as may be drawn from the fact, found by the court below, that appellant signed the settlement contract after negotiations, in the course of which the threat was made that the government would disregard the admitted obligations of its contracts unless those entitled to the performance of them would yield to its demands. This threat was discreditable to the officers who made it and injurious to the government, whose high obligation to deal justly and according to law, with those with whom it had contracts, might well have been their first concern. But a threat to break a contract does not in itself constitute duress. Before the coercive effect of the threatened action can be inferred, there must be evidence of some probable consequences of it to person or property for which the remedy afforded by the courts is inadequate. Silliman v. United States, Rosenfeld v. Boston Mut. Life Ins. Co., Hackley v. Headley, Goebel v. Linn, Am. Rep. Cable v. Foley, Wood v. Telephone Co., Secor v. Clark, Doyle v. Rector, etc., Trinity Church, Smithwick v. Whitley, Earle v. Berry, Ann. Cas. And see Mason v. United States, L. Ed. 564; United States v. Child. 
10
11
Freund v. United States, Hunt v. United States, and United States v. Smith, L. Ed. 808, relied upon by appellant present different considerations from those involved here. All were cases in which government contractors were called on to perform extra services, the representatives of the government taking the position that the services demanded were stipulated for by the contracts. In each it was held that the services were not contemplated by the contract, and that the contractor did not assent to the government's construction. There was consequently no legal bar to the contractor's recovering the fair value of the service rendered to the government, the Postmaster General having authority to request the services and to pay for them. See, also, United States v. Stage Co., L. Ed. 251; St. Louis S. W. Ry. v. United States, Here the appellant is confronted with the finding that it has executed a formal contract which bars its recovery unless it sustains the burden of proving duress.

These are three appeals from the Court of Claims, which it is convenient to dispose of together.

The Sun Shipbuilding Company sought compensation on account of several items, chiefly one for loss sustained by it in obeying the request of certain naval officers and the Secretary of the Navy to hold free from other use a shipway which they thought would probably be needed for the construction of one of a number of mine sweepers which the claimant was under a cost plus contract to build. The claimant had private contracts to execute in which it could use this way, and which were thus delayed. The negotiation as to this way took place before the contract was drafted and executed. The contract provided for a compensation board to fix the cost, and specified elements of cost to be considered, including a proper proportion for loss resulting from displacement of, or delay, in work contracted for prior to the date of the contract caused by or attributed to work under emergency conditions by the contractor for the government, and items similar thereto in principle. The Court of Claims held that all the items of the claim were covered by the decision and award of the board, except one for $ for which it gave judgment. On the findings and the contract we hold the conclusion correct, deny the motion to remand, and affirm the judgment.

The Kenilworth Company leased its hotel as Asheville to the government for five months for use as a hospital, with a restriction that it should not be used for the purpose of receiving for treatment any person having tuberculosis in any form or any other like contagious or obnoxious disease, provided, however, that this should not apply to a patient housed temporarily in the premises for the purpose of an operation or the like. The suit was for breach of this restriction. The finding of the Court of Claims showed that no tuberculosis cases as such were received, and that the only ones actually housed were brought in for the purpose of an operation or the like. It was also alleged by the claimant that syphilitic cases were treated in the hospital. The finding of the court was that such cases were not contagious within the meaning of the contract and denied the claim for damages. There is nothing in the record or in the other findings on which we can reach a different conclusion. We deny the motion to remand for further findings and affirm the judgment.

The Dorris Motor Car Company had a contract with the government for the manufacture of Liberty motor governors and petrol air pumps. The contract provided for its cancellation by the government in the event of the termination of the war or in anticipation thereof, upon 30 days' notice and payment for all articles delivered during the contract and the 30-day period. The Ordinance Department notified the contractor to suspend operations under the contract December 14, 1918. The general manager of the claimant discussed the question of termination with the local claims board at St. Louis, which declined to recommend payment for anything unless the suspension was accepted. Thereupon a complete settlement was made, and the amount agreed upon paid. There was a reservation in the settlement, which by no reasonable construction could include the claim here made. The claim was for profit for what might have been made in the 3 days. The Court of Claims held that the claim must fail by reason of the executed settlement and we affirm that judgment.

Valuable time was taken in hearing these cases. After arguments on behalf of the claimants, we declined to hear the other side because the correctness of the judgments of the Court of Claims was clear. It is fortunate for all that, under the Act of February 13, 1925 (Comp. St. Supp. ), judgments of the Court of Claims entered after May 13, 1925, can only be reviewed here after a showing of merits.

UNION INSULTING & CONSTRUCTION CO.
v.
UNITED STATES.
Submitted April 21, 1926.
1
The appellant sued the United States in the Court of Claims for $ for breach of a contract made by it with the United States for certain construction work at the government nitrate plant No. 2 at Muscle Shoals, Ala. The work was done and the contract price paid. The amount here sued for was made up of nine claims for damages for breaches and extras. The Court of Claims found against the claimant on every cause of action alleged. Appeal to this court relates to only two of them.
1
2
The first is for $ and is based on the alleged failure of the United States to furnish a right of way as stipulated in the contract for use in hauling materials to the place of construction.
2
3
After providing that the contractor should furnish certain materials for construction, the contract read:
3
4
'The United States of America to furnish at its present location on the reservation at United States nitrate plant No. 2 all other construction materials, the contractor to perform all necessary labor required in transporting such materials to the proper place of for use in construction, the United States of America at all times to furnish the necessary right of way for ingress and egress to the place of present storage of such materials and the place of ultimate use in construction.
4
5
'The United States government further agrees to furnish to the contractor for the purpose of transporting materials and performing the necessary construction work, such tools and equipment including locomotives, flat cars, dump cars, hoisting engines, locomotive cranes, steam shovels, concrete mixers, air compressors, automobile trucks, clam shell buckets, etc., as are now the property of the United States government and available at United States nitrate plant No. 2, and in such quantities as in the discretion of the constructing quartermaster may be reasonably necessary for such use in construction, and further may be reasonably furnished by the United States government, without material detriment or inconvenience to the United States government. The contractor to accept such equipment as is, and to assume all responsibility for placing such equipment in first-class working condition, and the proper care and maintenance of such equipment, from the time it is turned over to him by the constructing quartermaster.'
5
6
'The right of way furnished by the United States consisted of railroad tracks running from the site of the work to the storage yards. These tracks were used by others, and were not in good condition when the plaintiff submitted its bid, nor were they in any worse condition when it began its work under the contract. The United States did not keep the tracks in good condition during the performance of the contract, but turned them over to the plaintiff for its use with the necessary rolling stock. The plaintiff expended the sum of $for labor in repairing the tracks and $for making repairs to equipment damaged by reason of the defective tracks; it also expended the further sum of $for labor in connection with derailments.'
6
7
What the government agreed to furnish was a right of way, not a railroad for transportation. It agreed that ingress and egress by this right of way should, at all times during the performance of the contract, be given the contractor, and such ingress and egress were afforded it. The defective track on the right of way was evident to the contractor when it made the contract, and the reasonable construction of the contract is that the contractor, in order to avail itself of the right of way, with constant ingress and egress, took over the track as it was as part of the equipment for transportation, just as he did the locomotive and cars, and as it found it, with sole responsibility for placing it in working condition and maintaining it for its use. It is clear that the Court of Claims was right in rejecting this claim.
7
8
The other claim was for damages for delay by the government in arranging for the contractor's start upon the work. The contract provided that the work should be commenced on June 10, 1920, and by that time the contractor had its executive office force at the plant. The contractor was able to begin work on June 13. The delay resulted from the inability to get material issued to the contractor. The actual amount expended for salary and services to the persons kept waiting was $ No complaint and no protest were made by the contractor at the time, and no claim was filed by the contractor until March 14, 1921. The holding of the Court of Claims was that, because it did not satisfactorily appear that the delay was due wholly to the government, and in view of the absence of a claim or protest for nine months thereafter, the claim should be rejected. We concur in this.

Judgment affirmed.

EARLY & DANIEL CO.
v.
UNITED STATES.
Argued April 30, 1926.
1
This is a suit against the United States for $ balance due for hay delivered. Appellant made a contract with the government the 31st of July, by which it agreed to furnish, during the period beginning August 1, and ending September 30, such hay as might be required by the government during July and the first half of August of not to exceed pounds, at pounds, and such hay as might be required during the last half of August and all of September, not exceeding pounds, at 95 cents per pounds, to be delivered f. o. b. cars at Newport News, Va., subject to call of the government in lots not to exceed pounds per lot. The government made calls which the plaintiff filled as follows:
1
pounds, August pounds, August pounds, September pounds, September 12, 1917.
2
3
These calls were all filled without protest, though the later calls were for amounts greater than pounds. When the final and fifth call was made for pounds, the appellant objected that the call was for more pounds of hay than the contract allowed for any one call. That objection was not made until it was too late for the defendant to amend the call. The appellant's vice president then wrote to the government officer in charge that the fifth call was not deemed by the plaintiff to be in accord with the contract, and that the plaintiff did not intend to fill it. Under the terms of the contract, appellant had until November 15th, being three months from the date of the first call, to complete its deliveries. On November 19th, the camp quartermaster wired to the appellant,
3
4
'Amount hay on hand will supply needs to December 4th. Require prompt delivery pounds. Advise at once your action, otherwise must buy in open market.'
4
5
After further exchange of telegrams, plaintiff sent the following telegram to the camp quartermaster under date of November 21, 1917:
5
6
'We will start shipping hay immediately, and in case you need any before arrival will arrange to have Hiden loan us a supply. Want it distinctly understood that we are doing this under protest and are going to put the matter up to proper authorities in Washington; and if they rule in our favor, want settlement at fair market price for amount we overfill. Will you wire C. S. Ruttle, General Agent, D. B. C. & W. Railway, to furnish equipment immediately as we request for hay to ship to you? Answer.' The plaintiff delivered under protest the remaining pounds of hay, Thereafter the plaintiff accepted without protest the sum of $which was all that was due under the contract. The plaintiff then filed this claim for $with the Acting Quartermaster General of the United States Army, with the Auditor for the War Department, with the Secretary of War, with the Comptroller of the Treasury, and with the Board of Contract Adjustment, all of whom in turn decided that the claim could not be paid.
6
7
The appellant had the option of delivering the remainder of the hay under the terms of the contract, or of not delivering it at all, if the contract had been broken. It chose to deliver. It made a protest but that was ignored by the officers of the government, and when the government tendered the contract price, it was accepted by the appellant and without protest. Under such circumstances there is no ground for implying a contract to pay more than the contract price. New York, New Haven & H. R. Co. c. United States, Nelson Co. v. United States, L. Ed.

LEITER et al.
v.
UNITED STATES.
Argued April 19, 1926.
1
This action was brought by the trustees of the Levi Z. Leiter estate, under the Tucker Act,1 to recover rentals under four leases to the United States. The petition was dismissed, on demurrer, for failure to state a cause of action. The appeal was taken in January, 1925.
1
2
The leases which were for space in an office building, were made by the trustees and the Treasury Department, in for terms of four and five years, for the use of the Bureau of War Risk Insurance and other Federal agencies that were subsequently merged, in August, 1921, in the Veterans' Bureau.2 The leases provided for stipulated annual rentals, to be paid in monthly installments. At the time they were made, however, there were no appropriations available for the payment of the rent after the first fiscal year during the term of each lease; and each provided that the term of occupancy should extend to June 30, 1925, 'contingent upon' the making available by Congress of appropriations out of which the rent might be paid after the current fiscal year; and that if such appropriation was not made for any fiscal year, the lease should terminate as of June 30 of the year for which an appropriation was last available.
2
3
On May 29, 1922-before any appropriation had been made out of which the rent could be paid for the next fiscal year-the Director of the Veterans' Bureau gave written notice to the trustees that the premises described in the leases would be 'vacated, relinquished and returned' to them on June 30. On June 1 the trustees wrote to the bureau denying the right of the Government to terminate the leases, and stating that the surrender would not be accepted and claim would be made against the Government for their full period, whether the premises were occupied or not. By an Act of June 12, 1922,3 a lump sum appropriation was made for the expenses of the Bureau, including rentals, for the next fiscal year, commencing July 1. On June 30, however, the Bureau vacated the premises in accordance with its previous notice. All rentals due to and including that date were duly paid. Thereafter, the trustees, being unable to re-lease the premises, presented to the Bureau bills for the rentals for July and succeeding months, the payment of which was refused; and these claims were also disallowed by the Comptroller General. The trustees thereafter instituted the present action to recover the rent claimed to be due from July 1, 1922 to June 30, 1923, inclusive.
3
4
We are of opinion that the demurrer to the petition was rightly sustained.
4
Section 3732 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St. § provides, with certain exceptions not here material, that:
5
6
'No contract or purchase on behalf of the United States shall be made, unless the same is authorized by law or is under an appropriation adequate to its fulfillment. * * *'
6
7
And section of the Revised Statutes, as amended by the Act of February provides that:
7
8
'No. Executive Department or other Government establishment of the United States shall expend, in any one fiscal year, any sum in excess of appropriations made by Congress for that fiscal year, or involve the Government in any contract or other obligation for the future payment of money in excess of such appropriations unless such contract or obligation is authorized by law.'
8
9
It is not alleged or claimed that these loases were made under any specific authority of law. And since at the time they were made there was no appropriation available for the payment or rent after the first fiscal year, it is clear that in so far as their terms extended beyond that year they were in violation of the express provisions of the Revised Statutes; and, being to that extent executed without authority of law, they created no binding obligation against the United States after the first year. See Chase v. United States, L. Ed. Sutton v. United States, L. Ed. United States v. Doullut, and Abbott v. United States (C. C.) A lease to the Government for a term of years when entered into under an appropriation available for but one fiscal year, is binding on the Government only for that year. McCollum v. United States, Smoot v. United States, And it is plain that to make it binding for any subsequent year, it is necessary, not only that on appropriation be made available for the payment of the rent, but that the Government, by its duly authorized officers, affirmatively continue the lease for such subsequent year; thereby, in effect, by the adoption of the original lease, making a new lease under the authority of such appropriation for the subsequent year. This conclusion is in entire accord with Bradley v. United States, There, a building having been leased to the Post Office Department for three years at a stipulated annual rental of $ subject to an appropriation by Congress for payment of the rental, and Congress, before the expiration of the second of $only for a specific appropriation of $only for the payment of rent for the third year, and the Department having continued to occupy the building for the third year, it was held the lessor could recover only the amount thus specifically appropriated for the occupancy of the building during the third year, and not the full amount of the rent stipulated in the lease. In the present case, in accordance with the notice of the Veterans' Bureau that it would surrender the premises on June 30, 1922, the Government did not occupy the premises after that date. That is, although a lump sum appropriation had meanwhile been made for the rental expenses of the Veterans' Bureau for the next fiscal year-in which no reference was made to these specific leases-the leases were not continued under this appropriation for the next year, either by a specific agreement to that effect or by the occupation of the premises. So, the Government did not become liable for the payment of rent after the surrender of the premises.

271 U.S. 212
UNITED STATES
v.
MINNESOTA MUT. INV. CO.
Submitted May 6, 1926.
1
The Minnesota Mutual Investment Company is a corporation of South Dakota, doing business in Colorado. It sued the United States for $ under the Tucker Act (Judicial Code, § 24, par. ). Its claim arises under the following circumstances: In a cause pending in the United States District Court for Colorado, the Investment Company was plaintiff, and McGirr and others were defendants. The plaintiff was required to place in the registery of the court $ which the clerk of the court immediately deposited in the First National Bank of Denver, Colo., designated by the court as one of its depositaries. The money remained in the bank to the credit of the court from June 7, 1918, until May 6, 1920, when it was returned to the Investment Company. During that period the bank paid interest on this deposit of 2 per cent. per annum, semiannually into the United States Treasury for the use of the government. The petition alleges that for a long series of years prior to this, interest paid by the bank on such court funds had been added to the deposit for the benefit of the party adjudged to own it, but that shortly before this deposit the Secretary of the Treasury, by regulation, required all United States depositaries having court funds to pay interest at 2 per cent. to the Treasurer of the United States for its use.
1
2
The petition avers that the United States was not interested in the sum of money so deposited, had no right, title, or interest therein, directly or indirectly, and that the interest so paid was and is the property of the plaintiff, and was received by the United States for the use and benefit of the plaintiff, and judgment was asked therefor.
2
3
The United States filed a demurrer to the complaint, which was overruled. It then answered alleging that the United States, through its proper officers, had entered into a contract concerning the payment of interest upon all government deposits, including the court funds, carried with the bank by virtue of its designation as a depositary of the United States, under the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury under authority conferred upon him by the laws of the United States; that this contract considered of an offer made on behalf of the United States and its acceptance by the First National Bank by its President, and that accordingly $was paid to the United States by the bank; that in consideration of such payment the United States allowed the bank the use of all government deposits held on deposit, allowed the bank the prestige and advertising connected with its handling of such government deposits, kept safe in its custody the collateral security pledged by the bank to secure the deposits, and supervised the depositary in all matters in connection with the deposit. Accompanying the answer was the correspondence claimed to embody the contract between the United States and the bank. A demurrer to the answer of the defendant was sustained, and the judgment for $followed. Direct appeal to this court was allowed to the United States under the Tucker Act (Act of March Stat. ), because taken before the taking effect of the Act of February .
3
4
Section of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St. § provides:
4
5
'All moneys paid into any court of the United States, or received by the officers thereof, in any cause pending or adjudicated in such court, shall be forthwith deposited with the Treasurer, an Assistant Treasurer, or a designated depositary of the United States, in the name and to the credit of such court: Provided, that nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the delivery of any such money upon security, according to agreement of parties, under the direction of the court.'
5
6
Rule 20 of the Rules of the District Court of Colorado contains the following:
6
7
'1. All moneys brought into court shall be paid to the clerk of the court, unless the court shall otherwise direct, and when not immediately paid to the party entitled, be deposited by said clerk, in his name of office, with such depositary as may be designated by law, or by the court, when no place is so designated. The amount so received, the purpose for which it was paid into court, together with the fact of the deposit, as herein provided, shall be noted by the clerk in the civil or criminal dockets of the court in the particular cause in which it is received. All interest paid on said deposits shall become a part thereof.'
7
8
Section of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St. § provides that the Secretary of the Treasury may make rules and regulations relative to public moneys and officers concerned therewith. Section of the Revised Statutes, as amended by later acts (Comp. St. § , provides in effect that all national bank associations designated for that purpose by the Secretary of the Treasury shall be depositaries of public money under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary and they are to perform all such reasonable duties as depositaries of public money as may be required of them. The Secretary is to require them to give satisfactory security, by the deposit of United States bonds, for the safe keeping of the public money deposited with them.
8
9
The court below found that the Secretary of the Treasury had no power under these two sections to direct national banks to pay interest on deposits of court founds to the United States and that his authority to make such a regulation for interest extended only to public moneys, and not to court funds belonging to the parties to the litigation awaiting adjudication as to ownership or proper disposition. The conclusion of the court was that the United States had therefore received interest which should have been paid to the defendant in error, the Investment Company, and which it may recover from the United States.
9
10
But the Solicitor General argues that even if the United States had no right to collect the interest from the bank, no cause of action was created in favor of the Investment Company against the United States for this illegal collection, that there was no contract of the government, express or implied, by reason of that collection to pay it to the Investment Company, and that without this, no recovery can be had. This seems to us to be sound reasoning. An implied contract in order to give the Court of Claims or a district court under the Tucker Act jurisdiction to give judgment against the government must be one implied in fact and not one based merely on equitable considerations and implied in law. Merritt v. United States, L. Ed. Tempel v. United States, L. Ed. Sutton v. United States, L. Ed. There is nothing in the averments in the pleadings in this case to show that the officers of the government collected this interest or that it was received into the treasury for the benefit of the Investment Company.

11
The judgment is reversed.

271 U.S. 263
UNITED STATES
v.
WYCKOFF PIPE & CREOSOTING CO., Inc.
Argued April 29, 1926.
1
The Wyckoff Pipe & Creosoting Company, Inc., contracted with the United States, in December, 1917, to lay creosoted wood block floors in Navy Yard buildings at Norfolk, Va., furnishing all necessary labor and materials. On a part of the job the contractor was to begin the work immediately after delivery of a copy of the contract. This part was to be completed within 30 days thereafter. On other parts, work was to be deferred until such time as the government was ready to proceed. These parts were to be finished within 43 days from the dates on which they were begun. The flooring was to be set in a concrete base which was to be laid promptly by the government. The contractor prepared itself immediately to perform the contract. Among other things, it purchased the lumber and creosote oil needed for the job. Long delays by the government in furnishing the concrete bases prevented performance by the contractor. Thus more than two years elapsed before the work was completed. The contractor was without fault.
1
2
The government's delays confessedly caused the contractor some loss. For the loss so suffered the government was confessedly liable. It made payment at the fixed contract rate of $per square yard-and paid an additional amount, also provided by the contract, equal to 50 per cent. of the estimated increase in the labor cost. It paid nothing otherwise on account of the damages caused by its delay. To recover compensation for the loss suffered, this suit on the contract was brought in the Court of Claims in January, 1923. That court assessed the damages at $ and for that amount it entered judgment, without an opinion, on June The case is here on appeal under section of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. § . The only question presented is whether there was error in the measure of damages adopted.
2
3
The findings of fact recite that the contractor, in reserving its right to claim damages for extras by reason of the long unanticipated delay, had enumerated as items of the proposed claim extra labor on account of the advance in the scale of wages, extra expense by reason of renewal premiums on surety company bonds, additional freight rates on sand and other material, additional cost of sand, additional cost of creosote oil, storage, insurance, and carrying charges 'on a large stock of lumber purchased for the account of your contract and carried in our yard for a space of between one and two years.' The findings also recite that the record does not disclose by items the amount of extra expense incurred by the contractor by reason of the lengthy delay in the performance of the work. The court made no finding or estimate of the loss so incurred. It found merely that the increase in the prevailing market price of lumber from the time that used was bought by the contractor until it was actually employed on the job was $ that the increase in the prevailing market price of the creosote oil required from the time it was purchased for the job until it actually was so used amounted to $ that the reasonable value of the contract work per square yard at the time it was actually performed was, for a part $ for a part $ and for the rest $ and that the reasonable value of the whole work at the time it was done by the contractor, based upon prices then paid by the government on other work then done at the Navy Yard, was $in excess of the amount which the contractor had received. It was for this sum of $ plus an item of $about which there is no dispute, that the Court of Claims entered its judgment of $.
3
4
The government contends that recovery cannot be had on the contract for the higher market value of the work at the time it was actually performed; that the correct measure of damages for its delay is the loss actually sustained by the contractor as the result of the delay (United States v. Smith, United States v. Mueller, L. Ed. Ripley v. United States, L. Ed. ; that the increase in the market value of materials purchased for use on the contract cannot be deemed a loss; and that to assess damages on the basis of the value of the work at the time it was performed was, in effect, to make a new contract for the parties or to allow recovery as upon quantum meruit. The contention is, in our opinion, well founded.
4
5
The contractor urges that the long delay was a breach which would have justified it in terminating the contract and refusing to do the work except under a new one at an increased price. But, despite a contention to the contrary, it did not do this. It completed the work under the contract as originally made. It did not attempt to make a new contract, or to modify the existing one. It sought merely to reserve its right to make a claim for the damages resulting from the government's delay. After completing performance it brought this suit declaring on the original contract.
5
6
The contractor urges also that, because of the delay, it might have used the supplies purchased on another job, receiving on that their then market value, or might have sold them and taken the incidental profit due to the rise in values; and that, if it had done either and had been obliged later to purchase new supplies at the higher market values in order to perform the government job, the increased cost would have been recoverable as a loss; and that, as the amount of this increase has been found, the recovery should be sustained at least to that extent. The contractor's contentions, however, ignore the rule that damages for delay are limited to the actual losses incurred. The contractor elected to hold itself in readiness to perform its contract and to this end to retain both the lumber and the creosote oil. The carrying charges thus incurred are an allowable item of damage; but these were not shown. It may even be that in the event of a use or resale of the supplies, if under the circumstances such a course of action was open to the contractor, the profits made would have been available in reduction of damages. Compare Erie County Natural Gas & Fuel Co. v. Carroll ( But clearly it cannot now charge as a loss profits which it might have made if it had sold the supplies in the market or used them on another job.
6
7
It is argued that the Court of Claims is under no obligation when assessing damages to specify the elements of the calculation by which it arrives at its results; that itemization is often impossible, and that, like a jury, the court may make an estimate and return such sum as the damages recoverable (compare United States v. Smith; and that, accepting the rule that damages are to be limited to actual loss, the award of the lower court is to be regarded as an estimate of such loss. But, in the case at bar, the court did not pursue that course. It made no estimate of the loss suffered. It found merely the increase in value of the work at the time it was performed and the increase in value of the material during the period of the delay. Then it found and concluded, as a matter of law, that the excess of the reasonable value of the work at the time it was done over the amount paid therefor, was recoverable as damages. This was error.
7
8
The judgment must be reversed. As there are no findings from which the amount of the loss can be determined, the case is remanded for further proceedings.

9
Reversed.

v.
PITTSBURGH & W. V. RY. CO. et al. PITTSBURGH & W. V. RY. CO. et al. v. UNITED STATES.
Argued March 11, 1926.

The United States appeals from a judgment in favor of plaintiffs for $per cent. tax on their consolidated income for Plaintiffs have taken a cross-appeal, and insist that the court erred in failing to add their expenses and attorney's fees.

2
The Pittsburgh Company owned all the capital stock of the West Side Company. Their railroads were taken over by the President and were operated under federal control from January 1, 1918, to March 1, 1920. They failed to make any agreement with the Railroad Administration as to just compensation to be paid them for the use of their properties until final settlement was made July 1, 1921. At that time there was paid to plaintiffs $in addition to $which had been paid on account in January, 1920. And the Director General assumed, in respect of the payment of taxes, the obligations which are specified in section 6 of the standard form contract authorized by the Federal Control Act, March (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. a).

Plaintiffs made returns and paid the full amount of federal taxes for respectively. These included nothing received as compensation for the use of their properties. The Director General reimbursed them to the extent of the normal taxes. Plaintiffs made their return and paid their taxes for Their income in that year in cluded the $paid on account. As federal control ended March 1, the Director General declined to allow more than one-sixth of the tax. The plaintiffs' taxable net income for This, because of deductions allowed, was less than the payment at final settlement. In upon plaintiffs' insistence, the Bureau of Internal Revenue held that the compensation received in 1921 for the use of their properties during federal control was income for that year, and that none of it was attributable to the period of federal control. Subsequently plaintiffs called on the Railroad Administration for payment of $per cent. of their income.

Section 1 of the Federal Control Act required that every such agreement should provide that federal taxes under the Revenue Act of , or acts in addition thereto or in amendment thereof, commonly called was taxes, 'assessed for the period of federal control beginning January first, nineteen hundred and eighteen, or any part of such period' should be paid by the carrier out of its own funds or should be charged against or deducted from the just compensation; that other taxes assessed 'for the period of federal control or any part thereof,' should be paid out of revenues derived from operations while under federal control.

The authorized standard form of contract, section 6(a), provided that all war taxes assessed against the company under the Revenue Act of or any act in addition thereto or in amendment thereof should be paid by the company. And paragraph (c) provided that the Director General should either pay out of revenues derived from railway operations 'during the period of federal control,' or save the company harmless from all taxes lawfully assessed under federal or other governmental authority 'for any part of said period,' except the taxes and assessments for which provision was made in paragraph (a).

The tax of 2 per cent. imposed by section 10 of the Revenue Act of was known as the normal tax. The additional tax of 4 per cent. imposed by section 4 of the Revenue Act of j) was a war tax. Section a) of the Revenue Act of (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. nn) provided that, in lieu of the 2 per cent. normal tax and the 4 per cent. war tax, there should be paid for the calendar year a tax of 12 per cent. of net incomes and for each year thereafter 10 per cent. Section b) provided that, for the purpose of the Federal Control Act, five sixths of the 12 per cent. tax and four-fifths of the 10 per cent. tax should be 'treated as levied by an act in amendment of title I of the Revenue Act of ' Thus, it was plainly indicated that the tax to be borne by the Director General was the 2 per cent. The amount in controversy is 2 per cent. of the income tax for It was assessed under the Revenue Act of that year (, which provided that, in lieu of taxes imposed by the act of there should be paid 10 per cent. of net incomes for per cent. for each year thereafter. The divisions between the Director General and the corporation, prescribed by subdivision (b) of section of the act of applied only to taxes imposed by subdivision (a) of that section. No divisions were prescribed by the act of Those made by the earlier act were not intended to apply to taxes imposed by the act of and neither of them would produce the two per cent. normal tax if applied to per cent., the rate for each year after The provisions of section 6 of the standard form of contract, the Federal Control Act and Revenue Acts are to be read together. When this is done, it is clear that the obligation of the Director General to bear the normal income taxes of the corporations did not go beyond those assessed for the period of federal control. That obligation was not held down to the normal tax on amounts received as compensation for the use of their properties, but extended to the normal tax assessed for that period on all incomes taxed without regard to source. But it cannot be held to extend to taxes on incomes for without excluding from consideration the provisions of the Federal Control Act and standard agreement clearly limiting the obligation to taxes assessed for the period of federal control. The meaning of these provisions is plain. There is no room for construction. The period in which the assessments were made governed. The sources of taxable incomes were not regarded. It would be contrary to the plain language of the statute and contract to hold the United States liable for any part of the taxes for Plaintiffs were not entitled to recover.

Their cross-appeal depends upon a provision contained in section 6 of the standard contract binding the Director General to pay or save the company harmless from expense of suits respecting the classes of taxes payable by the Director General under the agreement. As the tax was not so payable, plaintiffs take nothing by their cross-appeal.

271 U.S. 536
GOLTRA
v.
WEEKS, Secretary of War, et al.
Argued April 27, 28, 1926.
1
This was a suit in equity brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, and reaches here from the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit by certiorari. The general purpose of the bill filed by Edward F. Goltra, petitioner here, was to enjoin the seizure of a fleet of towboats and barges on the Mississippi river which had been held by him as lessee. It charged that the Secretary of War, the Chief of Engineers, and Col. T. Q. Ashburn, Chief Inland and Coastwise Waterways Service, were engaged in a conspiracy unlawfully to deprive him of the boats. He sought to enjoin the threatened seizure of them and to have those of them which had already been taken restored to his possession.
1
2
The lease to Goltra was made May 28, 1919, by Gen. Black, Chief of Engineers, as the lessor, by direction of the Secretary of War, acting for the United States. It leased 19 barges, nearing completion, and 3 or 4 towboats, not yet constructed, for a term of five years from the date the first towboat or barge was delivered to the lessee. The lessee covenanted to operate as a common carrier the whole fleet on the Mississippi river and its tributaries for the period of the lease and of any renewals thereof, transporting iron ore, coal, and other commodities at rates not in excess of the prevailing rail tariffs, and at not less than the prevailing rail tariffs without the consent of the Secretary of War. The lessee was to pay all operating expenses of the fleet, and to maintain during the term each towboat and barge of the fleet in good operating condition, to the satisfaction of the lessor. The salvage earned by any of the fleet was to be for the benefit of the United States, after deducting expenses. The net earnings above operating expenses and maintenance for each ton of cargo were to be turned over by the lessee to the Secretary of War every 90 days, for deposit to his credit in the Treasury, until the net earnings equaled the full amount of the cost of the several vessels, plus interest on the cost of 4 per cent. per annum, and then for deposit in St. Louis banks, to be held for the fulfillment of the terms of the lease. The lessee was to keep accurate detailed accounts of all tonnage moved, and all moneys received, and his operating expenses, subject to the inspection of the lessor or his representatives, and the overhead expenses were to be subject to the approval of the lessor, and any items objected to were to be referred to the Secretary of War, whose decision was to be final. Within three months prior to the expiration of the lease, or of any period of renewal, or sooner, if so desired by the lessee, a board was to appraise the value of the fleet, and the lessee was given the option of purchasing the fleet by the fund from the net earnings and by 15 promissory notes running for 15 years, the title of the property to remain in the United States until the payment of the whole of the purchase price of the property.
2
3
Section 8 of the lease, the important provision in this case, reads as follows:
3
4
'The lessor reserves the right to inspect the plant, fleet, and work at any time to see that all the said terms and conditions of this lease are fulfilled, and that the crews and other employees are promptly paid, monthly or oftener; and noncompliance, in his judgment, with any of the terms or conditions, will justify his terminating the lease and returning the plant and said barges and towboats to the lessor, and all moneys in the Treasury or in bank to the credit of the Secretary of War shall be deemed rentals earned by and due to the lessor for the use of said vessels.'
4
5
There was a supplemental agreement in 1921, approved by the Secretary of War, made by Lansing H. Beach, the Chief of Engineers, who had then succeeded Chief of Engineers Black. This made provision for the construction of additional facilities for the use of the fleet and brought them within the terms of the original contract.
5
6
The bill set out that there was delay in the construction and delivery of the fleet, and that both parties after the war found difficulty in performing their undertakings; that, after the making of the lease, the plaintiff had secured a good many contracts for the shipment of commodities of different kinds-of oil from New Orleans to Illinois, coal from Kentucky to St. Louis and Manganese from New Orleans to St. Louis; that the rate which he arranged for was 80 per cent. of the prevailing rail rate; that, when he applied to the Secretary of War, he could not obtain permission to transport some of his commodities at a proper rate; that conditions were imposed requiring the consent of officers in charge of the Mississippi Warrior, another enterprise of the government, to Goltra's rate, and that by reason thereof it was impossible for him to operate as a common carrier; that by the acts of the Secretary of War the plaintiff was wrongfully prevented by the lessor from carrying out the terms and conditions of the contract; that John W. Weeks and T. Q. Ashburn, named as defendants, acting in combination, wrongfully undertook to declare the contracts terminated, and on March 3, 1923, demanded from the plaintiff the immediate possession of the boats without warrant of law, and wrongfully and unlawfully threatened to take them by force, caused some of the towboats and barges to be actually seized, and were threatening to take them all, and that unless restrained would do so; that the plaintiff had no adequate remedy at law for the redress of the wrongs complained of. He therefore asked a temporary restraining order to be granted immediately, and a restoration of the fleet to him, and a rule on the defendants to show cause why a temporary injunction should not issue. A rule to show cause was issued on March 25, 1923, on defendant.
6
7
It appeared that the whole fleet had been taken over by Col. Ashburn under an order of the Secretary of War. The taking over was on Sunday, and there was a purpose on the part of Col. Ashburn, anticipating an injunction, to remove such of the fleet as was in St. Louis across the river, to be out of the jurisdiction of the Missouri District Court. All of the defendants filed returns to the rule, setting out defenses. A hearing was had on the motion for a temporary injunction, evidence was taken, and the District Court found that the fleet had been improperly seized and should be restored to the plaintiffs and the defendants be enjoined from any attempt to resume possession until a final hearing of the case.
7
8
The defendants the sought a writ of prohibition out of this court to prevent the further consideration of the cause by the District Court. Ex parte United States, L. Ed. The leave to file a petition for prohibition was denied, on the ground that the remedy by appeal from the District Court was adequate.
8
9
The evidence shows that in March, 1921, Goltra applied to have his rates as a common carrier fixed at 80 per cent. of the prevailing rail rates, and he was allowed from that time on until March, 1922, to make those rates. In March, 1922, the Secretary of War notified him that he could not approve any operation on the lower Mississippi entering into competition with the government Mississippi Warrior line, and that he could not approve an 80 per cent. rate there. In April, 1922, Goltra objected to the limitation, saying that he had obligated himself to transport coal from Kentucky and managanese and oil from New Orleans at this rate. Thereupon the Secretary of War advised him that the rate on the lower Mississippi must be raised from 80 per cent. to per cent. of the rail tariffs for the future, thus allowing him to complete the contracts of transportation already entered into, of which he had written. By letter of May 25, 1922, he was allowed a rate not less than 80 per cent. of the rail rates for many different commodities. The Secretary assured him that if he decided to operate his boats on the upper Mississippi he was authorized to carry all commodities at not less than 80 per cent., and that the officers of the Warrior Service had been instructed to co-operate with him to the fullest extent in making his fleet a success.
9
10
After a year, on March 13, 1923, the Secretary of War, in view of the little use he had made of the fleet, sent the following notice to Goltra:
10
11
'Pursuant to the right reserved in paragraph supplement thereto dated May 26, 1921, between you and the United States, for the operation as a common carrier of a fleet of 4 towboats and 19 barges, and the erection of unloading facilities, you are hereby notified that in my judgment you have not complied with the terms and conditions of said contract, in that you have failed to operate the said towboats and barges as a common carrier, and in other particulars.
11
12
'I therefore declare the said contract and the supplement thereto terminated. You are hereby directed, upon the receipt of this notice, immediately to deliver possession of the said towboats and barges, and any unloading facilities erected pursuant to the supplemental contract, and paid for by funds of the United States, to Col. T. Q. Ashburn, Chief Inland and Coastwise Waterways Service, who will deliver this notice, and who is instructed and authorized to receive and receipt for the property herein mentioned.'
12
 the Chief of Engineers sent a similar letter to Goltra. Goltra acknowledged receipt of the Secretary's letter, but protested against the action.
13
14
The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the action of the District Court in restoring the fleet to Goltra and enjoining the defendants, and held that the motion to dismiss and to quash the temporary restraining order should have been granted, on the ground that the United States was a necessary party and could not be sued in such an action.
14
15
We cannot agree with the Curcit We cannot agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the United States was a necessary party to the bill. The bill was suitably framed to secure the relief from an alleged conspiracy of the defendants without lawful right to take away from the plaintiff the boats of which by lease or charter he alleged that he had acquired the lawful possession and enjoyment for a term of five years. He was seeking equitable aid to avoid a threatened trespass upon that property by persons who were government officers. If it was a trespass, then the officers of the government should be restrained whether they professed to be acting for the government or not. Neither they nor the government which they represent could trespass upon the property of another, and it is well settled that they may be stayed in their unlawful proceeding by a court of competent jurisdiction, even though the United States for whom they may profess to act is not a party and can not be made one. By reason of their illegality, their acts or threatened acts are personal and derive no official justification from their doing them in asserted agency for the government. The point is fully covered by Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, L. Ed. In that case, the complainant owned an island in the Ohio river around which the duly authorized officers of Pennsylvania had located a harbor line, which by statute was declared to be forever firm and stable. The Secretary of War changed the harbor lines in such a way as to cross the complainant's land within the state harbor line which had never been, as complainant alleged, part of the navigable waters of the United States. The bill averred that the Secretary of War proposed to institute criminal prosecutions with heavy penalties against complainant for his proposed erection of buildings on his own land. It was objected on demurrer that this was a suit against the United States and must be dismissed for lack of its presence as a party. This court declined to yield to the contention as a ground for dismissing the bill. The ruling is so comprehensive, and refers to so many authorities, and is so apt, that we quote the language at pages S. Ct. :
15
16
'If the conduct of the defendant, constitutes an unwarrantable interference with property of the complainant, its resort to equity for protection is not to be defeated upon the ground that the suit is one against the United States. The exemption of the United States from suit does not protect its officers from personal liability to persons whose rights of property they have wrongfully invaded. Little v. Barreme, L. Ed. 243); United States v. Lee, L. Ed. ; Belknap v. Schild, L. Ed. ; Tindal v. Wesley, L. Ed. ; Scranton v. Wheeler. And in case of an injury threatened by his illegal action, the officer cannot claim immunity from injunction process. The principle has frequently been applied with respect to state officers seeking to enforce unconstitutional enactments. Osborn v. Bank of United States, L. Ed. 204); Davis v. Gray; Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, L. Ed. ; Scott v. Donald, L. Ed. ; Smyth v. Ames, L. Ed. ; Ex parte Young, L. Ed. Ann. Cas. ; Ludwig v. Western Union Telegraph Co., L. Ed. Herndon v. C., R. I. & P. Ry. Co., L. Ed. ; Hopkins v. Clemson College, L. Ed. And it is equally applicable to a federal officer acting in excess of his authority, or under an authority not validly conferred. Noble v. Union River Logging R. R. Co., L. Ed. ; (American) School of Margnetic Healing v. McAnnulty. 
16
17
'The complainant did not ask the court to interfere with the official discretion of the Secretary of War, but challenged his authority to do the things of which complaint was made. The suit rests upon the charge of abuse of power, and its merits must be determined accordingly; it is not a suit against the United States.' It is sought to avoid the application of this to the present case by reference to the later case of Wells v. Roper, L. Ed. We think it clearly distinguishable. Wells had a contract with the Postmaster General, acting for the United States, by which Roper agreed for four years to furnish, for use in collecting and delivering the mail, automobiles and chauffeurs at a stipulated compensation. On provision of the contract was that any or all of the equipments contracted for might be discountinued at any time upon 90 days' notice by the Postmaster General. Later Congress authorized that offical in his discretion to use an appropriation to buy and maintain automobiles for operating an experimental combined screen wagon and city collection and delivery service, and in order to do this he deemed it necessary to discontinue the service of the plaintiff, and gave the latter seasonable notice of the cancellation of the contract. The suit was a bill in equity to enjoin the Postmaster General from annulling the contract and interfering between the United States and the plaintiff in the performance and execution of the contract. The bill was dismissed on the ground that it was a suit against the United States. That which the bill sought to restrain was not a trespass upon the property of the plaintiff. The automobiles of the plaintiff were not to be taken away from him by the government officer. What the officer was doing was merely exercising the authority intrusted to him by law for the benefit of the government in annulling a contract which involved no change of possession or title to property. To enjoin the officers' action was in effect enforcement by specific performance of a contract against the United States. It was an affirmative remedy sought against the government, which though in form merely restrictive of an officer was really mandatory against the sovereign. The difference between an injunction against the illegal seizure of property lawfully possessed and against the cancellation of a contract which involved no change of possession is manifest.
17
18
As the United States was not a necessary party to the bill, the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals in dismissing the bill and quashing the injunction for lack of its presence as such cannot be sustained.
18
19
Coming now to the merits, however, we think that the District Court erred in granting the temporary injunction because on the facts disclosed the lease was finally terminated by the decision of the Secretary of War and the Chief of Engineers, communicated to Goltra under section 8 of the contract. It is very clear that under that section, Goltra agreed that the lease should be terminated and that the plant and barges returned to the lessor, if the lessor decided that in his judgment there had been noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the lease. It appears from the evidence that during the season from July 15, 1922, when Goltra got the boats, they were not in use, but were tied up, except for the transportation of two comparatively small cargoes. The bill itself admits that Goltra did not fulfill his covenant to operate as a common carrier. He says he was prevented from doing so by the Secretary's refusal to give him the rates he wished. The contract expressly forbade rates exceeding the prevailing rail rates and forbade rates less than the rail rates except by consent of the Secretary.
19
20
The stipulation that the lessor, the Chief of Engineers, could terminate the lease if in his judgment Goltra was not complying with the obligations of the contract, did not require for its exercise that the Chief of Engineers, or the Secretary, should hold a court and have a hearing to determine the question of compliance. Goltra was given a notice, March 4th of the termination. He answered March 8th, but he tendered no facts upon which either the Secretary or the Chief of Engineers could base any different conclusion from that already reached from the failure of Goltra to fulfill his obligations. Both the Secretary and the Chief of Engineers were fully advised of what Goltra did and did not do under the contract.
20
21
The cases leave no doubt that such a provision for termination of a contract is valid, unless there is an absence of good faith in the exercise of the judgment. Here nothing of the kind is shown. Such a stipulation may be a harsh one, or an unwise one, but it is valid and binding if entered into. It is often illustrated in government contracts in which the determination of a vital issue under the contract is left to the decision of a government officer. Kihlberg v. United States, Sweeney v. United States, L. Ed. United States v. Gleason, L. Ed. United States v. Mason & Hangar Co., L. Ed. United States v. Hurley; Martinsburg R. R. Co. v. March. 
21
22
Nor does the circumstance that as in this case the lessor whose judgment is to prevail is a party to the contract alter the legal result. Of course the Chief Engineer is not the real party in interest. He is a professional expert, as such was designated as lessor, and is really acting only as an agent for the government. But, even if this were a stipulation between private individuals, judgment of one of the parties on such an issue would be in the absence of bad faith conclusive. There are many cases where the contract makes the satisfaction of one of the parties in respect to compliance the condition precedent to fulfillment, and good faith is all that is required to justify rejection of work or product tendered. Some of them present a convincing analogy to the case. In Magee v. Scott & Holston Lumber Co., the defendant made a contract with a Duluth tug owner to tow feet of saw logs to its mill at Duluth from the north shore of Lake Superior. The contract contained a provision that, in case the services should not be satisfactory, the defendant reserved the privilege of terminating the contract at any time. The defendant terminated the contract, because of plaintiff's delay. The evidence being clear that the decision was honest, the court directed a verdict and the action was sustained by the Supreme Court.
22
23
Much has been said on behalf of the government with reference to the special power of a government officer to act in such a case and without judicial assistance forcibly to repossess himself of government property, which we might find it difficult to agree with but which it is unnecessary for us to consider. Our conclusion is based on the law as it is administered between private persons. Col. Ashburn took possession without notification to Goltra other than that which had been communicated to him by the Secretary of War terminating the contract, and it is clear from the evidence that Col. Ashburn was anxious to take possession of the property before a writ of injunction could be sued out by Goltra, and that he sought to take the fleet out of the jurisdiction of the court where he feared the injunction. He was not directed to make the seizure by the Secretary of War against the opposition of Goltra, but in such case he was directed to resort to legal proceedings. He stands upon the statement that he took possession without violence and therefore was rightly in possession when the order of the court was served. He took possession, whether he took it violently or not. Concede that he did it with a show of force which was coercive. Concede that it was seizure without process and wrong. But, even so, an injunction looks only to the future. At the hearing it was made plain that Goltra was not entitled to the possession, and the court-one of equity-would not go through the idle form of restoring the property to Goltra by way of correcting the colonel's wrong, and then requiring a redelivery to the lessor.
23
24
As it is, the court has taken over the fleet and given it to Goltra under bond, and the only issue that remains is whether the injunction and the restoration should be maintained or the injunction be dissolved and the fleet returned to the lessor.
24
25
On an appeal from a temporary injunction it often happens that where there is a balance of convenience and doubt as to the issue, the status quo under the restraining order and the restoration should be maintained until a final hearing; but in this case, in the court hearing it, the issue was fully treated as if on final hearing. The right of the lessor to take over the fleet under section 8 of the contract, unless there was fraud in the judgment of termination by the Chief of Engineers, the lessor, of which we have found no evidence, is clear. We think, therefore, the injunction should be dissolved, and the fleet restored to the lessor.
25
26
The claim that the petitioner has been deprived of his property without due process of law has no substance as a reason for sustaining the temporary injunction appealed from. He has had and is having due process in this very proceeding and on that issue, the decision must go against him whether the taking possession of the boats by Col. Ashburn was warranted or not.
26
27
If Col. Ashburn committed a breach of the peace, or illegally injured any person in his taking possession, he is responsible to proper authority and to the person injured, but that does not affect the rights of the lessor under this lease, or the vindication of them in this review.
27
28
The reversal of the injunction of the District Court by the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed, and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.
28
29
The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS:
29
30
Theoretically, everybody in this land is subject to the law. But of what value is the theory, if performances like those revealed by this record go unrebuked? An army officer, having inflated himself into judge and executioner, decided that a fleet of towboats and barges lying in the Mississippi river at St. Louis ought no longer to remain in the custody of a private citizen, who held possession of them under a solemn lease and contract of sale from the United States, and who, in order to make them operative, had expended upon them $of his own money. Then, waiting until a Sunday arrived, he proceeded to grab the vessels by force and endeavored to run them beyond the jurisdiction of the court.
30
31
Action like that is familiar under autocracies, but the prevalent idea has been that we live under a better system.
31
32
The trial court, after taking an ample indemnifying bond, issued a temporary injunction, requiring that possession of the vessels be restored and remain as before the seizure until the rights of all parties could be properly considered and determined. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this interlocutory order, and from its decree the cause came here by certiorari.
32
33
As a fitting climax to the high-handed measures pursued by the officer, special counsel for the United States appeared at our bar and gravely announced:
33
34
'Where the executive power has pronounced its finding or judgment within its proper sphere of action, a judicial judgment is not necessary to the enforcement of the executive one, for the reason that all the compulsive power of the government is in the executive department and may be exercised by it in execution of its own processes and judgment, just as it is exercised by it in the execution of judicial process and judgment.'
34
35
It is easy enough for us to smile at such stuff, but, unfortunately, the evil effects are not dissipated by gentle gestures. There should be condemnation forceful enough to prevent repetition so long as men have eyes to read.
35
36
In the Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Sanborn presented a well-considered dissenting opinion and pointed out that the only judicable question before that court was whether or not the order for the injunction and the record disclosed an unlawful, improvident or abusive use of the sound discretion which the trial judge was required to exercise. And see Ex parte United States, L. Ed. He could find no such abuse, and neither can I. The trial court did no more than the circumstances permitted. We should approve its action with commendation of the impelling courage and good sense.

271 U.S. 609
JAYBIRD MINING CO.
v.
WEIR, County Treasurer.
Argued April 29, 1926.
1
The mining company sued in the district court of Ottawa county to recover a tax of $paid under protest. The county treasurer demurred to the petition asserting that if failed to state a cause of action. The demurrer was overruled, and judgment was given for the plaintiff. On appeal to the highest court of the state the judgment was reversed. The case is here on writ of error. Section Judicial Code (Comp. St. § .
1
2
Briefly the facts are these: September 26, 1896, pursuant to the Act of March there was issued to Hum-bah-wat-tah Quapaw, a Quapaw Indian, a patent for an allotment of 40 acres of land in Ottawa county. The patent contained restrictions against alienation for 25 years, and by the Act of March that period was extended for an additional 25 years. The land is owned by the heirs of the allottee. The company has a mining lease on the restricted land on terms which provide for the payment of royalties or a percentage of the gross proceeds derived from the sale of ores minded. The amount sued for is an ad valorem tax assessed by the county officials under section Compiled Statutes (Okl.) of on lead and zinc ores mined by the company in 1920, and which were in its bins on the land January 1, 1921. This tax is in addition to a gross production tax paid to the state auditor. It was assessed on the ores in mass, and the royalties or equitable interests of the Indians had not been paid or segregated. Prior to the production of the ores taxed, the Secretary of the Interior determined the Indian owners to be incapable of managing their property and assumed control of it in their behalf. Act of June Since that time, the royalties have been paid directly to the secretary.
2
3
The Quapaw Indians are under the guardianship of the United States. The land and Indian owners are bound by restrictions specified in the patent and the acts referred to. It is the duty and established policy of the government to protect these dependents in respect of their property. The restrictions imposed are in furtherance of that policy. United States v. Noble, L. Ed. Goodrum v. Buffalo, The lessee is an agency or instrumentality employed by the government for the development and use of the restricted land and to mine ores therefrom for the benefit of its Indian wards. Choctaw, O. & G. R. R. v. Harrison, L. Ed. It is elementary that the federal government in all its activities is independent of state control. This rule is broadly applied; and, without congressional consent, no federal agency or instrumentality can be taxed by state authority. 'With regard to taxation, no matter how reasonable, or how universal and undiscriminating, the state's inability to interfere has been regarded as established since McCulloch v. Maryland, L. Ed. 579).' Johnson v. Maryland, And see Farmers' Bank v. Minnesota, L. Ed. Choctaw, O. & G. R. R. v. Harison, supra; Gillespie v. Oklahoma, L. Ed. 
3
4
This court has considered a number of cases quite like the one now before us. In Choctaw, O. & G. R. R. v. Harrison, supra, there was an agreement by the United States that coal lands belonging in common to the members of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Tribes should be mined, and that the royalties should be used for the Indians. The state imposed a tax equal to 2 per centum on the gross receipts from the total production of coal from the mine. It was held that it was an occupation or privilege tax, and that one having a mining lease made in furtherance of the governmental purpose could not be subjected to that burden. In Indian Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, L. Ed. it was held that oil leases of land made by the Osage Tribe were under the protection of the federal government, and that the state could not tax such leases either directly or as represented by the capital stock of the corporation owning them. It was said (page ):
4
5
'A tax upon the leases is a tax upon the power to make them, and could be used to destroy the power to make them. If they cannot be taxes as entities they cannot be taxed vicariously by taxing the stock, whose only value is their value, or by taking the stock as an evidence or measure of their value. * * *'
5
6
In Howard v. Oil Companies, L. Ed. this court affirmed per curiam, the judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma enjoining the enforcement of a tax imposed by the state on the gross value of the production of oil and gas, less the royalty interest, under leases upon Osage lands made for the benefit of the Indians. In Large Oil Co. v. Howard, L. Ed. this court reversed, per curiam, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma ( sustaining a tax on gross value of production of petroleum and gas, less the royalty interest, where the owner of the property sought to be taxed was engaged under the authority of the Secretary of the Interior in the production of oil and gas in what formerly constituted the tribal lands of the Osage Nation. And in Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra, it was held that the net income derived by a lessee from the sale of his share of the oil and gas received under leases of restricted Creek and Osage lands could not be taxed by the state. In each of these cases the tax was condemned as an attempt to tax an instrumentality used by the United States in fulfilling its duties to the Indians.

In this case the lease was made to secure the development of the lands and obtain for the benefit of the restricted Indian owners a percentage of the gross proceeds of the ores to be mined. The ad valorem tax here in controversy was assessed on the ores in mass at the mine before sale, and that was an attempt to tax an agency of the federal government within the principle of the cases cited.

From abundance of caution the company presented a petition for a writ of certiorari; but, as a writ of error lies, the petition will be denied. Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra.

Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the effect of the assailed tax upon the instrumentality of the United States is remote and tax is valid under the doctrine approved in Central Pac. R. R. v. California, L. Ed.

11
Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (dissenting).

12
The property taxed is lead and zinc ore in bins. The land from which the ore was extracted belongs to a Quapaw allottee under the Act of March Restrictions on alienation of the land will not expire until Act of March But the allottee may lease the land for mining and business purposes for ten years unless he is incompetent, in which case the power to lease is vested in the Secretary of the Interior. Act of June The ore in question had been detached from the soil and is personal property. It is owned wholly by the Mining Company, a private Oklahoma corporation organized for profit. The ore is assessed under the general laws of the state which lays an ad valorem property tax on all property, real or personal, not exempt by law from taxation. Payment of the tax will not affect the financial return to the Indian under the lease. No state legislation exempts this property. There is no specific or general provision in any act of Congress which purports to do so. If an exemption exists, it arises directly from the federal Constitution. Does ownership by an incompetent Indian of the land from which the ore was taken or ownership of the ore by an instrumentality of the government create an exemption?
12
13
Is the ore exempt because it has been extracted out of restricted lands? The Quapaw might have conducted the mining operations himself. If he had been competent he might, without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior have leased the land to others for mining purposes for a period of 10 years. If he had operated the mine himself, I see no ground on which it could be held that his ore in the bins would not have been taxable to him, like any other unrestricted property to which he had absolute title.1 The fact that he was incompetent does not render such property exempt from taxation.2 Such incompetency results simply in the imposition of restrictions upon the alienation of his realty, exempting that from taxation. The Kansas Indians, L. Ed. 667. But such restrictions cannot by implication be deemed to extend to personalty, even though the product of the realty, so as to exempt them from taxation. Compare McCurdy v. United States, L. Ed. United States v. Gray (C. C. A.) United States v. Ransom (C. C. A.) Any exemption that attached to the land is limited thereto and does not extend to the ore extracted therefrom. Forbes v. Gracey, Compare South Utah Mines v. Beaver County, L. Ed. 
13
14
Is the ore exempt because it is the property of an agency employed by the government for the benefit of the Indian, its ward? We are not dealing here with property owned by the United States as in Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, L. Ed. or Lee v. Osceola, etc., Improvement District, L. Ed. nor with an agency all of whose property was acquired and is used solely for the purpose of serving the government as in Clallam County v. United States, L. Ed. We are dealing with a private 'corporation having its own purposes as well as those of the United States and interested in profit on its own account.' S. Ct. And we are dealing with a property tax, as distinguished from an occupation tax. Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf Ry. Co. v. Harrison, L. Ed. Oklahoma v. Texas, L. Ed. Whether, under the circumstances, Congress had power to exempt the ore from the general property tax, we need not consider. It has not done so in terms; and I see no reason for assuming that it intended to do so. Compare Mid-Northern Oil Co. v. Walker, L. Ed. Thompson v. Kentucky, L. Ed. Swarts v. Hammer, L. Ed. 
14
15
'It may, therefore, be considered as settled that no constitutional implications prohibit a state tax upon the property of an agent of the government merely because it is the property of such an agent.' Railroad Co. v. Peniston. 
15
16
The rule there applied with respect to a railroad incorporated under a federal charter has since been followed as to other federal instrumentalities also. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Massachusetts, L. Ed. Central Pacific Railroad Co. v. California, L. Ed. Baltimore Shipbuilding Co. v. Baltimore, L. Ed. Gromer v. Standard Dredging Co., L. Ed. Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf Ry. Co. v. Mackey, L. Ed. Compare Thomason v. Pacific Railroad, L. Ed. 792; National Bank v. Commonwealth, It has been specifically applied to agencies, such as this mining company, whose employment was in aid of the government's policy of protecting and developing the properties of its Indian wards. Thomas v. Gay, L. Ed. Wagoner v. Evans, L. Ed. Catholic Missions v. Missoula County, L. Ed. Those decisions seem to me controlling in the case at bar.
16
17
The rule that the property of a privately owned government agency is not exempt from state taxation rests fundamentally upon the principle that such a tax has only a remote relation to the capacity of such agencies efficiently to serve the government.3 Such a tax, as distinguished from an occupation or privilege tax, does not impose a charge upon the privilege of acting as a government agent and thereby enable a state to control the power of the federal government to employ agents and the power of persons to accept such employment. The tax is levied as a charge by the state for rendering services relating to the protection of the property, which services are rendered alike to agents of the government and of private persons. Such a tax cannot be deemed to be capable of deterring the entry of persons as agents into the employ of the government. Conceivably an operating company might pay a higher royalty or bonus if it were assured that it would enjoy immunity from taxation for the small quantity of the year's output of the mine which might be in the ore bins on the day as of which property is assessed. Conceivably also, the cattle owner in Thomas v. Gay, supra, might have paid higher for the grazing rights if the cattle while on the reservation were immune from taxation. But, in either case, the effect of the immunity, if any, upon the Indian's financial return would be remote and indirect. If we are to regard realities we should treat it as negligible.
17
18
The difference in the legal effect of acts which are remote causes and of those which are proximate pervades the law. The power of a state to tax property and its lack of power to tax the occupation in which it is used exist in other connections. In Baltimore Shipbuilding Co. v. Baltimore, where the state had levied a tax upon property conveyed by the United States to the Shipbuilding Company on the condition that it construct a dry dock there for the use of the United States and that, if such dry dock were not kept in repair, the property should revert to the United States, this court said:
18
19
'But, furthermore, it seems to us extravagant to say that an independent private corporation for gain, created by a state, is exempt from state taxation, either in its corporate person, or its property, because it is employed by the United States, even if the work for which it is employed is important and takes much of its time.'
19
20
I suspect that my brethren would agree with me in sustaining this tax on ore in the bins, but for Gillespie v. Oklahoma, L. Ed. The question there involved was different. Any language in the opinion which may seem apposite to the case at bar should be disregarded as inconsistent with the earlier decisions. It is a peculiar virtue of our system of law that the process of inclusion and exclusion, so often employed in developing a rule, is not allowed to end with its enunciation, and that an expression in an opinion yields later to the impact of facts unforeseen. The attitude of the court in this respect has been especially helpful when called upon to adjust the respective powers of the states and the nation in the field of taxation.4

'It is, therefore, manifest that exemption of federal agencies from state taxation is dependent, not upon the nature of the agents, or upon the mode of their constitution, or upon the fact that they are agents, but upon the effect of the tax; that is, upon the question whether the tax does in truth deprive them of power to serve the government as they were intended to serve it, or does hinder the efficient exercise of their power. A tax upon their property has no such necessary effect. It leaves them free to discharge the duties they have undertaken to perform. A tax upon their operations is a direct obstruction to the exercise of federal powers.' Railroad Co. v. Peniston. See T. R.

269 U.S. 364
O'HARA et al.
v.
LUCKENBACH S. S. CO.
Argued Nov. 19, 1925.
1
Petitioners, libelants below, quit the service of the steamship company and sought to recover their earned wages on the ground of a violation of section 2 of the Seamen's Act of March (Comp. St. § ) copied in the margin.1 Omitting the various provisions with which we are not here concered, the pertinent requirement of that section is that:
1
2
'The sailors shall, while at sea, be divided into at least two, and the firemen, oilers, and water tenders into at least three watches, which shall be kept on duty successively for the performance of ordinary work incident to the sailing and management of the vessel.'
2
3
For a failure on the part of the master to comply with this, among other provisions of the section, the seamen are entitled to a discharge and to receive the wages earned. The failure complained of was that the sailors were not divided into watches of equal or approximately equal numbers, as, it was insisted, the statute contemplated.
3
4
The company was the owner the steamship Lewis Luckenbach, a vessel of tons burden, upon which libelants were hired as sailors for a voyage from New York to Pacific ports and return to some port north of Cape Hatteras on the Atlantic. Altogether, there was 13 sailors on board, 3 of whom, including libelants, were assigned as quartermasters. On the voyage and while at sea, these sailors were not equally divided into watches. Three watches were on duty, each consisting of one quartermaster and one able seaman, the remaining seven sailors being kept at day work only. The District Court dismissed the libel and this was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Both courts were of opinion that the primary object of the statutory provision was to fix hours of service so as to prevent overwork, not to prescribe the number of seamen on each watch. The District Court thought that this conception of the law was borne out by the consideration that, if one-half or one-third of the crew must be assigned to duty at night, a majority of them would have little or nothing to do. The Circuit Court of Appeals seemed to think that the purpose of Congress to provide for the safety of the ship was satisfied rather in the selection of qualified quartermasters and men for the lookout than in equality of the watches. With these views we are unable to agree.
4
5
The general purpose of the Seamen's Act is not only to safeguard the welfare of the seamen as workmen, but, as set forth in the title, also 'to promote safety at sea.' The act as a whole shows very clearly that, while hours of work and proper periods of rest were regarded as considerations of primary concern while the vessel is in a safe harbor, these considerations must yield, as they have always yielded, to the paramount necessity of safety while the ship is at sea; and, as indicating that the provision under review was not intended primarily as a regulation of working hours, it is significant that it does not apply to the entire crew, but requires a division into watches only of the sailors and the firemen, oilers, and water tenders. It is natural to suppose that, if the purpose of Congress was chiefly to regulate hours of work, something would have been said about the service, while at sea, of those employed in the steward's department as well. And not only is the division confined to those of the crew engaged in the mechanics of conducting the ship on her voyage, but the imperative requirement is that the watches into which they are divided 'shall be kept on duty successively'; that is to say, by turns, so that one watch must come on as another goes off. The evident purpose was to compel a division of the men for duty on deck and in the fireroom, and continuity of service, to the end that in those departments the ship should at all times be actively manned with equal efficiency.
5
6
It probably is true, as said below, that to construe the statute as compelling numerical equality of the watches will result, so far as the sailors are concerned, in the performance of less work on deck at night. And it may be noted in that connection that, in the hearings before the House committee having charge of the bill, it was objected on behalf of the shipowners, obviously, as the context shows, upon the theory that such equality was in fact contemplated by the provision that, 'on cargo steamers, it would be an injustice to keep a lot of men on watch, all night, and have nothing for them to do.' House Hearings on S. Feb. But the provision, fundamentally, is a measure of precaution against those perilous and often unexpected emergencies of the sea when only immediate and wakeful readiness for action may avert disaster or determine the issue between life and death; its effect as a regulator of working conditions is a matter of subordinate intent. A consideration of other safety provisions of the act will help to make this clear.
6
7
Among them, the act (section (Comp. St. § )) provides that not less than 75 per centum of the crew in each department shall be able to understand any order given by the officers of such vessel, and that a certain percentage of her deck crew shall be of a rating not less than able seaman-meaning, except on the Great Lakes, a seaman, 19 years of age or upwards, who has had at least 3 years' service on deck at sea or on the Great Lakes. It also contains elaborate provisions (section (Comp. St. § ) for the equipment of ocean-going vessels with life-saving appliances, and, among other things, requires (page that:
7
8
'At no moment of its voyage may any ocean cargo steam vessel of the United States have on board a total number of persons greater than that for whom accommodation is provided in the lifeboats on board.'
8
9
None of these provisions is of much, if any, concern, except as a precaution against the unusual crises of the sea.
9
10
As a ship pursues her way in security, perhaps for many years, these requirements for safety appliances and for able seamen may seem overexacting, and the language test, as well as a division of the watches into equal numbers, needlessly burdensome. But it is apparent, from the hearings and debates, that Congress looked forward to the possibility of other disasters like those of the Titanic and the Volturno (the facts of which had been subjected to inquiry by its committees), where, in the one, the lack of lifeboats, probably caused the loss of many lives, although in a quite sea, and where, in the other, lifeboats lowered in a great storm were engulfed, it was thought by some, from the absence of the skill of able seamen in launching them or like that of the City of Rio de Janeiro (In re Pacific Mail S. S. Co., L. R. A. 71), which sank with many of its lifeboats unlaunched because the crew of Chinese sailors were unable to understand the language in which the orders of their officers were given. The following from the opinion in that case (page ) is peculiarly apposite:
10
11
'It is, as was said by Judge Hawley in Re Meyer (D. C.) 'the duty of the owners of a steamer carrying goods and passengers, not only to provide a seaworthy vessel, but they must also provide the vessel with a crew adequate in number, and competent for their duty with reference to all the exigencies of the intended route'; not merely competent for the ordinary duties of an uneventful voyage, but for any exigency that is likely to happen. * * * The case shows that the City of Rio de Janeiro left the port of Honolulu, on the voyage under consideration, with a crew of 84 Chinamen, officered by white men. The officers could not speak the language of the Chinese, and but two of the latter-the boatswain and chief fireman-could understand that of the officers. Consequently, the orders of the officers had to be communicated either through the boatswain or chief fireman, or by signs and signals. So far as appears, that seems to have worked well enough on the voyage in question, until the ship came to grief, and there arose the necessity for quick and energetic action in the darkness. In that emergency the crew was wholly inefficient and incompetent, as the sad results proved. The boats were in separate places on the ship. The sailors could not understand the language in which the orders of the officers in command of the respective boats had to be given. It was too dark for them to see signs (if signs could have been intelligibly given), and only one of the two Chinese who spoke English appears to have known anything about the lowering of a boat, and there had been no drill of the crew in the matter of lowering them. Under such circumstances it is not surprising that but three of the boats were lowered, one of which was successfully launched by the efforts of Officer Coghlan and the ship's carpenter, another of which was swamped by one of the Chinese crew letting the after fall down with a run, and the third of which was lowered so slowly that it was swamped as the ship went down. We have no hesitation in holding that the ship was insufficiently manned, for the reason that the sailors were unable to understand and execute the orders made imperative by the exigency that unhappily arose, and resulted so disastrously to life, as well as to property.'
11
12
See, also, R. S. § amended by Act May (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. ; Flint & P. M. R. Co. v. Marine Ins. Co. (C. C.) Northern Commercial Co v. Lindblom. 
12
13
It is not unreasonable to conclude that Congress gress determined that each of the watches. like the crew as a whole, should be 'adequate in number,' competent and in a state of readiness 'for any exigency that is likely to happen'-such as a collision, the striking of the ship upon a reef of rocks or an iceberg, the sudden breaking out of fire, and other happenings of like disastrous tendency-and to this end meant to provide for successive and continuous watches to be constituted in numbers as nearly equal as the sum of the whole number would permit.
13
14
In this conclusion we are fortified by the consideration that the legislation deals with seamen and the merchant marine and, consequently, the phrase 'divided into * * * watches' is to be given the meaning which it had acquired in the language and usages of the trade to which the act relates, in accordance with the rule stated in Unwin v. Hanson, (;
14
15
'If the act is one passed with reference to a particular trade, business, or transaction, and words are used which everybody conversant with that trade, business, or transaction, knows and understands to have a particular meaning in it, then the words are to be construed as having that particular meaning, though it may differ from the common or ordinary meaning of the words.'
15
16
In the understanding of the sailor, a division into 'watches,' as applied to the personnel of the ship, connotes a division as nearly equal as possible.
16
17
'At sea a ship's crew is commonly divided into two watches: The master, second mate, fourth mate (if any), with one-half of the seamen and boys, forming the so-called 'starboard watch'; after four hours these are relived by the chief mate, and the third officer (if any), and the other half of the men, who from the 'port watch." Paasch, Marine Encyclopedia. 
17
18
R. H. Dana, Jr., in his 'Dictionary of Sea Terms,' p. defines the term 'watch' as:
18
19
'Also, a certain portion of a ship's company, appointed to stand a given length of time. In the merchant service all hands are divided into two watches, larboard and starboard, with a mate to command each.'
19
20
'The men are divided as equally as possible, with reference to their qualities as able seamen, ordinary seamen, or boys (as all green hands are called, whatever their age may be); but, if the number is unequal, the larboard watch had the odd one, since the chief mate does not go aloft and do other duty in his watch, as the second mate does in his.'
20
21
The point is emphasized by the use of the distinctive terms 'anchor watch' and 'sea watch'; the former meaning the lookout intrusted to one or two men when the vessel is at anchor, and the latter being used 'when one-half of a ship's crew is on duty' at sea. Paasch. 
21
22
It is true that this meaning had its origin in the customs of the sea before the advent of steam, but there is nothing to show that it has now a different meaning; and, with nothing in the context and no evidential circumstances to suggest the contrary, we fairly may assume that the use of the technical terms of the trade to which the statute relates imports their technical meaning.
22
23
Decree reversed.

Sec. 2. That in all merchant vessels of the United States of more than one hundred tons gross, excepting those navigating rivers, harbors, bays, or sounds exclusively, the sailors shall, while at sea be devided into at least two, and the firemen, oilers, and water tenders into at least three watches, which shall be kept on duty successively for the performance of ordinary work incident to the sailing and management of the vessel. The seamen shall not be shipped to work alternately in the fireroom and on deck, nor shall those shipped for deck duty be required to work in the fireroom, or vice versa; but these provisions shall not limit either the authority of the master or other officer or the obedience of the seamen when, in the judgment of the master or other officer, the whole or any part of the crew are needed for the maneuvering of the vessel or the performance of work necessary for the safety of the vessel or her cargo, or for the saving of life aboard other vessels in jeopardy, or when in port or at sea from requiring the whole or any part of the crew to participate in the performance of fire, lifeboat, and other drills. While such vessel is in a safe harbor no seaman shall be required to do any unnecessary work on Sundays or the following named days: New Year's Day, the Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day, but this shall not prevent the dispatch of a vessel on regular schedule or when ready to proceed on her voyage. And at all times while such vessel is in a safe harbor, nine hours, inclusive of the anchor watch, shall constitute a day's work. Whenever the master of any vessel shall fail to comply with this section, the seamen shall be entitled to discharge from such vessel and to receive the wages earned. But this section shall not apply to fishing or whaling vessels or yachts.

269 U.S. 411
UNITED STATES
v.
RIVER ROUGE IMPROVEMENT CO. et al.
Argued March 10 and 11, 1924.
1
Pursuant to an appropriation for the improvement of the Rouge River, Michigan, made in the Rivers and Harbors Act of August 8, 1917,1 the United States filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan five petitions for the condemnation of numerous parcels of riparian land needed for such improvement, and, also, of a gas main passing underneath the river.2
1
2
The petitions were consolidated, and a jury trial had resulting in seventy-three awards of compensation to the property owners. Judgments were entered confirming all these awards. Writs of error were sued out by the United States to review the judgments as to fifteen of the awards to riparian land owners and the award to the owner of the gas main. These were heard by the Circuit Court of Appeals as one case, and all the judgments were affirmed except that awarding compensation to the owner of the gas main, as to which a new trial was granted. This writ of error is brought to review the judgments as to the awards thus affirmed, involving fifteen parcels of land.
2
3
1. We are of opinion that, although a new trial was granted as to the award to the owner of the gas main, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals as to the awards to the riparian land owners, has such finality and completeness that it may be reviewed under this writ of error. The controversy as to the gas main is entirely distinct from those as to the riparian lands; and its result can have no bearing whatever upon the awards to the land owners. While the general rule requires that a judgment of a federal court shall be final and complete before it may be reviewed on a writ of error or appeal, it is well settled that an adjudication final in its nature as to a matter distinct from the general subject of the litigation and affecting only the parties to the particular controversy, may be reviewed without awaiting the determination of the general litigation. Williams v. Morgan, L. Ed. Collins v. Miller, L. Ed. Arnold v. Guimarin, L. Ed. And so, conversely, an adjudication final in its nature as to the general subject of the litigation may be reviewed without awaiting the determination of a separate matter affecting only the parties to such particular controversy.
3
4
2. The principal matter here involved relates to the benefits to the land owners which were to be considered in reduction of their compensation and damages. The Rivers and Harbors Act of July 18, 1918,3 contains a provision-whose validity is not questioned-that in all condemnation proceedings by the United States to acquire lands for the public use in connection with any improvement of rivers, where a part only of any parcel of land is taken, the jury 'shall take into consideration by way of reducing the amount of compensation or damages any special and direct benefits to the remainder arising from the improvement.' In each of the sixteen instances here involved the United States condemned only a portion of the parcel of land belonging to the riparian owner. It insists that there was error in the instructions to the jury in reference to the extent and measure of the benefits to the remainder.
4
5
The Rouge River, which empties into the Detroit River, had long been used for purposes of navigation, and various industrial plants were located along its banks. Although it had been somewhat improved by the United States prior to the channel was narrow, winding, comparatively shallow, and incapable of accommodating large freighters. Under the terms of the Act of the new improvement was to be made in accordance with a plan recommended by the engineers of the War Department.4 This contemplated straightening the channel of the river and widening and deepening it for about four miles above its mouth, so that it would accommodate the largest type of freighters on the Great Lakes and become, as was said, 'practically a long slip serving for numerous docks and industries.' The bottom width of the new channel was to be feet, the banks sloping to a top width of feet between the harbor lines. After its completion riparian owners desiring to construct docks were to be 'required to locate the dock line or retaining wall' upon the harbor line, and excavate the bank 'in front of the retaining wall or dock front' to the depty necessary to permit vessels to lie alongside.
5
6
The portions of the lands which were condemned were those lying within the limits of the widened channel or harbor lines. The United States contended that the remaining portions of these parcels would receive special and direct benefits from the improvement by reason of fronting on the widened river and having direct access thereto for the building of docks and other purposes of navigation for which they had not been previously available.
6
7
We are of opinion that an increase in the value of the remaining portion of any parcel of land caused by its frontage on the widened river, carrying a right of immediate access to and use of the improved stream, would constitute a special and direct benefit within the meaning of the statute, as distinguished from a benefit common to all the lands in the vicinity, although the remaining portions of other riparian parcels would be similarly benefited. This is in accordance with the rule recognized by this court and established by the weight of authority in the state courts in reference to special benefits to lands abutting upon a new or widened street. Bauman v. Ross, L. Ed. Allen v. Charlestown, Hilbourne v. Suffolk County, Am. Rep. Cross v. Plymouth, Abbott v. Cottage City, Am. Rep. Lewis v. Seattle, Lowe v. Omaha, St. Louis Railway v. Fowler, Lewis' Eminent Domain ( And see Roberts v. Commissioners, Trosper v. Commissioners, In Allen v. Charlestown, supra, the rule is thus stated:
7
8
'The benefit is not less direct and special to the land of the petitioner, because other estates upon the same street are benefited in a similar manner. The kind of benefit, which is not allowed to be estimated for the purpose of such deduction, is that which comes from sharing in the common advantage and convenience of increased public facilities, and the general advance in value of real estate in the vicinity by reason thereof. * * * The advantages of more convenient access to the particular lot of land in question, and of having a front upon a more desirable avenue, are direct benefits to that lot, giving it increased value in itself. It may be the same, in greater or less degree, with each and every lot of land upon the same street. But such advantages are direct and special to each lot. They are in no proper sense common because there are several estates, or many even, that are similarly benefited.'
8
9
But while the trial judge recognized the right of the United States to the deduction of such special benefits, if any, it insists that in charging the jury in reference to them he erroneously minimized their nature and extent. In this portion of the charge the court stated, inter alia, that the Government had 'the absolute power of control' over navigable streams, and the right to deprive any riparian owner of all access to the navigable portion of the stream and order the removal of any docks or other structures placed in the stream; that the deepening and widening of the channel would not confer on any riparian owner any property right to use the river for loading or unloading of vessels, this being 'subject to the absolute power of control by the Government'; that the jury could not make any deduction of benefits on the theory that the improvement would increase any property right in connection with the access to or use of the river or bring the owner any new or different property right of access and use of purposes of navigation; that no benefit could be deducted unless the remainder of the land was rendered suitable for new or greater uses in navigation because of its new location 'and because of a greater opportunity directly and specially to enjoy such use of the improved river as the Government may permit such owner to have;' and that the jury should keep 'always in mind the uncertainty of securing from the Government the privilege to enjoy these advantages, and the limited character of whatever advantages may be so secured.'

The United States not only excepted to these portions of the charge, but also requested that the jury be instructed, as bearing upon the existence and amount of the special benefits, that a riparian owner bordering on the new stream would have in respect thereto the usual rights of navigation pertinent to riparian property, that is, the right of access to the navigable part of the river in front of his property and the right to make a landing, dock or pier upon his harbor line, subject only to such general rules and regulations as the Government, in its power over navigation, might properly impose for the protection of the public right of navigation; that this power of the Government 'over navigation for the protection of public rights can not be arbitrarily and capriciously exercised so as to destroy these riparian rights, but must be exercised with reasonable relations to the requirements of navigation'; and that, by the terms of the plan of improvement, riparian owners whose lands would border the new stream, were given the right or privilege of constructing docks or retaining walls for their use upon the harbor line, and to excavate the bank in front thereof to the depth necessary to permit vessels to lie alongside. These requests were denied; and the United States excepted.

11
We are of opinion that the giving of these instructions and the refusal of these requests involved prejudicial error. It is well settled that in the absence of a controlling local law otherwise limiting the rights of a riparian owner upon a navigable river, Shively v. Bowlby, L. Ed. he has, in addition to the rights common to the public a property right, incident to his ownership of the bank, of access from the front of his land to the navigable part of the stream, and when not forbidden by public law may construct landings, wharves or piers for this purpose. Dutton v. Strong, L. Ed. 29; Railroad Co. v. Schurmeier, Yates v. Milwaukee, L. Ed. 984; Transportation Co. v. Parkersburg, L. Ed. St. Louis v. Rutz, L. Ed. Illinois Central Railroad v. Illinois, L. Ed. Weems Steamboat Co. v. Peoples' Co., L. Ed. United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., L. Ed. There is no limitation upon this right of a riparian owner in the laws of Michigan. On the contrary it was recognized in Lorman v. Benson, Am. Dec. 435, that the rights of riparian owners must be determined by the common law so far as applicable to the local situation; and in Ryan v. Brown, Am. Dec. it was said that:
11
12
'If wharves and similar conveniences were not allowed upon our large streams, the shipping business would become practically worthless. It can never be unlawful for a land owner to make such wharves and landlings as will accommodate all vessels ordinarily using the stream, unless there are some exceptional circumstances, as narrows, bends, or the like, which may in particular cases render his structures improper.'
12
13
This right of a riparian owner, it is true, is subordinate to the public right of navigation, and subject to the general rules and regulations imposed for the protection of such public right. And it is of no avail against the exercise of the absolute power of Congress over the improvement of navigable rivers, but must suffer the consequences of the improvement of navigation, if Congress determines that its continuance is detrimental to the public interest in the navigation of the river. United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., supra. 
13
14
The right of the United States in the navigable waters within the several States is, however, 'limited to the control thereof for purposes of navigation.' Port of Seattle v. Oregon Railroad. And while Congress, in the exercise of this power, may adopt, in its judgment, any means having some positive relation to the control of navigation and not otherwise inconsistent with the Constitution, United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., supra, it may not arbitrarily destroy or impair the rights of riparian owners by legislation which has no real or substantial relation to the control of navigation or appropriateness to that end. In Yates v. Milwaukee, supra, it was said in reference to the right of a riparian owner of a navigable stream:
14
15
'This riparian right is property, and is valuable, and, though it must be enjoyed in due subjection to the rights of the public, it cannot be arbitrarily or capriciously destroyed or impaired.'
15
16
This language was cited with approval in Illinois Central Railroad v. Illinois, supra.

17
Considering the charge of the court in the light of these general principles, we find that it was permeated by the fundamental error, emphasized by the refusal of the requests, that the jury were left to determine the amount of the benefits to be deducted on the theory that a riparian owner on the improved river would have merely such uncertain and contingent 'privileges' of access to the navigable stream and of constructing docks fronting on the harbor line, as the Government, in the exercise of an absolute control over the navigation of the river, might see fit to allow him, instead of being instructed that he would have a right to such access and the construction and maintenance of such docks until taken away by the Government in the due exercise of its power of control over navigation. And this error was the more serious since the plan of the improvement contemplated that the improved river should become a slip for a docks and industries and recognized the right of a riparian owner to construct docks upon the harbor line; and there was nothing in the evidence indicating any probability that the Government would at any time abrogate or curtail this right in any respect.
17
18
The Circuit Court of Appeals, while stating that the trial court had over-emphasized the elements of uncertainty in the rights of riparian owners and the contingent character of these rights, was of opinion that, under all the circumstances, such over-emphasis was not sufficiently prejudicial to call for a reversal of the judgment. With this we cannot agree. The charge was not merely an over-emphasis of the contingent character of the rights of the riparian owners, but in substance an instruction that they had no rights in this respect, and could only obtain uncertain privileges, as a matter of grace. There is an essential difference between a substantial property right which may be enjoyed until taken away in the appropriate exercise of a paramount authority, and an uncertain and contingent privilege which may not be allowed at all. The failure to observe this distinction went to the root of the charge in reference to the deduction of benefits. And its natural, if not inevitable, effect, was to lead the jury to a lower estimate of the benefits than would have been made under a proper charge.

19
The present case is not controlled by the provision of section of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of February 26, 1919,5 that in an appellate proceeding judgment shall be given after an examination of the entire record, 'without regard to technical errors, defects, or exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.' We need not enter upon a discussion of the divergent views which have been expressed in various Circuit Courts of Appeals as to the effect of the Act of It suffices to say that since the passage of this Act, as well as before, an error which relates, not to merely formal or technical matters, but to the substantial rights of the parties-especially when embodied in the charge to a jury-is to he held a ground for reversal, unless it appears from the whole record that it was harmless and did not prejudice the rights of the complaining party. See Yazoo Railroad v. Mullins, L. Ed. Fillippon v. Albion Slate Co., L. Ed. In the present case the error in the charge could not but mislead the jury in reference to a material element necessary for its consideration in determining the amounts of the awards; and it cannot be said from the whole record that the substantial rights of the United States were not prejudiced thereby. The judgments of the District Court should therefore have been reversed, and new trials granted.
19
 It is unnecessary to set forth various errors assigned as to other rulings of the trial court. These matters were fully and carefully considered by the Circuit Court of Appeals, and we are entirely satisfied with the conclusions which it reached in reference to them.
20
21
The judgments of the District Court and Circuit Court of Appeals are reversed, and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.

Judgments reversed.
