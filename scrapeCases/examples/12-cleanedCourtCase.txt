THE SEA GULL.
October Term, 1874
1
CROSS-APPEAL from the decree of the Circuit Court for the District of Maryland, dividing equally the damages arising from a collision at sea, between the schooner Sarah and the steamer Sea Gull, on the theory that each was equally in fault.
1
2
A statute of the United States—the act of 29th April, 1864 thus enacts:
2
3
'ARTICLE 16. Every steamship, in approaching another ship, so as to involve risk of collision, shall slacken her speed, or, if necessary, stop and reverse.1
3
4
'ARTICLE 15. If two ships, one of which is a sailing-ship and the other a steamship, are proceeding in such directions as to involve risk of collision, the steamship shall keep out of the way of the sailing-ship.'
4
5
These provisions did but embody in a statutory form, what was previously the well-settled law of the sea.2
5
6
On the evening of January the steamer Sea Gull was sailing in the open sea from the north, between Baltimore and Charleston, for the south, in a course south by west half-west, and the schooner Sarah between the same ports, from the south for the north in a course northeast by east. The vessels were thus approaching on converging lines. The steamer's speed was about eight miles an hour, the schooner's seven, and the nearest land was thirty miles distant. There was a fresh breeze, west-southwest. Stars were visible overhead, and though it was somewhat hazy on the water the night was fairly to be called a clear one.
6
7
Both vessels had proper lights brightly burning in their proper places. The schooner had one lookout properly placed, and the steamer had one lookout also; the steamer's lookout being on the forecastle, and, as was testified, within a few feet of the steam. At about nine o'clock in the evening the lookout on the schooner described and reported a light ahead. The light proved to be the foremast-headlight of a steamer, about four miles distant, and one point on the port bow of the schooner. The red or portlight of the steamer, which was still on the schooner's port bow, soon now became visible. The schooner, according to the positive testimony of three witnesses on her, including the pilot and the captain, who was at his side giving orders—the captain giving repeated orders to this effect, and calling the helmsman's attention to a star by which he could steer if he could not by the compass—continued her course, when, according to the testimony of these same witnesses, the steamer not having previously changed her course at all, and the vessels being close by one another, the green or starboard light of the steamer came suddenly into view; showing, of course, that the helm of the steamer had been starboarded. The captain and master testified that not knowing on which side of her the steamer would attempt to pass, and deeming it prudent and their duty under the circumstances still to keep their course, so as not to baffle those in charge of the steamer in any effort which they might make, even at the last moment, to pass on either side, still kept the schooner steadily on her course, but that the steamer continued, with undiminished speed, to approach. The result was a collision in which the steamer ran so violently into the schooner as to cut three or four feet into her, and sink her almost immediately; those on board barely escaping with their lives.
7
8
The only oral or written evidence from witnesses on the schooner tending to show any other proceedings than these, was that of the captain himself, who testified that when the steamer was about to strike the schooner, and only forty or fifty yards off, he shouted out, 'Let go her gaff-topsail, and lower her peak;' but that the order was not executed, the collision having occurred immediately after it was given, and before time had elapsed to execute it.
8
9
However, three witnesses from the steamer—the captain, the second mate, and the helmsman—all swore the when the collision took place, the course of the schooner was southeast; a course which would have been produced by the execution of the captain's order to change the schooner's sails, and that as they saw her sails after the schooner was struck her sails were on the port side.
9
10
As respected what was done on board the steamer, it seemed from the testimony of witnesses from her that the schooner was not seen until about a quarter of an hour after the schooner had seen the steamer; that her sails were then seen by the lookout, though they could not be well distinguished from each other; that the captain, whose watch it was, was in his room, asleep; that the second mate belonged to the captain's watch, and was accustomed to be on deck only during the captain's command, when his own position was subordinate; and that on this occasion he had taken charge of the captain's watch; that the second mate saw the vessel on the starboard bow, about the same time the lookout did, and at once gave the order 'hard a starboard,' to the man at the wheel, helping him to heave it hard a starboard himself; that when the order to heave hard a starboard was given, no lights, either red or green, were seen, and that the schooner was then supposed to be half a mile off, if not more; that the steamer answering the wheel, her head fell off to port, three or four points, and the second mate then saw the schooner's red light plainly, and saw that she had ported her helm and changed her course, about half a point to the east, which brought her across the steamer's bow; that the moment this was seen, the wheel was put hard a port; that on the same moment the bell was rung, the engine was stopped, and the captain was in the act of ringing the bell to back the ship when the collision took place; a collision so seriously injuring the steamer that water came into her by the barrelful, and that it was only by incessant working of the steam pumps that the vessel was able to make port (which she sought at once to do), at all. How exactly the schooner was struck, and where, was a matter about which the testimony was not harmonious.
10
11
One witness (the second mate of the steamer) testified that the steamer struck the schooner on her port side, just forward of the main-chain, nearly at right angles, with a slight slant towards the bow of the schooner.
11
12
Other witnesses testified that the steamer struck with a slight slant towards the stern of the schooner.
12
13
It was more plainly proved that the steamer received her injury on the port side of her stem.
13
14
The District Court held both vessels liable.
14
15
In regard to the steamer, the court said that before the officer in command changed its course, he should have waited to see the lights of the schooner, and as the vessels were approaching at the rate of fifteen miles an hour, have stopped the steamer's engine; that starboarding was a false movement; one not corrected but made worse by the subsequent porting.
15
16
In regard to the schooner, while the court confessed to a good deal of difficulty, in view of the conflict of evidence, and in a certain want of particularity in it, as to exact times when things were stated to have been seen, in saying that the schooner too was to blame, yet relying upon the evidence of the three persons on the steamer, that when the collision took place the course of the schooner was southeast and her sails on the port side, and on the further testimony of the second mate of the steamer, that she struck the schooner on her port side just forward of the main chain nearly at right angles, with a slight slant towards the bow of the vessel, the court thought that the course of the schooner must have been changed before the collision. The court, therefore, held both vessels equally in fault, and made each equally responsible for the damages; expressing a hope, however, that the case might be reviewed by another tribunal.
16
17
The Circuit Court, on appeal, affirmed the decree of the District Court, and from the decree of affirmance the case was now here on appeals by both vessels.
17
18
Messrs. S. T. Wallis and J. H. Thomas, for the owners of the schooner:
18
 The steamer was exclusively in fault. She had but one lookout. She was an ocean steamer and, as such, should have had two; and they ought to have been on the very bow of the boat, on the lower deck, looking ahead.3
19
20
It was the captain's watch. He should have been on deck.4 He was asleep in his cabin. The second mate was on his watch, and took charge of it. The result shows that the mate was incompetent for the duty which, owing to the captain's neglect, was put upon him.
20
21
With inattentive and incompetent officers thus proved to have been in charge of the steamer, every presumption, in matters where the testimony conflicts or is obscure, is against her; and with this as a thing not to be denied the whole case is to be considered.
21
22
The steamer took no measures to discover the course of the schooner when she was seen, but immediately starboarded and a moment after ported her wheel. She did not stop her engines till the moment of collision.
22
 The schooner was not in fault. Both of her lights were burning brightly. She saw the steamer's headlight five miles off. Gave immediate orders to the helmsman, and several times repeated them, to keep her steadily on her course. She did not change her course from the moment she saw the steamer up to the moment of collision. If the testimony leaves any room for doubt on this point, it shows, at all events, that she did not change until they were within thirty or forty feet of each other. A change at such a moment could not have contributed to the collision. If it did, she will not be held responsible for a mistake in a moment of well-founded alarm and danger, needlessly produced by the previous fault of the steamer.
23
24
The steamer alleges that the schooner changed her course. This court has heretofore said:
24
25
'This is the stereotyped excuse usually resorted to for the purpose of justifying a careless collision. It is always improbable, and generally false.'5
25
26
An attempt was made to create the impression that some of the witnesses for the steamer saw the sails of the schooner on her port side before the collision. But in the face of the evidence, that the schooner was kept on her course, the strong probability is that none of them saw the direction of her sails until after the collision.
26
27
Even if her foresail, the one nearest the steamer and that most likely to be seen by her, was momentarily on the port side, it might be true consistently with the theory and testimony of the schooner. Going as they were, before the wind, the foresail would be occasionally becalmed by the mainsail. It was then liable to flap over to the port side.
27
28
The witnesses on the schooner swear positively that her course was not changed. They speak from knowledge. Any counter evidence from persons on the steamer is from inference only.6
28
29
The District Court would have adopted this reasoning, and have concluded that the schooner did not change her course, but for what it considered a controlling fact leading to a contrary conclusion. He considered, of course, that if the schooner had not changed her course she would have been struck a slanting blow on the port side, with a slight slant towards the stern. There are witnesses who prove that such was the exact blow given, and confessedly the steamer's bow was injured on its port side, not on its starboard; a fact which tends to show that the sort of blow which the District Court supposes was not given, was the very one that was.
29
30
The vast advantages which vessels navigated by steam have over sailing-vessels, is their capacity to turn suddenly, and most of all to stop at once; and this, with all their tremendous power, and the effect of a collision with them, has led courts to hold, almost as an irrebuttable presumption, that when, on a clear night, in open sea, a collision takes place between a steamer and a sailing-vessel the fault must be with the steamer; or at least to require very plain proof that it was not.
30
31
The courts do but give effect to that provision, alike of a positive statute and of the common law of the sea, that 'if two ships, one of which is a sailing-ship, are proceeding in such directions as to involve risk of collision, the steamship shall keep out of the way of the sailing-ship.'
31
32
In two cases where the sailing-vessels were held in any part responsible, the night was not clear and the schooners either had no light or insufficient ones.7
32
33
Messrs. J. H. B. Latrobe and I. N. Steele, contra, for the steamer:
33
34
That the steamer changed its course after sighting the schooner is admitted. The steamer's course down the coast having been southwest-half-west, adding three and a half points to port, and then deducting half a point to starboard, her course at the time of the collision would be south and by west half west.
34
35
And this we assume as the fact.
35
36
But did not the schooner change her course also? And here the usual contradictory testimony begins.
36
37
The schooner's witnesses, one and all, swear that up to the moment of collision the schooner's course was not changed; and, if they are to be believed, the schooner's course at the moment of collision was northeast by east.
37
38
The same witnesses swear, however, that the steamer struck the schooner at right angles and penetrated some three or four feet.
38
39
Now, they cannot be right on both points. Had the schooner held her course, northeast by east, that of the steamer being southwest by west-half-west, the steamer would have struck her at an angle of thirty-nine degrees, about; when a penetration of the schooner, such as all the witnesses on both sides agree took place, was physically impossible.
39
40
It follows as a matter of course then, as decided by the District and Circuit Courts, that the schooner changed its course.
40
41
This puts the case on two indisputable facts; first, the position of the steamer at the time of the collision; and second, the square blow received by the schooner.
41
42
Nor is this all. That the captain of the schooner intended to change his course is proved by the command he gave to lessen his aftersail preparatory to jibing, 'Let go the gafftopsail-sheet; slack the peak down.'
42
43
Now, as these orders would not have been given had it not been intended to go to the eastward, and as the course of the vessel was to the southeast when struck, the inference is strong that the order must have been given in time for the change in position testified to by witnesses on the steamer.
43
44
It was partially on reasoning like the foregoing that the courts below came to the conclusion that the schooner changed her course. And inasmuch as this change of course seems to have proceeded from no apprehension on the part of the captain of the schooner—for he speaks of none—there was nothing to justify it. Had he kept his course there would have been no collision; or, at most, the comparatively harmless one attending a glancing blow at an angle of half a point.
44
45
Had there been no other testimony in the case but that which is here referred to, the decree would have been for the owners of the steamer.
45
46
There was other testimony, however; and this, in the court's opinion, involving the steamer, the loss was divided.
46
47
We contend, however, that the steamer was altogether blameless in the premises.
47
48
The gravamen of the charge against her is that the helm was put to starboard, and not the port, as it is contended it should have been when the schooner was seen approaching, and that subsequently it was ported.
48
49
But starboarding the helm when the schooner was seen over the steamer's starboard bow, was running away from the approaching vessel and consequently proper. To port the helm subsequently was equally proper, when it became apparent from seeing the red light that the approaching vessel had changed her course.
49
50
Much reliance is had by the other side on the fact that the captain was in the cabin when the collision became inevitable. If by any possibility the accident could have been attributable to his absence, no doubt the consequences should be visited upon the steamer. But if we show, as we do, that everything was done that was proper to be done in the case, irrespective of the captain, his absence becomes a matter of indifference.8
50
51
Mr. Justice CLIFFORD delivered the opinion of the court.
51
52
Until within a recent period the sailing regulations founded in ancient usage, sometimes called sea laws, sanctioned by the decisions of the admiralty courts, furnished the principal rules of navigation in such emergencies, aided by the adjudications of the prize courts, whose practice conforms in some respects to the law of nations. Recently Congress has enacted regulations upon the subject, and those regulations are obligatory upon our commercial marine in all cases where they apply, but inasmuch as the act of Congress does not profess to regulate the whole subject of sailing-rules it cannot be understood as superseding the prior established usages of navigation which are not embraced in the sailing-rules contained in the Congressional enactment.
52
53
Signal lights of a prescribed character are required to be carried by steam-vessels when under way, and sailing-ships under way are required to carry similar lights, with the exception of the white masthead lights, which they shall never carry. Such a requirement, however, is of very little or no value unless the lights are properly displayed and kept burning brightly, nor is it then of any value as a precaution unless those in charge of the other vessel use the means to see the approaching lights before it is too late to adopt the proper measures to prevent a collision.
53
54
Lookouts are also required by the usages of navigation, but the object of the requirement will never be accomplished in case the lookout fails to perform the duty which the requirement contemplates. Nautical lookouts must be properly stationed, and should be vigilant in the performance of their duty, and if they are incompetent or inattentive, and the collision occurs in consequence of their neglect, the vessel to which the lookout is attached must be held responsible for the injury resulting to the other vessel.
54
55
Steamers approaching a sail-ship in such a direction as to involve risk of collision are required to keep out of the way of the sail-ship, but the sail-ship is required to keep her course unless the circumstances are such as to render a departure from the rule necessary in order to avoid immediate danger.
55
56
Vessels with sails being required to keep their course the duty of adopting the necessary measures of precaution to keep out of the way is devolved upon the steamer, subject only to the condition that the sail-ship shall keep her course and do no act to embarrass the steamer in her efforts to perform her duty. Doubtless the steamer may go to the right or left if she can keep out of the way, but if not, and the approach is such as to involve risk of collision, she is required to slacken her speed, or if necessary stop and reverse, and if she fails to perform her duty as required by the rules of navigation she is responsible for the consequences if the sail-ship is without fault, unless the steamer can show that the collision was the result of causes which could not be foreseen or prevented, or of inevitable accident.
56
57
In the case before us both vessels had proper signal lights and both had lookouts, but the better opinion is that the lookout of the steamer was not as vigilant as he should have been in the performance of his duty. Strong support to that view is derived from the fact that the lights of the steamer were seen by the lookout of the schooner when the vessels were three or four miles apart, but those in charge of the steamer saw nothing of the schooner until the two vessels were within a half-mile of each other, and then saw at first only the sails of the schooner and those indistinctly.
57
58
Where the emergency is great the order to the helmsman should undoubtedly be prompt, but under the circumstances of this case it was a rash act of the second mate to direct the man at the wheel to starboard the helm, as he did, before he had employed any available means to ascertain the course of the schooner. He admits that he had not seen the lights of the approaching vessel and the lookout admits the same thing. They both say that they saw the sails, but they admit that they could not distinguish one sail from another, and it may be that it was the shadow of the sails and not the sails themselves which was present to their sight at that moment.
58
59
Evidently the order was an injudicious one, which is sufficiently shown by the testimony of the officer who gave it, as he admits that in a short time he found it to be advisable to countermand the order and to direct the wheelsman to put the helm hard to port. Well-founded doubt cannot be entertained that if that order had been given in the first place the collision would never have taken place. Probably it was too late then, as the steamer had fallen off three or four points before the second order could be fully executed, and it appears that the collision occurred before the steame could be brought back under the second order to the course she was pursuing antecedent to the first change made in her course.
59
60
These repugnant orders manifestly put the steamer upon a zigzag course, that is, first to the left and then to the right, and afford plenary proof that the officer in charge of the deck was in great doubt what to do, in which event it was his plain duty to slacken his speed, or, if necessary, as it plainly was, to stop and reverse, but he did nothing of the kind in season to render any such precaution effectual.
60
61
Undoubtedly it was the privilege of the steamer to go to the right or left if in so doing she could, with reasonable certainty, keep out of the way; but if not, it became her imperative duty to slacken her speed and, if necessary, to stop and reverse.
61
62
Corresponding conclusions were reached by the district judge, except that he did not find that the lookout of the steamer failed to see the lights of the approaching schooner as soon as he might have done if he had performed his duty. Much reason exists to conclude that the first error of the officer in charge of the deck was occasioned by that omission of the lookout, and that the excitement induced when he discovered that his first order was an improper one had more or less influence in promoting the subsequent errors. Subject to that qualification the views expressed by the district judge in respect to the conduct of the officer in charge of the deck of the steamer appear to be correct.
62
63
Cases arise unquestionably in which the want of a lookout, or his failure to perform his duty, will not be imputed to a vessel as a culpable fault, as where it appears that the other vessel was seen by the officer in charge of the deck in season to adopt every needful precaution, and that the want of a lookout or his failure to perform his duty as such did not and could not have contributed to the disaster, but it is very doubtful, in view of the circumstances, whether the case before the court falls within the first condition, and it is quite clear that the evidence will not support the conclusion that the negligence of the lookout did not materially contribute to the subsequent mistakes and vacillating conduct of the officer in charge of the deck of the steamer.9
63
64
Approaching, as the two vessels were, on converging lines, it would clearly seem that the lookout of the steamer ought to have seen the schooner much earlier, as the evidence is full to the point that her signal lights were burning brightly, and if he had, it is not doubted that the collision would have been avoided, as the officer in charge of the deck of the steamer would, in all probability, have acted with more deliberation, in which event it may well be supposed he would not have given the direction that the course of the steamer should be changed before he had ascertained the course of the approaching vessel.
64
65
Considering the proximity of the vessels it may be admitted that prompt action was required, but it is plain that it was bad seamanship to change the course of the steamer before it had been ascertained whether the effect of the change directed would be to diminish or increase the danger to be apprehended from the impending peril. They, the two vessels, were still a half a mile apart, and time enough remained to adopt the proper precautions to prevent a collision, nor is it any valid excuse for the error committed to say that the officer in command of the deck was ignorant of the course of the schooner when he gave the order to starboard the helm, as in that event he should have waited a moment for that information, or, if the peril was impending and the danger too immediate to justify any delay on the occasion, then he should have slackened his speed, or, if necessary, stopped and reversed, as required by the sixteenth sailing-rule.
65
66
Beyond all doubt the order to starboard, under the circumstances, was an error, and the evidence warrants the inference that the officer who gave it came to the same conclusion as soon as he saw the red light of the schooner, which he admits he did see in a very short time after he gave the erroneous order. Sufficient appears to satisfy the court that the order to starboard was given without due reflection, and that the attempt to correct the error by directing the wheelsman to port the helm was not given in season to prevent the disaster, as the steamer in the meantime had fallen off more than three points.
66
67
By the sailing-rules the steamer was bound to keep out of the way, and the whole evidence shows that she did not comply with that requirement, and the rule of decision in such case is that, prim a facie, the steamer is in fault; nor does the case rest merely upon that presumption, for several reasons: (1.) Because the evidence shows affirmatively that the order to starboard given by the officer in charge of the deck was an improper order. (2.) Because the lookout of the steamer was negligent in the performance of his duty. (3.) Because the steamer did not slacken her speed nor stop and reverse in season to accomplish the object contemplated by the enactment containing that requirement.
67
68
II. Attempt is made in argument to show that the schooner also was in fault, and that the case falls within the rule which requires that the damages shall be divided.
68
69
Support to that charge is attempted to be drawn from the assumed fact that the schooner changed her course in violation of the rule of navigation which requires the sail-ship to keep her course, as a correlative duty to that of the steamer whenever the latter is required to keep out of the way. Such undoubtedly is the general rule of navigation, but it is subject to the qualification that it does not apply in such a case when a departure from it is necessary to avoid immediate danger.10
69
70
Two answers are made by the libellants to that defence, either of which if found to be true is sufficient to exonerate the schooner from the consequences of the accusation, if proved to be well founded: (1.) That the evidence invoked for the purpose does not establish the charge. (2.) That the schooner made no change in her course until the collision was inevitable, nor until it became indispensably necessary in order to avoid immediate danger caused by the fault of the steamer.
70
 All must admit that the burden to establish the charge is upon the claimants. They examined witnesses belonging to the steamer to support the theory of the defence, but the remark is applicable to them all that their cross-examination showed that they had no actual knowledge upon the subject, that they inferred that the charge was true from the fact that the two vessels collided, and from the manner in which they came together.
71
72
On the other hand all the persons on the deck of the schooner were examined by the libellants, and they testify, with one accord, that the schooner did not change her course as alleged by the claimants. Two of those, to wit, the wheelsman and the master who stood by his side, must know what did take place in that regard, and unless they have wilfully stated what they know to be false their statements must be correct; nor can it be denied that they state in the most positive terms that the charge is untrue. They were on the deck of the schooner and had the opportunity to know everything which occurred around them, nor can they well be mistaken in respect to the matter in question, but the witnesses on the steamer only infer what transpired on the deck of the schooner, and of course their statements are in the nature of opinions, and are certainly entitled to much less credit than such as are founded in actual knowledge of what did take place.
72
73
Mere inference from the circumstances of the collision is not reliable, since it is fully proved that the steamer attempted in the first place to go to the left and then ported her helm and attempted to go to the right; nor is it correct to suppose that the angle of the steamer when she struck the port side of the schooner was towards the stem of the schooner, as the proof is quite satisfactory that it was towards the stern.
73
74
Some of the witnesses state that the steamer struck the schooner at right angles, but the better opinion is that it was with a slight angle in the opposite direction from that found by the district judge, if his opinion is correctly exhibited in the record. Strong confirmation of that view is derived from the conceded fact that it was the port side of the stem of the steamer that was injured by the concussion. She cut three or four feet into the schooner just forward of her main rigging, and being herself injured on the port side of her stem the inference is a reasonable one that she was heading somewhat towards the stern of the schooner.
74
 Be that as it may, it still is insisted by the claimants that the schooner changed her course and violated the sailing-rule which forbids it, but the evidence is not sufficient to establish the charge nor to render it probable that anything of the kind occurred, unless perhaps at the moment before the collision, when the master, seeing that the peril was impending, took the wheel from the helmsman and gave the order 'let go her gaff-topsail sheet and lower the peak,' but the order was not obeyed, as there was no time to execute it before the steamer struck the schooner.
75
76
Rules of navigation continue to be applicable as long as the means and opportunity remain to avoid the danger, but they do not apply to a vessel required to keep her course after the wrongful approach of the opposite vessel is so near that the collision is inevitable. Steamers under the rule that they shall keep out of the way must of necessity determine for themselves and upon their own responsibility, independent of the sailing-vessel, whether it is safer to go to the right or left or to slacken their speed or stop and reverse, and in order that the steamer may not be deprived of the means of determining the matter wisely, and that she may not be defeated or baffled in the attempt to perform her duty in the emergency, it is required that the sailing-vessel shall keep her course and allow the steamer to pass either on the right or left, or to adopt such other measures of precaution as she may deem best suited to enable her to perform her duty and fulfil the requirement to keep out of the way.
76
77
These rules of navigation are of great importance, but they do not apply to the vessel required to keep her course after the wrongful approach of the steamer is so near that the collision is inevitable, nor will an error committed by the sail-vessel under such circumstances of peril, if she is otherwise without fault, impair the right of the sail-vessel to recover for the injuries occasioned by the collision, for the plain reason that those who produced the peril and put the sail-vessel in that situation are chargeable with the error and must answer for the consequences.11
77
78
Subject to that exception the sail-vessel must keep her course, but the case before the court, if any change was made in the course of the schooner, falls within the exception, and it follows that the decree of the Circuit Court must be reversed, with costs, and the cause remanded with directions to enter a decree in favor of the libellants for the whole value of the schooner, her freight, and cargo.

THE COLLECTOR
v.
RICHARDS.
October Term, 1874
1
The court below decided that the case was to be governed by the act of and that the act of did not cover or embrace it. The correctness of this decision is now before us for review.
1
2
Of course the act last in date must prevail if it covers the case. Its language is, therefore, to be carefully examined. The important words of the first section are as follows:
2
3
'The value of foreign coin, as expressed in the money of account of the United States, shall be that of the pure metal of such coin of standard value.'
3
4
The plain meaning of this language is, that the value of foreign coins, in United States money, shall be mea ured by the amount of pure metal contained therein when of standard value; that is, when of the weight and fineness required by the laws and regulations of the country where they are produced. This value having been duly ascertained and published by the superintendent of the mint and the Secretary of the Treasury, becomes the rule in the cases and for the purposes to which, according to the fair meaning of the act, it is to be applied. In what cases and to what purposes it is to be applied is not expressed by the statute, but is to be gathered from its general terms, from the context, and from an examination of other statutes passed in pari materi a. The government contends that it is to be applied in all cases where the estimation of the value of foreign moneys of account is required by law; and that its principal and perhaps most important purpose is the very one in question, namely, the estimation of the invoice values of imported goods chargeable with ad valorem duties.
4
5
This would seem to be, prim a facie, the correct construction of the act. The second section proceeds, at once, without any inquiry of the Director of the Mint, or any further investigation of the subject, to adopt this very method of computing the value of the sovereign or pound sterling, the most important foreign coin with which the financial operations of this country are concerned, and to direct that such computation shall be applied to the valuation of invoices of imported goods, and to other specified cases in which the value of the pound sterling is necessary to be ascertained. The value of the sovereign or pound sterling, fixed by this section is four dollars, eighty-six cents, six and a half mills. This is precisely its standard value computed in reference to the amount of pure metal contained in it when of standard value according to the mint regulations of England, and estimating that metal according to the amount contained in the United States dollar. Although the sovereign, or pound sterling, as a coin has only existed since the year the amount of pure gold contained in the pound sterling (estimating the guinea at twenty-one shillings) has been grains ever since the year and as the United States dollar contains grains of pure metal, it only requires a process of simple division to show that the value of the sovereign is precisely what the second section of the act determines it to be. This intrinsic value of the pound sterling, as represented by the gold coins of England, was a matter of such public notoriety as to need no extraneous inquiry on the subject. It was the public law of the British empire during the period of our own colonial history, of which all our courts were required to take judicial notice; and its continuance to the present time is a public fact as well established as any other act of the British government. In addition to this, the Finance Committee of the Senate, in reporting the act of stated the value of the pound sterling, computed in the manner referred to, as an ascertained fact. There were also other reasons, if any were needed, having respect to the fictitious par of exchange so long persisted in by the bankers of both countries, which made it expedient for Congress itself to fix the value of the pound sterling. But the material fact in this inquiry is, that it fixed that value on precisely the same principle which it is claimed by the government is laid down in the first section for ascertaining the value of all other foreign coins, and specified the purposes to which such valuation should be applied, amongst which is that of computing the value of invoices of imported goods. And it seems to us clear that the two sections have, in this regard, substantially the same objects in view; that it was the object of the first section to establish a method of computing the value of other foreign coins, similar to that employed in the second section in computing the value of the sovereign, and to apply such computation in the same cases and for he same purposes. Otherwise there would exist two differing metholds of computing the values of foreign coins, and two differing rules for estimating the values of goods imported from different countries, giving a different value to goods imported from one country from that given to goods of the same cost imported from another country.
5
6
And it seems to us (although that is a matter of legislative cognizance) that the statute adopts the true method of computing the value of foreign money. The basis of our dollar of account (when not affected by the exceptional condition of legal-tender notes) is the standard gold dollar of grains, containing one-tenth alloy. The actual coinage in circulation may be slightly diminished in value by abrasion, and this may have some effect on the dollar of account. But the same thing is true in other countries as the assays at the mint have shown; and the true method of comparing their money of account with ours, when both are based on actual coin, is to compare the standard coins of the two countries in a perfect state, and to ascertain the actual amount of pure metal in each. This is the result at which Congress seems to have arrived, and, as we think, wisely.
6
7
In making the comparison of the moneys of different countries their gold coins, if they have such, are employed for the purpose; gold having become the general medium of international exchange, whilst silver is regarded more as a domestic coin, and is usually made a legal tender for only limited amounts. This practice, together with the rejection of the alloy from the estimate, is in accordance with the rules laid down on the subject by the most enlightened economists.
7
8
Computed in the manner required by the law, the value of the franc is ascertained to be nineteen cents and three mills, as contended for by the government. This is the result of the examination and estimate made by the Director of the Mint and announced by the Secretary of the Treasury.
8
9
But the defendants in error insist that an examination of prior statutes on the subject of coins and their valuation, demonstrates that the act of was not intended to fix the value of the franc or of other foreign coins for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of invoices of imported goods, but for the purpose of giving general information on the subject, or of estimating the value of contracts in legal proceedings, or for some other purpose.
9
10
We have carefully examined the statutes for the purpose of ascertaining the soundness of this suggestion, but have failed to see anything in the legislation on the subject requiring us to adopt it. It is true that some of the laws have had for object simply the valuation of foreign coins for the use of the custom-house in computing the amount of invoices; others have fixed the value of such coins when receivable in payment of public dues, or when used as legal tenders in the payment of debts; and others have had still other purposes and objects. But how this general fact can affect the express mandatory terms of the act of we fail to perceive. Those terms are that the value of foreign coin, as expressed in the money of account of the United States, shall be that of the pure metal of such coin of standard value. This simple and sensible rule abrogates previous regulations on the subject. It is inconsistent with them, and the third section of the act expressly repeals all acts and parts of acts inconsistent with its provisions. No resort to a repeal by implication is necessary.
10
11
Of course the act of does not make foreign coins receivable in cases where they were not receivable before; but where they are receivable, or where their value is material to be known, the rule for ascertaining that value is clearly laid down and determined by the law. It is true it does not itself fix the values of foreign coins except in a single instance where special reasons require it; and it is doubtful whether the attempt to do so would have been as judicious as the method adopted. Those values a e now to be carefully ascertained and publicly announced by the proper officers of the government. This method will insure the greatest accuracy, and will be attended with many public benefits. It is just, both to the government and the importer, because it is founded on truth; and it will be a great convenience to all persons who have any transactions in which the value of foreign money is in any way involved.

THE TREMOLO PATENT.
TREMAINE
v.
HITCHCOCK & CO.
HITCHCOCK & CO.
v.
TREMAINE.
October Term, 1874
1
ON cross appeals from the Circuit Court for the Southern District of New York.
1
2
Hitchcock & Co., owners by assignment of a patent to one Carpenter, which had been twice reissued to themselves, filed a bill in the court below against Tremaine and others, vendors of organs generally and other musical instruments, to enjoin their sale of what was known as a 'tremolo attachment,' an appendage sometimes made to organs; the purpose of which is to make a tremolo or vibratory note, preserving at the same time, as far as possible, its smoothness, fulness, and power.
2
3
This tremolo attachment was no necessary part of an organ; but, as its name declared, an attachment;' an optional device, used or not used at pleasure.
3
4
The defendants, who, as already said, were venders of organs generally, and who bought different sorts of organs from the different makers of them, had and sold organs with the attachment (buying them from persons not licensed), and organs without the attachment. For those containing the attachment they paid an additional price, and they sold them also for more than those which did not have the attachment.
4
5
The defendants answered the bill, and the case having been heard, and they decreed guilty of infringement, it was referred to a master to take an account of profits, the order of reference directing——
5
6
'That the permit the defendants to prove the general expenses of their business incurred alike to effect the sale of all goods (i. e., not specifically incurred in reference to any particular class or kind), said general expenses to be apportioned by the master, and a part of the same, bearing the same proportion to the whole that the gross sum received from sales of the infringement bears to the gross sum received by the defendants from all sales in their said business, to be added to the expense of the infringing tremolos, and allowed to the defendants.'
6
7
In taking this account, the master did accordingly allow the defendants to prove the general expenses of their business incurred in effecting the sales of all musical instruments, and deduct a ratable proportion from the profits made by the sale tremolo attachments. To explain, he reported thus:'1st. That the gross sum received by the defendants from all sales in their said business, during the period specified, was $.
7
8
'2d. That the gross sum received by the defendants from sales of the infringement was $.
8
9
'3d. That the general expenses of their business incurred alike to effect the sales of all goods was $.
9
10
'4th. That the proportion of such general expenses applicable to the tremolo, pursuant to said order, is $.
10
11
'5th. That if said proportionable part of the expenses be added to the expense of the tremolo, or deducted from the profits previously reported, to wit, $ the profit derived by the defendants from the infringing tremolo will amount to the sum of $'
11
12
No detailed statement of general expenses was offered before the master on the part of the defendants, nor did they prove specific items of general expense, except the items of rent, salaries, freight, and cartage, advertising, insurance, gas, and fuel. They made a general statement, however, and introduced their books in cross-examination. Both parties submitted analysis of these books. The master adopted the figures of the defendants' analysis except, where he considered them at variance with the previous sworn testimony, and he allowed as general expenses certain sums and items, including:
12
13
And disallowed eight various large items.
13
t. To the deduction from the profits made on the sale of the tremolo attachments of a ratable proportion of the general expenses of the defendants' business.
14
. To the way in which the master ascertained the general expenses.
15
16
The court, however, confirmed the master's report, and a decree was entered accordingly.
16
17
Soon after this was done, it was discovered that the case had been tried on issues not made in the pleadings; that the complainants in taking their proofs had put in evidence a reissue different from and later than the one which they had set out in their bill as the ground for their complaint, and that the bill had never in any way been amended.
17
18
As to this new matter now brought up after decree made, the case was thus:
18
19
The bill set forth that a patent for the 'attachment' had been granted on the 27th day of June, 1865, to one Carpenter; that subsequently he assigned the letters- atent to the complainants; that on the 18th day of May, 1869, they surrendered the patent, and obtained a reissue to themselves (No. , and that the defendants had been guilty of infringing their rights under the patent.
19
20
To the complaint thus exhibited the defendants answered, admitting the grant of the letters to Carpenter, but denying all knowledge as to the truth of the allegations that Carpenter had at any time assigned his interest to the complainants, or to any one or more of them; and, therefore, denying that the complainants had any interest in the said letters-patent or to the 'reissues' of the same as set forth in the bill of complaint. The answer further averred that Carpenter was not the original inventor of the tremolo attachment, but that it was known and was in use before his alleged invention was made. It denied that the defendants had infringed upon the rights and privileges granted by the patent dated June 'or by ANY of the reissues of the same.'
20
21
To this answer a general replication was put in and the parties went to trial, when the complainants gave in evidence, without objection, reissued letters-patent No. dated October which had been granted on the surrender of the first reissue No. This second reissue was not set out in the bill, but it was obvious enough that both parties supposed it was, through all the progress of the trial. As already said, the answer denied infringement, not of the single reissue mentioned in the bill, but of any of the resissues. No other reissue than No. was put in evidence. The decretal order to account mentioned it in terms. The evidence taken by the master under the order of reference related only to attachments sold by the defendants after the second reissue was granted. In the exceptions taken by them to the master's report no intimation was made that the rights of the complainants under the reissue No. were not on trial, and not even when the final decree was made was it suggested that the parties had been trying the case on an issue not made by the pleadings.
21
22
After the final decree had been made, the complainants applied to have the bill of complaint amended by inserting in it a declaration on the reissued letters-patent which were decreed to be valid, and the court below made an order containing a recitation of alleged facts to authorize the order amending the bill as prayed for.
22
23
There was no allegation that the bill of complaint ever contained the allegation as to reissue No. prior to the judgment. The motion and the order were not made 'to conform the bill to the proofs.'
23
24
Both parties appealed; the complainants because of the confirmation of the report in the face of their two exceptions to it; the defendants because of the amendment allowed in the bill after a final decree made.
24
25
Mr. F. H. Betts, for the complainants below:
25
 No part of the general expenses are justly allowable to the defendants.
26
27
The method of computation of profits was erroneous. It forgot that the patent is not for the tremolo itself, but for the combination of the organ and tremolo.
27
28
If an extra price is received for the combination, without any additional expense being incurred, the whole of that extra price is obtained by the addition of the combination.
28
29
It does not avail the defendants to charge a portion of their general expenses against the tremolo, one member of the combination, for in so doing they take off the exact amount from the other member, the organ. The profit on the whole combination is still equal to the exact amount by which the extra price received by reason of the making of the addition exceeds the amount received for the organ alone. This, for example, is expressed in figures thus:
29
30
Cost of organ, $ received for organ, $ Cost of tremolo, $ received for tremolo, $25. Amount of general expenses apportioned to each organ, $50; no additional amount incurred by reason of tremolo.
30
31
If all, $50 i charged against organ alone. Profit on tremolo alone is $is charged on organ and $5 on tremolo, we still have $as the profit received for the combination; i. e., $on tremolo itself and $5 on organ, by reason of adding tremolo.
31
32
The same result follows from any apportionment.
32
33
Any other rule than this would enable an infringer to add patented devices to his instrument, charge extra prices for them, and thereby increase his profit on his instruments by the exact amount of the proportion of his general expenses that his sales of the infringing device bear to his general business. In other words, the more he infringes the more of the general expenses he diverts from the main instrument, and thereby the more profits he makes without being accountable for it.
33
34
The true rule is, if the infringing devices are an integral part of the whole instrument, without which it is incapable of use, and for which a single charge is made, then in determining profits on a part of the organization general expenses are to be apportioned according to cost, or by some other equitable rule.
34
35
But when the infringing device is an optional one, used or not, at pleasure, and an extra price is charged and received for it when used, the true profit made is the extra sum received for the addition, only such expenses being allowed as are incurred by reason of the addition.
35
36
It may be urged that as the tremolos induced the sale of organs, and as the sale of organs involved expense, therefore the tremolo must bear its proportion of such expense. This is a plausible position, but in this case the sales of organs produced a profit beyond the profit of the tremolo. Every sale of an organ which was induced by the presence of a tremolo, instead of creating an expense which lessened that part of the profit measured by the difference between the cost and sale price of the tremolo, not only wholly paid such expense, but added additional profit for the organ. If it be the fact, as it doubtless was, that the presence of the tremolo combination increased the sales of organs, so far from the tremolo combination being charged with anything on that account, it ought to be credited, not only with the difference between its cost and sale price, but also with the additional net profit on the whole instrument whose sale was thereby effected.1
36
37
If it would have been impossible to have sold any organs without the tremolo, the whole net profit would have been properly credited to the tremolo.
37
38
If half the sales were due to the tremolo combination, to the tremolo is due the profit caused by its own extra price plus one-half of the balance of net profit on the whole instrument, and if the addition of the combination produced no effects, yet still in fairness it ought to be credited with its own extra profit, and not charged with any part of expenses it contributed nothing to incur.
38
39
The contingency of the presence of the tremolo having retarded sales is not supposable in this case; but if it were, it should still be credited with its own profit and charged with any loss on sales of the whole instrument.
39
 'The master erred in that he has allowed as part of the expenses of business, to be apportioned as general expenses, and has credited a part thereof to the defendants, against the said infringement, the following items:
40
41
"1st. Stationery and printing. $.
41
. Telegraphing. ............ 
42
. Office furniture and fixtures. 
43
h. Expenses. ................ 
44
45
'Whereas he ought not to have credited the defendants, or taken into the account any portion of said sums, because said defendants did not prove what part, if any, of said expenses were allowable under the order of reference.'
45
46
If a proportion of the general expenses are o be deducted, then the defendants must bring themselves within the order, and, in regard to that order, the following things are to be noted:
46
 A division of expenses is to be made into 'general' and 'particular.'
47
48
The 'general' expenses being those incurred for all goods alike, such as rent, clerk hire, general advertising, &c., the particular expenses being those caused by certain particular goods, and not by reason of selling all the goods, such as cartage on particular instruments, commission of particular sales, &c.
48
 The burden of distinguishing between these two classes is upon the defendants. To them alone were the facts known, and it was just and proper that they, and not the complainants, should be required to prove them.
49
50
The defendants, by the order, were to be 'permitted' to prove their 'general' expenses, as distinguished from the particular ones. Unless they showed, therefore, what their 'general' expenses were as distinguished from 'particular' ones, the master had nothing to do but to report as before.
50
51
The defendants show generally that they had incurred certain items of expense, i. e., stationery, printing, telegraphing, expressage, labor, &c.
51
52
Now, each and all of these items may be items of general expense, or they may be particular expense, or they may be part one and part the other.
52
53
The defendants have failed to show what part of these expenses is 'general' and what part 'particular;' they have failed to do this, and therefore the itmes should be disallowed.
53
 The amendment even after final decree was properly made.
54
55
It is perfectly plain from the statement of the case that all parties, complainants, defendants, and court proceeded upon an assumption that the bill was founded on the reissue No. To defeat a suit in such a case would be acting quite too technically.
55
56
If the complainants showed a title to the reissue on which the bill was founded, it would be worth while to consider the two exceptions which they make to the master's report; and to show, as we easily could, that the master's report was made on right principles, and the deductions allowed by him in our favor rightly allowed. But the complainants show no title at all under the reissue No. on which they base their bill. It had been surrendered. The surrender is a solemn declaration that that reissue was void. It has not been and could not be put in evidence. On the other hand, an issue which has been put in evidence is not relied on in the bill, nor indeed so much as referred to in it. A final decree is made on the unproduced, non-existent, and void reissue set forth in the bill, and after final decree the bill is amended so as to let in the proofs. Such an amendment is in the face of all rules and all practice in equity.
56
57
It was not an amendment of mere form, but was an amendment of substance, inasmuch as a separate and distinct subject-matter of litigation was introduced.
57
58
No matter what the amendment sought, inasmuch as it was sought after replication, the complainants were not at liberty to amend except on affidavits reciting, among other things, that 'the matter of the proposed amendment could not with reasonable diligence have been introduced sooner into the bill.'2
58
59
In the absence of special rules, it is well-settled law that a bill in equity cannot be amended after the cause is set down for hearing, in any other respect than by making parties.3
59
60
In this cause the amendment was not asked for until after judgment, and the defendants were deprived of the absolute right which they had to file an amended answer or plea.4
60
61
Even if it were urged that the defendants did litigate the patent No. on its merits, and were not prejudiced by the amendment, the answer is that the re ord shows no such state of facts. All the proofs taken by the defendants applied to the reissue No. 
61
62
The defendants were not required to object to the introduction of reissue No. By their answer they required the plaintiffs to prove their title to reissue No. and when the plaintiffs put in evidence the reissue No. it proved the defendants' case for them, because it recited on its face that reissue No. had been surrendered.
62
63
Mr. Justice STRONG delivered the opinion of the court.
63
64
We think that the order of the court directing that the record be amended by inserting in the bill an averment of the second reissue was properly made, under the circumstances of the case, though made after the final decree. For practically the rights of the complainants under the second reissue, and the defendants' infringement thereof were in issue under the answer and the replication. The amendment deprived the defendants of no rights which they had not enjoyed during all the progress of the trial. It may well be denominated only an amendment of form, because it introduced no other cause of action than that which had been tried. It is true that an amendment which changes the character of the bill ought not generally to be allowed after a case has been set for a hearing, and still less after it has been heard. The reason is that the answer may become inapplicable if such an amendment be permitted. But in this case the defendants were not prejudiced. They had every advantage they could have had, if the bill had originally averred the second reissue. The case is undoubtedly anomalous, but we think justice would not be subserved by denying to the Circuit Court the power to order such an amendment as was made, after the cause was tried precisely as it must have been tried if the bill had originally contained the averment inserted by the amendment.
64
65
We come then to the errors assigned by the complainants. They relate to the estimate of profits reported by the master and confirmed by the court. The defendants were vendors of musical instruments, including organs and melodeons, which they purchased from the manufacturers. Some of these instruments contained the tremolo attachment, and others did not. For those containing such attachments they paid an additional price and they sold them also for an increased price. In the ascertainment of the profits made by them from the sales, they were allowed to prove the general expenses of their business incurred in effecting the sales of all musical instruments, and deduct a ratable proportion from the profits made by the sale of tremolo attachments. It is of this allowance the complainants now complain. It is said the patent infringed was not for the tremolo itself, but for the combination of the organ and tremolo, and it is argued that if the defendants obtained an extra price for the organ combined with the tremolo without incurring any additional expense, the whole of that extra price was obtained from the addition of the combination. And it is further insisted that the true rule in cases like the present is that if the infringing device is an integral part of the whole instrument, without which it is incapable of use, and for which a single charge is made, then in ascertaining profits on a part of the organization general expenses are to be apportioned according to the cost, or by some other equitable rule. But when the infringing device is an optional one, used or not at pleasure, and an extra price is charged and received for it when used, the true profit made is the extra sum received for the addition, deducting only such expenses as are incurred by reason of the addition. We think such a rule, even if it may sometimes be just, is inapplicable to the present case. We cannot see why the general expenses incurred by the defendants in carrying on their business, such expenses as store rent, clerk hire, fuel, gas, porterage, &c., do not concern one part of their business as much as another. It may be said that the selling a tremolo attachment did not dd to their expenses, and therefore that no part of those expenses should be deducted from the price obtained for such an attachment. This is, however, but a partial view. The store rent, the clerk hire, &c., may, it is true, have been the same, if that single attachment had never been bought or sold. So it is true that the general expenses of their business would have been the same, if instead of buying and selling one hundred organs, they had bought and sold only ninety-nine. But will it be contended that because buying and selling an additional organ involved no increase of the general expenses, the price obtained for that organ above the price paid was all profit? Can any part of the whole number sold be singled out as justly chargeable with all the expenses of the business? Assuredly no. The organ with a tremolo attachment is a single piece of mechanism, though composed of many parts. It was bought and sold as a whole by the defendants. It may be said the general expenses of the business would have been the same if any one of these parts had been absent from the instrument sold. If, therefore, in estimating profits, every part is not chargeable with a proportionate share of the expenses, no part can be. But such a result would be an injustice that no one would defend. We think it very plain, therefore, that there was no error in the rule adopted for the ascertainment of the profits made by the defendants out of their infringement of the complainants' patent.
65
66
We think also the master's report, confirmed by the court, was correct in its ascertainment of the general expenses. At least there is nothing before us to show that it did not conform to the second decretal order. The defendants submitted analyses of their books, from which it is to be presumed the master distinguished general from particular expenses.
66
67
It follows that neither the appeal of the defendants nor the cross appeal of the complainants can be sustained.
67
68
DECREE AFFIRMED; the costs of each appeal to be paid by the appellants.

The State of Wisconsin, by act of its legislature, accepted the grant thus made, and assumed the execution of the trust. The route of the road was surveyed, and a map of its location was filed in the land office at Washington. The adjoining odd sections within the prescribed limits were then withdrawn from sale by the proper officers of the government, and certified lists thereof, approved by the Secretary of the Interior, were delivered to the State.
5
6
Subsequently, on the 5th of May, 1864, Congress passed another act on the same subject, entitled 'An act granting lands to aid in the construction of certain railroads in the State of Wisconsin.'2 By its first section additional land was granted to the State upon the same terms and conditions contained in the previous act, for the purpose of aiding in the construction of a railroad from a point on the St. Croix River or lake, between townships twenty-five and thirty-one, to the west end of Lake Superior, and from some point on the line of said railroad, to be selected by the State, to Bayfield, and the time for the completion of the road, as mentioned in the previous act, was extended for the period of five years from the passage of the last act. The State, through its legislature, accepted this grant also.
6
7
There were also some other grants made by the act for other railroads.
7
8
The road here mentioned, and which is a part of the road designated in the act of has never been constructed, nor has any part of it been constructed, and Congress has not passed any act since extending the time for its construction. Nor has Congress passed any act, nor have any judicial proceedings been taken by any branch of the government to enforce a forfeiture of the grants for failure to construct the road within the period prescribed.
8
9
The complaint in the case alleged property and right of possession in the plaintiffs. The answer among other matters traversed these allegations.
9
10
It was stipulated by the parties that the plaintiffs were in the quiet and peaceable possession of the logs at the time of their seizure by the defendant, and that such possession should be conclusive evidence of title in the plaintiffs against evidence of title in a stranger, unless the defendant should connect himself with such title by agency or authority in himself, and that the seizure of the property by the defendant was, so far as the manner of making the same was concerned, valid and legal in all respects, as though made under and by virtue of legal process, the evidence object of the stipulation being to test the right of the parties to the property independent of the manner of its seizure.
10
11
By an act of the legislature of Wisconsin of March the governor of the State was authorized to appoint competent persons as agents of the State, whose duty it was made to preserve and protect the timber growing upon the lands granted by the acts of Congress, and to take into possession on behalf of the State any logs and timber which might be cut on or carried away from those premises without lawful authority, wherever the same might be.
11
12
The evidence showed that defendant was appointed agent of the State under this act, and that as such agent he seized the logs for which the present action was brought; that the logs were, during the years floated from the places where they were cut down the river St. Croix into a boom at Stillwater, in the State of Minnesota, and were there intermingled with other logs of similar character and marks belonging to the plaintiffs, so that the particular logs cut on the lands granted to the State could not be distinguished from logs cut on other lands; that the boom from which the defendant seized the logs in suit was two and a half miles long, and from one to three-fourths of a mile wide, and contained about three hundred millions of feet of pine logs; that the defendant before the seizure demanded of the plaintiffs the logs cut on the lands granted, and the plaintiffs refused to deliver them.
12
13
The defendant contended in support of the seizure and of his right to the possession of the property——
13
t. That the act of Congress of June and the first section of the act of May passed the legal title to the lands designated therein to the State of Wisconsin in trust for the construction of the railroad mentioned.
14
. That the lands designated have not reverted to the United States, although the road was not constructed within the period prescribed, no judicial proceedings nor any act on the part of the government having been taken to forfeit the grants.
15
. That the legal title to the lands being in the State, it was the owner of the logs cut thereon, and could authorize the defendant as its agent to take possession of them wherever found; and,
16
h. That under the law of Minnesota, the plaintiffs having mingled the logs cut by them on the lands of the State with other logs belonging to them, so that the two classes could not be distinguished, the defendant had a right, after demand upon the plaintiffs, to take from the mass a quantity of logs equal to those which were cut on the lands of the State.
17
18
The plaintiffs controverted these several positions, and contended besides that under the stipulation of the parties and the pleadings in the case, no proof of title in the State was admissible; and that if the acts of Congress vested a title in the State that title was transferred by the nineteenth section of an act of its legislature, passed March to the St. Croix and Superior Railroad Company, a corporation then created for the purpose of constructing the railroads designated in those acts. That section was as follows:
18
19
'For the purpose of aiding in the construction of the railway hereby incorporated, the State of Wisconsin hereby transfers unto said company all the rights, title, interest, and estate, legal or equitable, now owned by the State in the lands heretofore conditionally granted to the St. Croix and Superior Railroad Company, for the construction of a railroad and branches; and . . does further grant, transfer, and convey unto the said railway company . . the possession, right, title, interest, and estate which the said State of Wisconsin may now have or shall hereafter acquire of, in, or to any lands, through gift, grant, or transfer from the United States, or by any act of the Congress of the United States, amending 'An act granting a portion of the public lands to the State of Wisconsin to aid in the construction of a railroad, approved June ' and the act or acts amendatory thereof, or by any future acts of the Congress of the United States granting lands to the State of Wisconsin, so far as the same may apply to, and in the construction of, a railroad from Bayfield, in the county of Bayfield, in a southwesterly direction, to the intersection of the main line of the Northern Wisconsin Railway, from the lake or river St. Croix to Superior, to have and to hold such lands, and the use, possession, and fee in the same, upon the express condition to construct the herein described railway within the several terms and spaces of time set forth and specified in the next preceding section of this act; and upon the construction and completion of every twenty miles of said railway the said company shall acquire the fee simple absolute in and to all that portion of lands granted to this State in any of the ways hereinbefore described by the Congress of the United States, appertaining to that portion of the railway so constructed and completed.'
19
20
The following provisions of law are in force in Minnesota, and were in force when the logs in suit were seized by the defendant:'SECTION 2. In cases where logs or timber bearing the same mark, but belonging to different owners in severalty, have, without fault of any of them, become so intermingled that the particular or identical logs or timber belonging to each cannot be designated, either of such owners may, upon a failure of any one of them, having possession, to make a just division thereof, after demand, bring and maintain against such one in possession an action to recover his proportionate share of said logs or timber, and in such action he may claim and have the immediate delivery of such quantity of said logs or timber as shall equal his said share, in like manner and with like force and effect as though such quantity embraced his identical logs and timber and no other.'3
20
21
The court below being of opinion in favor of the defendant, on the different points raised, he obtained judgment that he recover possession of the property which had been replevied from him after his seizure of the same, or the sum of $ their value and costs. To reverse this judgment the plaintiffs brought the case here on writ of error.
21
22
Mr. E. C. Palmer, for the plaintiff in error:
22
23
I. Under the pleadings and stipulation evidence of title in the State was inadmissible.4
23
24
When the defendant in replevin claims a return of the property replevied, he occupies, as to his own title or claim, the position of a plaintiff.5 His answer, therefore, should set up the same facts substantially which would be required in a complaint.
24
25
II. The court below improperly held that the legal title to the lands embraced in the acts of Congress of June and May still remained in the State of Wisconsin.
25
 The acts of Congress did not constitute a grant in presenti. The State acquired under them only a permissive right to dispose of said lands, for a defined purpose, upon complying with certain conditions named in the acts, and acquired no title of any degree in the lands. It was not upon the theory that this proposed road was a State need that this appropriation of the national resources was made, but upon the theory that it was a national need. It is true the State of Wisconsin was interested in the results of the improvement, but the national policy of making internal improvements would forbid her to assert that she was more than the local agent of the Federal government in carrying out the object of this appropriation. The purose and end of the grant do not require the construction that the State takes the legal title in presenti, by virtue of the acts. It must be presumed that Congress in passing the acts considered that the general good would be best subserved by such application of a portion of the public lands, and so made provisions, through the agency of the States and their representatives, the railroad companies, to dispense, as the improvements go on, the fund provided to further such object.
26
 It is a general rule that all public grants are to be construed strictly and in favor of the public, and that nothing passes but what is granted in clear and explicit terms.6
27
 That the acts of Congress were not per se a grant in presenti to the State of all the lands therein described, and that a present right, estate, and interest in the same, did not pass by the terms of the acts, is settled by the case in this court of Rice v. Railroad Company.7 There the matter is considered in the interpretation of the grant made by Congress on the 29th of June, 1854, to the Territory of Minnesota; a grant, so far as the present question is concerned, identical with this one.
28
29
III. If the title passed to the State by the said acts, such title reverted to the United States, no part of the road having been built at the expiration of the period limited in the grant.8
29
30
Here was a grant or appropriation of part of the public domain for a defined purpose upon condition that such purpose should be accomplished within a time limited. It was founded upon no consideration unless the road in aid of which the appropriation was made should be built. The lands could not be sold until certain defined portions of the road should be constructed and due proof thereof made to the Secretary of the Interior. At the expiration of the time limited, all lands not patented were to revert to the United States.
30
31
The court below held that such lands did not ipso facto revert to the United States by mere failure to build the road within the period prescribed by the act of Congress; and that to effect the forfeiture some act on the part of the General government evincing an intention to take advantage of such failure is essential.
31
32
This position is met in Rice v. Railroad Company, already cited. The court there says:
32
33
'Neither of the sections . . contain any words which necessarily and absolutely vest in the Territory any beneficial interest in the thing granted. Undoubtedly the words employed are sufficient to have that effect, and if not limited or restricted by the context or other parts of the act, they would properly receive that construction, but the word grant is not a technical word, like the word enfeoff, and although if used broadly without limitation or restriction, it would carry an estate or interest in the thing granted, still it may be used in a more restricted sense, and be so limited that the grantee will take but a mere naked trust or power to dispose of the thing granted and to apply the proceeds arising out of it to the use and benefit of the grantor.'Indeed, public policy demands that the government should not be required to take any step in order to place lands embraced in such public acts, as are now under consideration, in their former condition, at the precise time provided in the act. To require a judicial declaration of forfeiture would clog the free disposition of the public lands, which the government ought at all times to be able to exercise in furtherance of the public interests. And it is not clear how or where such proceeding could be instituted, or who would be necessary parties thereto. An act of Congress, or an order of the Land Department, or Secretary of the Interior, could not conclude any one or divest title previously vested.
33
34
The rule as sometimes applied to private grants rests upon the principle that such grants carry the fee of the land, and the right of actual occupancy for such purposes as the grantee desires to effect, subject however to certain conditions, which, if unperformed, may operate as a defeasance, provided the grantor shall re-enter for condition broken; that the title or interest of the grantee is an estate which can be incumbered or transferred by deed, like other real property, and cannot be diverted except by judicial proceedings instituted for that purpose.
34
35
Under the act of no land could be sold until twenty miles were constructed, and then only those sections which were coterminous with the constructed line, not by the State, but by the companies. No road can be constructed after ten years under the first act, nor after five years from May under the second. Under this act the State possesses no disposing power over the lands by sale or conveyance. Unless, therefore, the State can create or designate certain railroad corporations to receive the grant, there can occur no contingency in which the State would have any duty to perform or any right or power in the premises. Such case, irrespective of the question of legal title, bears no analogy to a private grant, where the estate and power of the grantee are as ample, in the beginning and until reentry or forfeiture judicially declared, as if the grant contained no conditions whatever.
35
36
IV. If the State acquired title by the acts of Congress, that title passed under the legislation of the State, in 1869, to a corporation incorporated to construct the roads.
36
37
The nineteenth section of the act of March (quoted supra, p. 50), was a present grant of the interest of the State. The State after this had no power to protect the land from trespassers or to seize the timber cut.
37
38
V. The defendant could not lawfully seize the logs in controversy, because they could not be identified as the logs cut on the lands of the State.
38
39
The statute of Minnesota has no relation to the action of replevin, and cannot avail the defendant herein, whatever effect it would have upon the measure of damages in an action of trover. At common law the rule is without exception in replevin that the property must be identified, or the action will not lie.
39
40
Messrs. I. C. Sloan, B. J. Stevens, and J. C. Spooner, contra:
40
41
I. Under the pleadings it was competent for the defendant to prove title in a stranger, and in that way to defeat the plaintiffs.9 Such proof went directly to meet a material allegation of the plaintiffs. Proving title in the State of Wisconsin, 'a stranger' would, indeed, under the stipulation, have been insufficient; but when after proving the acceptance by the State of the grants, sufficient evidence was given that the defendant had been the agent of the State for the preservation and protection of the timber growing on the lands embraced in the grants, and that he had authority to so protect them; that his seizure and possession of the logs in controversy were as such agent, and under the authority given him by the State of Wisconsin, pursuant to its laws, it 'connected the defendant with such title by competent evidence of authority or agency in himself.' The evidence was thus competent under the pleadings, material to the issues, strictly proper in itself, and in literal fulfilment of the stipulation.
41
42
II. That the acts of Congress vested an estate in presenti, is proved by Rutherford v. Greene's Heirs, 10 and by other cases.12
42
43
In Rice v. Railroad Company, the act which it was said made the grant, unlike the act of which made the grant here, in terms provided that the title should not vest until the road, or portions thereof, were built. That grant was repealed by Congress before any disposition of it became operative, and it was held by a majority of this court that the act vested in the Territory 'a mere naked trust or power to dispose of the lands in the manner therein specified,' and until the power was in fact executed was the subject of repeal, but that if the clause providing that the title should not vest, &c., had been omitted, it would have been similar to the grant considered in Lessieur v. Price, and been 'a present grant.' The case is plainly distinguishable from ours, and in fact accords with the judgment below.
43
44
III. It is argued in effect that the words in the act, 'shall revert to the United States,' were intended as a declaration of forfeiture in advance. But until forfeiture has been incurred, it is not competent for the legislature to declare it; because the legislature cannot know in advance whether or not it may not wish to waive the forfeiture. The words are merely definitive of the condition, for the non-performance of which the legislature may thereafter declare a forfeiture, and are to be construed in connection with the whole act, and in the light of the objects to be accomplished thereby.
44
45
In the case of United States v. Repentigny,13 the corresponding words were, 'and that in default thereof, the same shall be reunited to his Majesty's domain;' words equally imperative with those of the act in question, and yet they were held not to be a declaration of forfeiture, but as definitive of the condition merely.
45
46
Even where the condition provides that the estate shall be void on non-performance, the estate is not defeated without some act or declaration of the grantor.14 This is one of the most ancient principles of the common law assumed as settled in cases reported as far back as Leonard, Sir Francis Moore, Plowden, Coke, and Croke,15 vouching the Year Books, and affirmed by many modern decision.16 In the case of an individual it is by entry; in the case of the government by office found.
46
47
As Congress is the grantor in the case at bar, and has sole authority to dispose of the public domain by grant, Congress alone can declare the intention to enforce the forfeiture. As held by the court in United States v. Repentigny, supra, at act of Congress is an equivalent for office found. The election to waive the forfeiture or to enforce it rests with Congress. It is a question of intention; and no department of the government, either the executive or judicial, can know what the pleasure of Congress may be, and cannot, therefore, treat the title to the lands as revested until Congress has declared its intention in that regard.
47
48
This court will take judicial notice of the proceedings of Congress, and, therefore, we refer to the facts that on two or more occasions Congress has refused to declare and enforce the forfeiture of the grant in question; that bills having passed the House were rejected in the Senate, showing an intention on the part of Congress to waive a forfeiture, if one has in fact been incurred.
48
49
We may also refer to the fact that more than two-thirds of the line of railroad authorized by the act of June has been constructed is recognized and shown by various acts of Congress.
49
50
Conditions subsequent are not favored in law, and are construed strictly.17
50
51
IV. The act of the legislature of Wisconsin of March did not transfer the title to the lands from the State to the railroad company in the way alleged by opposing counsel.
51
 The State could only dispose of the lands in the manner provided by the act of Congress of June that is, as fast as the railroad was constructed. It was thus a trustee, with power of disposal limited by the act creating the trust.
52
 The concluding terms of section nineteen (italicized supra, p. 50), are to be construed with that earlier portion of the section (which might be sufficient in form to convey a present title) and modifies and limits its operation. The specific declaration as to the time when the title in fee should vest, is equivalent to a provision that the fee shall not vest except as the road is constructed.18
53
54
V. The last point made by opposing counsel is answered by the statute of Minnesota, whose words are too plain to be misconstrued.
54
55
Mr. Justice FIELD, after stating the facts of the case, delivered the opinion of the court, as follows:
55
56
The position of the plaintiffs, that under the stipulation of the parties and the pleadings no proof of title in the State to the logs in controversy was admissible, cannot be sustained. The complaint alleges property and right of possession in the plaintiffs; the answer traverses directly these allegations, and under the issue thus formed any evidence was admissible on the part of the defendant which went to show that the plaintiffs had neither property nor right of possession. Evidence of title in the State would meet directly the averment, upon proof of which the plaintiffs could alone recover; and the stipulation was evidently framed upon the supposition that title in the State—for there was no other stranger—would be offered, and it provided for the inconclusiveness of the evidence against the possession of the plaintiffs unless the defendant connected himself with that title. The admitted quiet and peaceable possession of the property by the plaintiffs at the time of the seizure was prim a facie evidence of title, and threw the burden upon the defendant of establishing the contrary.
56
57
The position that if the acts of Congress vested in the State a title to the lands designated, that title was transferred by the act of its legislature, passed March is equally untenable. The State by the terms of the grants from Congress possessed no authority to dispose of the lands beyond one hundred and twenty sections, except as the road, in aid of which the grants were made, was constructed. The company named in the act never constructed any portion of such road, and there is no evidence that the State ever exercised the power to sell the one hundred and twenty sections authorized in advance of such construction. The acts of Congress made it a condition precedent to the conveyance by the State of any other lands, that the road should be constructed in sections of not less than twenty consecutive miles each. No conveyance in violation of the terms of those acts, the road not having been constructed, could pass any title to the company.
57
58
Besides, it is evident, notwithstanding the words of transfer to the company contained in the first part of the nineteenth section of the act of the State, that it was not the intention of the State that the title should pass except upon the construction of the road. Its concluding language is that 'upon the construction and completion of every twenty miles of said railway the said company shall acquire the fee simple absolute in and to all that portion of the land granted' to the State appertaining to the portion of the railway so constructed and completed.
58
59
We proceed, therefore, to the consideration of the several grounds upon which the defendant justifies his seizure of the logs in controversy, and claims a return of them to him.
59
 That the act of Congress of June passed a present interest in the lands designated there can be no doubt. The language used imports a present grant and admits of no other meaning. The language of the first section is, 'that there be, and is hereby, granted to the State of Wisconsin' the lands specified. The third section declares 'that the said lands hereby granted to said State shall be subject to the disposal of the legislature thereof;' and the fourth section provides in what manner sales shall be made, and enacts that if the road be not completed within ten years 'no further sales shall be made, and the lands unsold shall revert to the United States.' The power of disposal and the provision for the lands reverting both imply what the first section in terms declares, that a grant is made, that is, that the title is transferred to the State. It is true that the route of the railroad, for the construction of which the grant was made, was yet to be designated, and until such designation the title did not attach to any specific tracts of land. The title passed to the sections, to be afterwards located; when the route was fixed their location became certain, and the title, which was previously imperfect, acquired precision and became attached to the land.
60
61
In the case of Rutherford v. Greene's Heirs, reported in the second of Wheaton, a similar construction was given by this court to an act of North Carolina, passed in 1782, which provided that twenty-five thousand acres of land should be allotted and given to General Greene and his heirs within the limits of a tract reserved for the use of the army, to be laid off by commissioners appointed for that purpose. The commissioners pursuant to the directions of the act allotted the twenty-five thousand acres and caused the quantity to be surveyed and the survey to be returned to the proper office, and the questions raised in the case related to the validity of the title of General Greene, and the date at which it commenced. The court held that the general gift of twenty-five thousand acres lying in the territory reserved became by the survey a particular gift of the quantity contained in the survey, and concluded an extended examination of the title by stating that it was the clear and unanimous opinion of the court, that the act of vested a title in General Greene to the twenty-five thousand acres to be laid off within the bounds designated, and that the survey made in pursuance of the act gave precision to that title and attached it to the land surveyed.
61
62
On the 6th of March, 1820, Congress passed an act for the admission of Missouri into the Union, and among other regulations to aid the new State, enacted, 'that four entire sections of land be and the same are hereby granted to said State for the purpose of fixing the seat of government thereon, which said sections shall, under the direction of the legislature of said State, be located as near as may be in one body, at any time, in such townships and ranges as the legislature aforesaid may select, on any of the public lands of the United States.' In Lessieur v. Price, reported in the twelfth of Howard, the operation of this act was considered; and the court said:
62
63
'The land was granted by the act of it was a present grant, wanting identity to make it perfect; and the legislature was vested with full power to select and locate the land; and we need only here say, what was substantially said by this court in the case of Rutherford v. Greene's Heirs, that the act of vested a title in the State of Missouri of four sections; and that the selection made by the State legislature pursuant to the act of Congress, and the notice given of such location to the surveyor-general and the register of the local district where the land lay, gave precision to the title, and attached to it the land selected. The United States assented to this mode of proceeding; nor can an individual call it in question.' Numerous other decisions might be cited to the same purport. They establish the conclusion that unless there are other clauses in a statute restraining the operation of words of present grant, these must be taken in their natural sense to import an immediate transfer of title, although subsequent proceedings may be required to give precision to that title and attach it to specific tracts. No individual can call in question the validity of the proceedings by which precision is thus given to the title where the United States are satisfied with them.
63
64
The rules applicable to private transactions, which regard grants of future application—of lands to be afterwards designated as mere contracts to convey, and not as actual conveyances, are founded upon the common law, which requires the possibility of present identification of property to the validity of its transfer. A legislative grant operates as a law as well as a transfer of the property, and has such force as the intent of the legislature requires.
64
65
The case of Rice v. Railroad Company, reported in the first of Black, does not conflict with these views. The words of present grant in the first section of the act there under consideration were restrained by a provision in a subsequent section declaring that the title should not vest in the Territory of Minnesota until the road or portions of it were built.
65
66
The grant of additional land by the first section of the act of Congress of is similar in its language and is subject to the same terms and conditions as the grant by the act of With the other grants, made by the act of we are not concerned in the present case.
66
 The provision in the act of Congress of that all lands remaining unsold after ten years shall revert to the United States, if the road be not then completed, is no more than a provision that the grant shall be void if a condition subsequent be not performed. In Sheppard's Touchstone it is said: 'If the words in the close of conclusion of a condition be thus: that the land shall return to the enfeoffor, &c., or that he shall take it again and turn it to his own profit, or that the land shall revert, or that the feoffor shall recipere the land, these are, either of them, good words in a condition to give a re-entry—as good as the word 're-enter'—and by these words the estate will be made conditional.'19 The prohibition against further sales, if the road be not completed within the period prescribed, adds nothing to the force of the provision. A cessation of sales in that event is implied in the condition that the lands shall then revert; if the condition be not enforced the power to sell continues as before its breach, limited only by the objects of the grant, and the manner of sale prescribed in the act.
67
68
And it is settled law that no one can take advantage of the non-performance of a condition subsequent annexed to an estate in fee, but the grantor or his heirs, or the successors of the grantor if the grant proceed from an artificial person; and if they do not see fit to assert their right to enforce a forfeiture on that ground, the title remains unimpaired in the grantee. The authorities on this point, with hardly an exception, are all one way from the Year Books down. And the same doctrine obtains where the grant upon condition proceeds from the government; no individual can assail the title it has conveyed on the ground that the grantee has failed to perform the conditions annexed.20
68
69
In what manner the reserved right of the grantor for breach of the condition must be asserted so as to restore the estate depends upon the character of the grant. If it be a private grant, that right must be asserted by entry or its equivalent. If the grant be a public one it must be asserted by judicial proceedings authorized by law, the equivalent of an inquest of office at common law, finding the fact of forfeiture and adjudging the restoration of the estate on that ground, or there must be some legislative assertion of ownership of the property for breach of the condition, such as an act directing the possession and appropriation of the property, or that it be offered for sale or settlement. At common law the sovereign could not make an entry in person, and, therefore, an office-found was necessary to determine the estate, but, as said by this court in a late case, 'the mode of asserting or of resuming the forfeited grant is subject to the legislative authority of the government. It may be after judicial investigation, or by taking possession directly under the authority of the government without these preliminary proceedings.'21 In the present case no action has been taken either by legislation or judicial proceedings to enforce a forfeiture of the estate granted by the acts of The title remains, therefore, in the State as completely as it existed on the day when the title by location of the route of the railroad acquired precision and became attached to the adjoining alternate sections.
69
 The title to the land remaining in the State the lumber cut upon the land belonged to the State. Whilst the timber was standing it constituted a part of the realty; being severed from the soil its character was changed; it became personalty, but its title was not affected; it continued as previously the property of the owner of the land, and could be pursued wherever it was carried. All the remedies were open to the owner which the law affords in other cases of the wrongful removal or conversion of personal property.
70
 The logs cut from the lands of the State without license, having been intermingled by the plaintiffs with logs cut from other lands, so as not to be distinguishable, the owner was entitled, under the legislation of Minnesota, and the decisions of her courts, to replevy from the whole mass an amount equal to those cut by the plaintiffs, and the stipulation of the parties provides that the seizure by the defendant, so far as the manner of making the same is concerned, was as valid and legal in all respects as though made under and by virtue of legal process. The remedy thus afforded by the law of Minnesota is eminently just in its operation, and is less severe than that which the common law would authorize.
71
72
We perceive no error in the rulings of the court below, and the judgment is, therefore,
72
73
AFFIRMED.

88 U.S. 264
EXPRESS COMPANY
v.
CALDWELL.
October Term, 1874
1
Notwithstanding the great rigor with which courts of law have always enforced the obligations assumed by common carriers, and notwithstanding the reluctance with which modifications of that responsibility, imposed upon them by public policy, have been allowed, it is undoubtedly true that special contracts with their employers limiting their liability are recognized as valid, if in the judgment of the courts they are just and reasonable—if they are not in conflict with sound legal policy. The contract of a common carrier ordinarily is an assumption by him of the exact duty which the law affixes to the relation into which he enters when he undertakes to carry. That relation the law regards as substantially one of insurance against all loss or damage except such as results from what is denominated the act of God or of the public enemy. But the severe operation of such a rule in some cases has led to a relaxation of its stringency, when the consignor and the carrier agree to such a relaxation. All the modern authorities concur in holding that, to a certain extent, the extreme liability exacted by the common law originally may be limited be express contract. The difficulty is in determining to what extent, and here the authorities differ. Certainly it ought not to be admitted that a common carrier can be relieved from the full measure of that responsibility which ordinarily attends his occupation without a clear and express stipulation to that effect obtained by him from his employer. And even when such a stipulation has been obtained the court must be able to see that it is not unreasonable. Common carriers do not deal with their employers on equal terms. There is, in a very important sense, a necessity for their employment. In many cases they are corporations chartered for the promotion of the public convenience. They have possession of the railroads, canals, and means of transportation on the rivers. They can and they do carry at much cheaper rates than those which private carriers must of necessity demand. They have on all important routes supplanted private carriers. In fact they are without competition, except as between themselves, and that they are thus is in most cases a consequence of advantages obtained from the public. It is, therefore, just that they are not allowed to take advantage of their powers, and of the necessities of the public to exact exemptions from that measure of duty which public policy demands. But that which was public poliey a hundred years ago has undergone changes in the progress of material and social civilization. There is less danger than there was of collusion with highwaymen. Intelligence is more rapidly diffused. It is more easy to trace a consignment than it was. It is more difficult to conceal a fraud. And, what is of equal importance, the business of common carriers has been immensely increased and subdivided. The carrier who receives goods is very often not the one who is expected to deliver them to the ultimate consignees. He is but one link of a chain. Thus his hazard is greatly increased. His employers demand that he shall be held responsible, not merely for his own acts and omissions, and those of his agents, but for those of other carriers whom he necessarily employs for completing the transit of the goods. Hence, as we have said, it is now the settled law that the responsibility of a common carrier may be limited by an express agreement made with his employer at the time of his accepting goods for transportation, provided the limitation be such as the law can recognize as reasonable and not inconsistent with sound public policy. This subject has been so fully considered of late in this court that it is needless to review the authorities at large. In York Company v. The Central Railroad Company,4 it is ruled that the common law liability of a common carrier may be limited and qualified by special contract with the owner, provided such special contract do not attempt to cover losses by negligence or misconduct. And in a still later case, Railroad Company v. Lockwood,5 where the decisions are extensively reviewed, the same doctrine is asserted. The latter case, it is true, involved mainly an inquiry into the reasonableness of an exception stipulated for, but it unequivocally accepted the rule asserted in the first-mentioned case. The question, then, which is presented to us by this record is, whether the stipulation asserted in the defendant's plea is a reasonable one, not inconsistent with sound public policy.
1
2
It may be remarked, in the first place, that the stipulation is not a conventional limitation of the right of the carrier's employer to sue. He is left at liberty to sue at any time within the period fixed by the statute of limitations. He is only required to make his claim within ninety days, in season to enable the carrier to ascertain what the facts are, and having made his claim, he may delay his suit.
2
3
It may also be remarked that the contract is not a stipulation for exemption from responsibility for the defendants' negligence, or for that of their servants. If is freely conceded that had it been such, it would have been against the policy of the law, and inoperative. Such was our opinion in Railroad Company v. Lockwood. A common carrier is always responsible for his negligence, no matter what his stipulations may be. But an agreement that in case of failure by the carrier to deliver the goods, a claim shall be made by the bailor, or by the consignee, within a specified period, if that period be a reasonable one, is altogether of a different character. It contravenes no public policy. It excuses no negligence. It is perfectly consistent with holding the carrier to the fullest measure of good faith, of diligence, and of capacity, which the strictest rules of the common law ever required. And it is intrinsically just, as applied to the present case. The defendants are an express company. We cannot close our eyes to the nature of their business. They carry small parcels, easily lost or mislaid, and not easily traced. They carry them in great numbers. Express companies are modern conveniences, and notoriously they are very largely employed. They may carry, they often do carry hundreds, even thousands of packages daily. If one be lost, or alleged to be lost, the difficulty of tracing it is increased by the fact that so many are carried, and it becomes greater the longer the search is delayed. If a bailor may delay giving notice to them of a loss, or making a claim indefinitely, they may not be able to trace the parcels bailed, and to recover them, if accidentally missent, or if they have in fact been properly delivered. With the bailor the bailment is a single transaction, of which he has full knowledge; with the bailee, it is one of a multitude. There is no hardship in requiring the bailor to give notice of the loss if any, or make a claim for compensation within a reasonable time after he has delivered the parcel to the carrier. There is great hardship in requiring the carrier to account for the parcel long after that time, when he has had no notice of any failure of difficult, if not impossible when the lapse of time has made it difficult, if not impossible to ascertain the actual facts. For these reasons such limitations have been held valid in similar contracts, even when they seem to be less reasonable than in the contracts of common carriers.
3
4
Policies of fire insurance, it is well known, usually contain stipulations that the insured shall give notice of a loss and furnish proofs thereof within a brief period after the fire, and it is undoubted that if such notice and proofs have not been given in the time designated or have not been waived, the insurers are not liable. Such conditions have always been considered reasonable, because they give the insurers an opportunity of inquiring into the circumstances and amount of the loss, at a time when inquiry may be of service. And still more, conditions in policies of fire insurance that no action shall be brought for the recovery of a loss unless it shall be commenced within a specified time, less than the statutory period of limitations, are enforced, as not against any legal policy.6
4
5
Telegraph companies, though not common carriers, are engaged in a business that is in its nature almost, if not quite, as important to the public as is that of carriers. Like common carriers they cannot contract with their employers for exemption from liability for the consequences of their own negligence. But they may by such contracts, or by their rules and regulations brought to the knowledge of their employers, limit the measure of their responsibility to a reasonable extent. Whether their rules are reasonable or unreasonable must be determined with reference to public policy, precisely as in the case of a carrier. And in Wolf v. The Western Union Telegraph Company,7 a case where one of the conditions of a telegraph company, printed in their blank forms, was that the company would not be liable for damages in any case where the claim was not presented in writing within sixty days after sending the message, it was ruled that the condition was binding on an employer of the company who sent his message on the printed form. The condition printed in the form was considered a reasonable one, and it was held that the employer must make claim according to the condition, before he could maintain an action. Exactly the same doctrine was asserted in Young v. The Western Union Telegraph Company.8
5
6
In Lewis v. The Great Western Railway Company,9 which was an action against the company as common carriers, the court sustained as reasonable stipulations in a bill of lading, that 'no claim for deficiency, damage, or detention would be allowed, unless made within three days after the delivery of the goods, nor for loss, unless made within seven days from the time they should have been delivered.' Under the last clause of this condition the onus was imposed upon the shipper of ascertaining whether the goods had been delivered at the time they should have been, and in case they had not, of making his claim within seven days thereafter. In the case we have now in hand the agreement pleaded allowed ninety days from the delivery of the parcel to the company, within which the claim might be made, and no claim was made until four years thereafter. Possibly such a condition might be regarded as unreasonable, if an insufficient time were allowed for the shipper to learn whether the carrier's contract had been performed. But that cannot be claimed here. The parcel was received at Jackson, Tennessee, for delivery at New Orleans. The transit required only about one day. We think, therefore, the limitation of the defendants' common-law liability to which the parties agreed, as averred in the plea, was a reasonable one, and that the plea set up a sufficient defence to the action.
6
7
We have been referred to one case which seems to intimate, and perhaps should be regarded as deciding that a stipulation somewhat like that pleaded here is insufficient to protect the carrier. It is the Southern Express Company v. Caperton.10 There the receipts for the goods contained a provision that there should be no liability for any loss unless the claim therefor should be made in writing, at the office of the company at Stevenson, within thirty days from the date of the receipt, in a statement to which the receipt should be annexed. The receipt was signed by the agent of the company alone. It will be observed that it was a much more onerous requirement of the shipper than that made in the present case, and more than was necessary to give notice of the loss to the carrier. The court, after remarking that a carrier cannot avoid his responsibility by any mere general notice, nor contract for exemption from liability for his negligence or that of his servants, added that he could not be allowed to make a statute of limitations so short as to be capable of becoming a means of fraud; that it was the duty of the 'defendant to deliver the package to the consignee, and that it was more than unreasonable to allow it to appropriate the property of another by a failure to perform a duty, and that too under the protection of a writing signed only by its agent, the assent to which by the other party was only proven by his acceptance of the paper.' This case is a very unsatisfactory one. It appears to have regarded the stipulation as a statute of limitations, which it clearly was not, and it leaves us in doubt whether the decision was not rested on the ground that there was no sufficient evidence of a contract. The case cited from has no relation to the question before us. It has reference to the inquiry, what is sufficient proof of an agreement between the shipper and the carrier, an inquiry that does not arise in the present case, for the demurrer admits an express agreement.
7
8
Our conclusion, then, founded upon the analogous decisions of courts, as well as upon sound reason, is that the express agreement between the parties averred in the plea was a reasonable one, and hence that it was not against the policy of the law. It purported to relieve the defendants from no part of the obligations of a common carrier. They were bound to the same diligence, fidelity, and care as they would have been required to exercise if no such agreement had been made. All that the stipulation required was that the shipper, in case the package was lost or damaged, should assert his claim in season to enable the defendants to ascertain the facts; in other words, that he should assert it within ninety days. It follows that the Circuit Court erred in sustaining the plaintiff's demurrer to the plea.

DECATUR BANK
v.
ST. LOUIS BANK.
October Term, 1874
1
ERROR to the Circuit Court for the Southern District of Illinois.
1
2
In the autumn and winter of P. E. Frederick—who, according to his own account, was at that time 'engaged in buying and shipping stock in St. Louis'—intending to purchase cattle there and ship them to a business connection of his in Chicago, named J. S. Talmadge, who was to receive and sell them, and honor Frederick's drafts given in payment for the same—applied to the First National Bank of Decatur, Illinois, for a letter of credit on some bank in St. Louis. The bank at Decatur accordingly gave him a letter on its correspondent, the Home Savings Bank of St. Louis.

DEAR SIR: Mr. Frederick has to-day presented your letter of credit for $h at thirty days. Permit me to inquire, in case his drafts for $or less on Talmadge are paid, does your letter mean that we may take his draft again up to same amount, and so on for your limit, thirty days? That is to say, do you guarantee us for thirty days on Frederick's drafts on Talmadge for $?
12
13
Yours respectfully,

H. C. PIERCE, Cashier.
14
15
And on the 21st of September, 1869, the cashier of the Decatur bank replied as follows, viz.:

The thirty days limited in the last letter being on the eve of expiration, the Illinois bank renewed and extended its guarantee by the following communication, viz.:

32
H. C. PIERCE, ESQ., Cashier, St. Louis, Mo.

33
SIR: The letter of credit given you for Mr. Frederick is hereby extended for thirty days from expiration last date.
33
34
Respectfully,
34
35
J. H. LIVINGSTON, Cashier.
35
36
Accredited with the letters thus given, Frederick went to St. Louis, and—having just previously to the 10th of December, 1869 (that is to say, within the term embraced by the letter of November the 22d), shipped hogs to his correspondent at Chicago, Talmadge—drew drafts to the amount of $against them. Talmadge failed before the drafts came due; and the bank at St. Louis now came upon the bank at Decatur for payment under the guarantee. This latter bank set up that its guarantee was of drafts drawn against shipments of cattle, and that the drafts sued on were against shipments of hogs, and that these were not cattle, which term, as understood in the transaction, was confined to animals of the bovine species. The Decatur bank did not allege that any injury had accrued to it by the fact that the shipment was of hogs, which would not have accrued if the shipment had been of animals of the bovine species; or that there was any want of good faith on the part of the St. Louis bank or of Frederick in the transaction.
36
37
'And for a further plea, &c., the defendant says actio non, because, it says, that it is not true that the defendant, by its cashier, executed the alleged letters of credit, or written guarantee, or any of the same in said counts mentioned and described; and this the defendant prays may be inquired of by the country, &c.'
37
38
But this plea was apparently abandoned.
38
39
The court below charged 'that the contract of guarantee was contained in the letter of J. H. Livingston, dated September and the extension thereof, and that the defendant would be bound to pay drafts drawn by Frederick upon Talmadge within the limits of the said letter and the extensions thereof, as to time and amount, no matter whether such drafts were drawn upon shipments of cattle or not.' To this instruction the defendant excepted, and verdict and judgment having been given for the plaintiff the defendant brought the case here. The bill of exceptions set out all the evidence in the case.
39
40
Mr. J. B. Hawley, for the plaintiff in error:
40
41
It is obvious that the court erred in assuming that the letter of September 21st made the credit. That letter plainly refers to the original letter—the letter of the 13th—and explains a doubt which was in the mind of the cashier of the St. Louis bank as to whether, by its terms, the guarantee was a continuing guarantee; but the new letter in no way abandons the old one. Now, that letter shows that the Decatur bank regarded it as important that the drafts to be drawn by Frederick should be drawn upon shipments of cattle. Hogs do not, in the parlance of stockdealers or of banks familiar with the trade of that sort of persons, as both the banks here were, or in fact in any common parlance of anybody, come within the term 'cattle.' It is of no use to cite books of natural history or of lexicography, or even to cite statutes and decisions to show that in certain senses hogs may be included within the term 'cattle.' The question is, what did the parties here before the court mean? And no one familiar with the language of the region where the transactions occurred, or of the country generally, will suppose that when the parties spoke of cattle they meant hogs, any more than that they meant deer.
41
42
The Decatur bank having consented to be bound only in case cattle were shipped, no liability attaches to it if they were not shipped. Talmadge may have had great facilities for dealing in 'cattle,' and none at all in dealing in hogs.
42
43
Again: There is nothing to be found in the National Currency Act, or in any other law, giving authority to National banks to issue letters of credit. They have power to exercise 'all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking; by discounting and negotiating promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange and other evidences of debt; by receiving deposits; by buying and selling exchange, coin, and bullion; by loaning money on personal security; by obtaining, issuing, and circulating notes according to the provisions of this act.'1
43
44
Among these powers the power to issue letters of credit is not found, neither is it incidental to any of the powers granted.
44
45
Mr. F. W. Jones, contra.
45
46
Mr. Justice DAVIS delivered the opinion of the court.
46
47
The basis of this suit is the letter of credit of 13th September, 1869. The subsequent correspondence, on any rational interpretation of it, did not have the effect to change the terms of this the original letter, nor was it intended to do so except in two particulars, which are not the subject of controversy.
47
48
The defence now made, technical though it be, is sufficient to defeat the action if the condition of the guarantee was not observed, and this fact renders necessary a construction of the instrument.
48
49
Like all other contracts it must receive the construction which is most probable and natural under the circumstances, so as to attain the object which the parties to it had in contemplation in making it. Frederick was engaged in buying and shipping stock in St. Louis during the fall and winter of and the presumption is in the absence of any evidence on the point, that he resided in Decatur, where the plaintiff in error had its place of business. At any rate, he was unknown in St. Louis, without either money or credit, and, as he could not carry on his business without money, it was necessary that he should be accredited to some responsible banking house in that city. This was done through the letter of credit of 13th September. The bank to which this letter was addressed doubtless thought its correspondent trusted in some degree to the pecuniary responsibility of Frederick, but it had no right to suppose that the letter of credit was given solely on this account. On the contrary, the letter is based on the idea that shipments of stock would protect the drafts. If Frederick was responsible, still the Decatur bank did not trust to this alone, but relied on the security which was to accompany the drafts. This it had a right to do, and its conduct was very natural under the circumstances. Indeed, the business in which Frederick was engaged is usually conducted in this manner. The Decatur bank doubtless believed, and acted on the belief, that the stock would sell for enough to pay the drafts, and if it did not, the loss would be inconsiderable and such as Frederick could readily meet.
49
50
It now seeks to escape liability, not on the ground that stock sufficient to secure the drafts was not shipped, but that it was a different sort of stock from that named in its letter. It is fair to presume that an investment in hogs yielded as good a return as an investment in cattle, and if the consignee in Chicago had not failed, that no trouble would have arisen. As this consignee, named by it, and with whom the St. Louis bank had no concern, did fail, it seeks to throw the loss on the St. Louis bank because it interpreted the letter to embrace shipments of hogs as well as neat cattle.
50
51
The question then arises, was this interpretation correct?
51
52
That stock of some kind formed part of the guarantee is quite plain, but is the word 'cattle' in this connection to be confined to neat cattle alone, that is, cattle of the bovine genus? It is often so applied, but it is 'also a collective name for domestic quadrupeds generally, including not only the bovine tribe, but horses, asses, mules, sheep, goats, and swine.'2 In its limited sense it is used to designate the different varieties of horned animals, but it is also frequently used with a broader signification as embracing animals in general which serve as food for man. In England, even in a criminal case, where there is a greater strictness of construction than in a civil controversy, pigs were held to be included within the words 'any cattle.'3 And in other cases in that country involving life and liberty the word has been construed so as to embrace animals not used for food.4
52
53
Did the Decatur bank use the word in its narrow and restricted meaning or in its more enlarged and general sense? In other words, did it intend to restrict Frederick to the dealing in horned animals alone, and so confine the defendant in error to drafts based on this kind of stock? There was no apparent motive for doing so. Clearly, security was the object to be attained, and this was better attained by leaving Frederick unrestricted in the choice of animals to send forward to market, provided they were of the kind generally used for food. It is well known that the market varies at the Chicago cattle-yards. At certain times hogs have a readier sale and bring better prices than other kinds of stock, and at other times horned animals alone command the attention of buyers. Every prudent dealer in stock informs himself of the state of the market before purchasing, and the means of doing this are greatly multiplied in later years.
53
54
That Frederick pursued this course, and bought and sold according to the indications of the Chicago market, would seem clear from the evidence, for he says he was engaged in buying and shipping stock in St. Louis during the fall and winter of If his operations, except in the single instance on which the drafts in suit are based, were confined to horned stock, why did he not say so? If true, it would have strengthened the defence, because it would have shown that all the dealings between Frederick and the defendant in error, with a single exception, were based on shipments of stock of the bovine genus. These dealings were continued through a period of three months by the renewals of the guarantee, and could not have been infrequent. It would seem, therefore, that the parties in St. Louis dealt with each other on the understanding that the guarantee embraced the different kinds of stock which are used for food, and usually sent for that purpose to the Chicago market.
54
55
They had the right to give this construction to it, and there is nothing in the evidence tending to show that the plaintiff in error understood it differently, except that the word 'cattle,' as often used, does not include hogs. But it would be a narrow rule to hold that this word was used in its restricted sense, in the absence of any evidence, other than inferential, on the subject. Especially is this so when the word is susceptible of a different meaning, and important transactions have been based on the idea that it was employed in its enlarged and not in its restricted sense.
55
56
This construction of the letter of credit disposes of the case and affirms the judgment.
56
57
It is true, the judge of the Circuit Court instructed the jury that the letter of September 21st, which leaves out the terms 'on shipments of cattle,' constituted the contract of guarantee between the plaintiff and defendant, but the result would have been the same if he had charged the jury, as we are of the opinion that he should have done, that the rights of the parties were to be determined by the terms of the original letter of credit of the 13th September.
57
58
In either aspect of the case the judgment must have been for the plaintiff below, and to warrant the reversal of a judgment there must be not only error found in the record, but the error must be such as may have worked injury to the party complaining.5
58
59
The bill of exceptions contains all the evidence in the case, and though the jury may have found their verdict on a wrong theory of the case, yet as the court can see that the verdict was correct, the plaintiff in error is not harmed by the misdirection of the judge. The result is right, although the manner of reaching it may have been wrong.
59
60
It was urged at the bar that National banks are not authorized to issue letters of credit, and if so, that the action cannot be sustained. But the record does not raise the question, and it cannot, therefore, be considered. It is true a plea was interposed which was doubtless meant to raise it, on which, issue to the country was tendered, but for aught that appears it was abandoned.
60
61
No evidence was offered under it, but if this were not necessary the attention of the court at least should have been called to it, and proper instructions asked. If refused, error could have been assigned, and the point would then have been properly before the court for decision.
61
62
Nothing of the kind was done, and it is too late to raise the question now.
62
63
JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

89 U.S. 136
ST. JOHN
v.
ERIE RAILWAY COMPANY.
October Term, 1874
1
'The association is required to deposit . . stocks of the State of New York.'
1
2
'Now when the capital of the bank is required to be invested in stocks, and among others in United States stock.'
2
3
The court is here speaking of State debts and United States debts.
3
4
The statutes of the United States equally use the terms debt and stock as convertible. One of them,3 ex. gr., relating to a 3 per cent. loan, says:
4
5
'Any part of the principal of the said debt or stock, bearing an interest of 3 per cent., as shall be unredeemed, shall,' &c.
5
6
Then the use of the word 'stock' is nothing, and the only question is, does the contract, as expressed, mean what we assert that it does mean?
6
7
In settling that meaning it is to be noted that these preferred stockholders never sustained the ordinary relations of stockholders, general or preferred. They began as creditors. They never subscribed for stock, nor paid instalments, nor took part in creating a corporation, nor had an opportunity to share in unlimited profits, nor agreed to assume any of the ordinary risk of stockholders, nor bargained for so large a vote as to be able to protect themselves, but from the beginning relied on a peculiar contract relation, due notice of which they caused to be conspicuously published to all the world. They are in part creditors and in part stockholders, and not technically either. They have the rights which their contract gives them, and a name will not make those rights greater or less. Modern business and legislation have created relations which, according to the narrow views of the old laws and decisions, would be anomalous, and in them a person may be in some sense and at the same time a creditor and a stockholder. Such is the case of every preferred stockholder.
7
8
There is no use of considering what would be our condition in case of insolvency, and who would be then preferred. What has that condition to do with our rights during solvency? We will consider the case of insolvency when it arises.
8
9
It is matter of common knowledge that the Erie Railway has been largely built by English capital. The agreement whose meaning is now under consideration was doubtless made in all its parts by representatives of English capitalists. The expressions of English statutes, the views of English writers, and the decisions of the English courts may be looked to with more than common deference in interpreting it. Now, in the English law, preferred stock is commonly called debenture stock, the word debenture coming obviously from debere, to owe. So the dividends on preferred or debenture stock are commonly called interest; and the English law declares them to 'rank next to interest payable on the mortgages or bonds for the time being,'4 though it admits of course that the holders of it cannot require repayment of what they have paid for it.
9
10
Nor is there anything in the use of the word 'dividend' which of itself impairs our argument. If it was said, in terms, that the 'dividend' on preferred stock was to be paid out of net earnings from existing roads, and next after mortgage-interest, and prior to rent on any new leases, and prior to interest on any new loans, the meaning and the case would be clear. The word 'dividend' then is unimportant. And the only question is whether, in any way, the meaning and the case are clear? This so-called dividend, it will be noted, is to be declared from 'net earnings,' and is payable absolutely, each year, if earned, immediately after the mortgage-interest is paid. The payment may be called a dividend, but it is more analogous to interest.
10
11
If every common stockholder should be present and vote to have any such surplus of net profits used for some other designated purpose, this would confessedly not impair the claims of preferred stockholders to receive it.
11
12
In the case of Maryland v. Railroad Company, very lately decided by this court,5 the State of Maryland was, by a contract with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, entitled to have and receive a perpetual dividend of six per cent. per annum (upon $which the State lent to the company), out of the profits of the road. Does any one doubt that this made a debt from the company to the State in case any profits were made? And that calling the money to be paid a dividend was nothing?
12
13
Nor is there anything in the expression 'net earnings' which impairs our argument. Of course 'net earnings' are gross earnings after the deduction of every sort of cost, charge, and expense of administering and working 'the road.' But what road? That is the question to be settled. The language is 'the net earnings of the said road.' Does 'the said road' mean the road then known as the road of the Erie Railway Company—the road, and the only road, which had been before the contracting parties—with its then leased roads,—or does it mean that road—that 'said road'—with a score of different, distant, and most unprofitable roads, worked into its corpus as a part of it, and with $of debt created to equip and use them? That, we say, is the question.
13
14
The case made by the pleadings is a little obscure as to what road or roads absorbed the $borrowed. But that vast sum is not shown to have been expended on the line as it existed when the preferred stock was created. That line must have been completed and equipped, and it could never have been expected that such sums would be borrowed to use on such a road. Without doubt the money was expended in great measure on the newly leased lines.
14
15
II. Now, the defendant should have kept separate accounts of its newly leased roads, and been prepared to sustain their losses or demonstrate their profits. The plaintiff is entitled to have counted as gross earnings on the line as it existed when his stock was created, all the money thereon received and earned, and from this can be deducted only the expenses of operating such line, including, of course, rents payable for any portion of it. Such accounts are easily kept. On that basis the plaintiff will take his chances of a dividend, as the contract provides, and will regard his prospects as greatly improved. The company denies that right, and refuses such account and payment. This rule of separate accounts is the English rule. In Corry v. Londonderry,6 where there were five classes of stockholders, the court held that the company must keep separate accounts, and that the discretion of the directors over expenditures was limited by the rights conferred on preferred shareholders. Where net profits were pledged, as here, it was held they could not be diminished by subtracting from them 'money raised under the borrowing powers,' and that 'money procured for the purpose of completing the line cannot be paid out of profits.'
15
16
A material part of the reasoning of this case has been sustained by Taft v. The Hartford Railroad,7 in this country.
16
17
III. It will be said, doubtless, by opposing counsel, that our view of the law would obstruct all expansion of the company's business, by preventing the company borrowing money or leasing roads. If such was the effect, the fact would be no reason for the court refusing us our right. Such a contract made by the company, and sanctioned by the courts and the legislature, as this has been, would be valid, however inconvenient it might be. But such is not the effect. The company may lease, and borrow, and expand, and the preferred stock no more obstructs them than does a mortgage. They must first give us a dividend, if there be net earnings to pay it, just as they must pay mortgage-interest.
17
18
Mr. W. W. McFarland, contra, for the company.
18
19
Mr. Justice SWAYNE delivered the opinion of the court.
19
20
The question presented in the present case depends for its solution wholly upon the construction given to the fifth clause of the agreement of and the fourth section of the act of They are identical in effect as regards the point to be considered.
20
21
The original takers of the preferred stock were creditors. They abandoned that position and became stockholders. They thereupon ceased to be the former, and can only be regarded as the latter. They surrendered their debts and received in return stock of the same amount, which gave them a chance for annual dividends of seven per cent., and a voice by voting in the choice of those by whom the affairs of the company were to be administered. What they were to receive was not interest, but dividends; and they were to receive them in priority to the holders of the common stock. The latter could receive nothing until the former were satisfied. The maximum payable on the preferred stock was specified. It might be less, or nothing. It could not be more. The amount subject to the limit prescribed depended wholly upon the residue of the net earnings applicable in that way. The language employed is apt to express the relation of stockholders. None to express the relation of creditors is found in the instrument; and there is nothing from which the intent to continue that relation any longer can be inferred. If the mortgages were foreclosed and there were a surplus left insufficient to satisfy the general creditors, it is quite clear that the holders of the preferred stock could have no right to share in the fund.
21
22
The dividends were to be paid after the mortgage-interest and delayed coupons were paid in full.
22
23
This clause was inserted doubtless out of abundant caution, to prevent the possibility of a claim being set up to the prejudice of the holders of the mortgage securities. Whether the restriction was necessary, for that purpose, we need not consider. The preferred dividends were to be paid out of 'the net earnings of the road.' The lexical definition of net is 'clear of all charges and deductions.'—Webster. 'That which remains after the deduction of all charges or outlay, as net profit.'—Worcester. The popular acceptation of the term is the same. There is no controversy between the parties on this subject. Such net earnings must have been earned in 'the current year.' There are these four specific limitations. There are no others. It is not said that the preferred dividends shall be paid next after the mortgage interest and delayed coupons, nor after, nor pro rata with anything else, nor before anything else except dividends upon the common stock. Beyond the four restrictions named, the matter is left to be regulated wholly by the principles of law and the discretion of the company. Suppose in this case the holders of coupons of the sterling bonds and the holders of preferred stock claimed payment at the same time and the fund was insufficient to meet both demands, can it be doubted that the rights of the creditor would be held paramount to those of the shareholder, and that the interest must be fully satisfied before a dividend could be paid? The plainest principles of reason and justice as well as the law would require this result. A question is raised as to the source to which the phrase 'net earnings of the road' refers. The term road is used as an appellative, and was clearly intended to include the principal road and all its adjuncts. The complainant insists that the 'net earnings' must be the net earnings of things as they were when the preferred stock was issued. We find nothing in the case, express or implied, to warrant this view. At the time referred to, the company held certain leases. If it was deemed best, and was found practicable, could not the company have rid itself of them? If the complainant's view be correct, this could not be done, at any rate not without the consent of the preferred stockholders. So if the company deemed it proper to take leases of other roads, in addition to those previously held, or in place of them, what was there to prevent it? Upon what ground can it be claimed that the category 'net earnings of the road' was not intended to embrace the net earnings of all the business of the company for the time being, whether done upon one or many roads?
23
24
There is nothing in the agreement or the statute, and we are aware of no legal principle which would authorize the stockholders in question to analyze the business, select out a part of it, and to say that the net earnings specified must be a predicate of that part, and of none other. The company had the right to conduct its operations, in good faith, as it might see fit; and it was from them and all of them that the materials for the computations of earnings were to be derived.
24
25
The only qualification prescribed in this connection is not as to the scope, means, or elements of the business, but is one in point of time. The net earnings from which the preferred dividends were to be paid must have been earned 'in the current year.' Whether the business of such year were large or small, or of what it consisted, is immaterial. The corporation never agreed to be limited in the exercise of its faculties and franchises, and the complainant must abide the result. If errors wee committed, and a loss ensued, a court of equity cannot relieve him. It is one of the chances of the enterprise in which he embarked.
25
26
The business of the road was a unit. If it had been diaintegrated as proposed by the complainant, we apprehend it would have been found that the correlations of the main stem and the branches were such, and that the expenses and charges incident to the entire business and those of the several parts were so interwoven and blended, that an accurate ascertainment of the net profit of the main line and any of the auxiliaries, taken separately from the rest, would have been impracticable. An ancillary road may be short and yield but little income, yet by reason of its reaching to coalfields, or from other local causes, its contributions to other roads of the series may be very large and profitable. Whether in this case the partial computation insisted upon could or could not have been made, the process was one upon which the company was neither bound nor had the right to enter.
26
27
We hold that the computation by the company for the year was made upon the proper basis, and that the complainant is concluded by it. We are of the opinion that the rents for that year, accruing under leases taken by the company after the issuing of the preferred stock, and the interest upon the sterling bonds for that year were properly paid, and that there were no net earnings earned in that year which could be properly applied in payment of preferred dividends. These views are fatal to the complainant's case. We have carefully examined all the authorities referred to by his learned counsel. None of them are in hostility to the conclusions at which we have arrived.

89 U.S. 464
HUNNEWELL
v.
CASS COUNTY.
October Term, 1874
1
APPEAL from the Circuit Court for the District of Nebraska.
1
2
Hunnewell, for himself and others, citizens, all, of States other than Nebraska, filed a bill in the court below against Cass and other counties of the State of Nebraska, their treasurers, and the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad Company, to obtain an injunction on the said treasurers, to prevent their collecting State and county taxes which had been levied on certain lands granted to the said company by an act of Congress. He alleged himself and the others to be stockholders in the company; that the lands on which the taxes had been assessed were not liable to taxation under State authority; that the company was about to pay these taxes notwithstanding that he had made a protest and remonstrance against their so doing. The bill prayed relief as above said by injunction.
2
3
The case, divested of parts of it disposed of in principle by the case of Railroad Company v. McShane, just reported, and therefore not necessary to be presented, was thus:1
3
4
An act of Congress, approved July by which the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad Company, a corporation created by the laws of Iowa, was authorized to extend its road through Nebraska, from a point on the Missouri River to another point on the Pacific railroad, so as to connect with it, thus enacted:
4
5
'SECTION 19. That for the purpose of aiding in the construction of said road, there be and hereby is granted to the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad Company, every alternate section of public land. . designated by odd numbers, to the amount of ten alternate sections per mile on each side of the said road, on the line thereof, and not sold, reserved, or otherwise disposed of by the United States, and to which a pre-emption or homestead claim may not have attached at the time the line of said road is definitely fixed.'
5
6
By a subsequent section, whenever the company had completed twenty consecutive miles of its road, in a manner prescribed, the President of the United States was to appoint commissioners to examine and report to him relative thereto; and if it should appear to him that twenty miles of the road had been properly completed, then, upon certificate of said commissioners to that effect, patents were to issue conveying the right and title to the lands to the company on each side of said road as far as the same was completed. And such examination, report, and conveyance by patents, was to continue from time to time, in like manner, until the road should be completed.
6
7
The act went on in its twenty-first section thus:
7
8
'SECTION 21. Before any land granted by this act shall be conveyed to the said company . . there shall first be paid into the Treasury of the United States the cost of surveying, selecting, and conveying the same by the said company. . which amount shall, without further appropriation, stand to the credit of the proper account, to be used by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, for the prosecution of the survey of public lands along the line of said road.'
8
9
The road of the Burlington and Missouri company was completed for the purpose of this case, we may consider, in the spring of In that year, the first day of April fell on Monday.
9
10
The costs of surveying the lands which the county treasurers had sought to tax, were paid on the seventh day of March; and the fees of the register and receiver of the land office—which fees the complainants alleged to be the 'cost' of 'selecting and conveying,' which, with the cost of surveying, the above-quoted twenty-first section enacted should be paid into the treasury, 'before any land granted by the act should be conveyed to the company,'—were not paid until the 19th and 20th of April, which days, as happened in 1872, were respectively the third Friday and Saturday of the month; the third Monday (as the month came in on Monday) having been the 15th.
10
11
The complainants now, citing a statute of Nebraska, which they stated governed the subject, alleged that the time to which all assessment, for taxation of lands in the State related, was fixed by the statute on the first day of March, in each year; and that if the lands were not taxable on that day, they were not taxable at all for that year; that if this were not true, yet that no land could be taxed for any year which was not liable to taxation when the power of certain 'precinct assessors,' mentioned in the statute, expired after their meeting on the first Monday of April (prescribed by the statute), for the purpose of equalizing the assessment, or, at the latest, after the session of the county commissioners which the statute fixed for the third Monday of April, and which third Monday in April, 1872, was, as already stated, Monday the fifteenth of the month.
11
12
The facts of the case and the positions just stated involved, therefore, two questions:
12
 Whether under the statutes of Nebraska the assessment, &c., had been in time?2. Whether the fees of the register and receiver, which had been paid on the third Friday and Saturday (the 19th and 20th) of April, were the 'costs' of 'selecting and conveying the lands' which the twenty-first section of the act of Congress enacted should, with the cost of surveying, be paid before the lands should be conveyed to the company?
13
14
As to the first point, the only statute of Nebraska referred to by counsel on either side, or which was suggested from any quarter as bearing on the question, was one, as follows:
14
15
'GENERAL STATUTE .
15
16
'SECTION 26. The precinct assessors of each county shall meet at the office of the county clerk, on the first Monday of April of each year, for the purpose of equalizing the assessments, and shall return their lists to the county clerk on or before the second Monday of the same month.
16
17
'SECTION 27. The county commissioners of each county shall constitute a board of equalization for the county, and said board, or any two of them, shall hold a session of at least three days, at the county seat, commencing on the third Monday of April in each year, for the purpose of equalizing and correcting the assessment roll in their county.'
17
18
By section twenty-eight the county clerk is directed to make out and transmit to the State auditor an abstract of these matters, as settled by the board of county commissioners, on or before the first Monday of May. On the fourth Monday in May the governor, State auditor, and treasurer are to meet as a State board of equalization, and to decide upon the rate of the State tax, State school tax, and sinking fund tax for the current year.
18
19
The auditor is then to transmit this result to the county clerks on or before the second Monday in June, and on the first Monday in July the county commissioners are required to meet and levy the necessary taxes for the current year.
19
20
By section fifty-two it is declared that taxes upon real property shall be a perpetual lien thereupon, commencing from the 1st day of March of the current year, against all persons and bodies corporate, except the United States and the State of Nebraska.
20
21
By section fifteen all personal property is to be listed, assessed, and taxed in the county where the owner resides on the 1st day of March, but if the owner resides out of the State it is to be listed and taxed where it may be at the time of listing.
21
22
As to the second matter, whether the fees of the registers and receivers were or were not 'costs of selecting and conveying the lands,' within the meaning of the twenty-first section, the act of Congress, the only statute cited on either side, was one of July as follows:3
22
23
'An Act to regulate the compensation of registers and receivers of the land offices in the several States and Territories, in the location of lands by States and corporations under grants from Congress.
23
24
'In the location of lands by States and corporations, under grants from Congress for railroads and other purposes. . the registers and receivers of the land offices of the several States and Territories in the districts where such lands may be located, for their services therein shall be entitled to receive a fee of $1 for each final location of one hundred and sixty acres, to be paid by the State or corporation making such location, the same to be accounted for in the same manner as fees and commissions on warrants and pre-emption locations, with limitations as to maximum of salary prescribed by existing laws, in accordance with such instructions as shall be given by the Commissioner of the General Land Office.'
24
25
The court below dismissed the bill. It said in its opinion:
25
26
'The fees to the registers and receivers of the local land offices, under the act of July are not embraced within those required to be paid by the twenty-first section of the act of These are fees for 'location,' not for 'selecting' and 'conveying' the land.
26
27
'But again, it may be remarked that the cost of surveying was paid in time to make the lands taxable; the work of selecting the lands was done by the company without, so far as shown, any expense to the government, and for the cost of conveying it does not appear that the government makes or has any claim.'
27
28
From the decree of dismissal the complainants took this appeal.
28
29
I. In Railway Company v. Prescott,4 this court held, that until the payment by the company of costs of 'surveying, selecting, and conveying' the lands, they were not liable to taxation. Though another point in that case has been questioned as not perhaps perfectly well considered,5 this point has been received by all as well founded.
29
30
Now, we say that, in this case, those costs have not been paid.
30
 Our position is that the fees of the register and receiver were the 'costs of selecting and conveying' the lands mentioned in the twenty-first section of the act of Congress, because:
31
32
a. The statutes nowhere provide for the payment of any other expenses connected with the selection and conveyance of lands granted to railroads.
32
33
b. The surplus, after paying those officers the maximum allowed them, is turned into the General Land Office, to defray the expenses of further surveys.
33
34
c. While the term used in one act is 'location,' and in another 'selection,' each when applied to railroad grants means the same thing. The act making a grant to a railroad company, as in that to this company, always locates the grant and selects or designates the lands; but by reason of conflict with pre-emption and homestead rights, and other grants, a process, more or less complicated, is gone through with, which is properly described by either term.
34
 The costs of patenting the lands were certainly 'costs of conveying' them, none of which, of course, were paid until after the other costs.
35
 The revenue law of Nebraska fixes no day at which the fiscal year begins, nor does it, in terms, fix a day at which the owner of real estate becomes taxable in respect thereof. But section fifty-two of the General Statute designating the 1st of March at which taxes become a lien, does impliedly fix that as the day at which the owner is liable for taxes thereon. If on that day lands are not taxable, they are not so at all for that year. Now, on the 1st of March, 1872, this company was not taxable in respect of these lands.
36
 But if this be not so, certainly the process of assessment having been concluded on the first Monday in April (which in 1872 was the first of the month), after which day the lands were selected, and all the costs of selection and conveyance paid, these lands were not taxable to this company for that year.
37
38
a. The assessment of property is the essential prerequisite to a valid levy of taxes thereon.6
38
39
b. The rule is general and imperative, that assessments can be made only when and as the statute prescribes.7
39
40
c. And the assessment must be made within the time limited therefor.8
40
41
d. Property not taxable at the day the assessment closes, is not taxable at all.9
41
42
II. In Railway Company v. Prescott, this court says:
42
43
'While we recognize the doctrine heretofore laid down, that lands sold by the United States may be taxed before they have parted with the legal title, by issuing a patent, it is to be understood as applicable to cases where the right to the patent is complete, and the equitable title is fully vested in the party without anything more to be paid, or any act to be done, going to the foundation of his right.'
43
44
Even if we are wrong in insisting that the register's and receiver's fees were to cover the costs of selecting the lands, yet until the 19th day of April, 1872, this company had not a complete right to a patent, nor was the equitable title fully vested in it, because:
44
 The twenty-first section of the act of Congress required the payment of these fees before the lands could be located, and the first step in that behalf was the certificate from the local to the General Land Office; so that more did remain to be paid until that day.
45
 At that day, too, 'an act remained to be done, going to the foundation of the right' to the patent, namely, the location of the lands, which act was begun when the local land officers certified the lists made by the company's agent, and was concluded either when the lists were made by the commissioner or approved by the secretary.
46
47
The process of locating railroad grants is traceable in the recitals in the lists and patents, and is as follows:
47
48
(1.) The company makes its selections, which appear on its original lists filed in the local office.
48
49
(2.) These lists being corrected, are certified by the local to the General Land Office.
49
50
(3.) These lists are approved successively by the commissioner and secretary, after proper examinations and corrections made by them.
50
51
And it is not until all this process is concluded that the right becomes fixed, for not until then is any one quarter section definitively ascertained to be the company's. Here, while no list was certified by the local officers before April 19th, several, we may state as a matter of fact, were not certified until long afterwards; some, indeed, not until after the levy of the taxes in July.
51
52
It is argued on the other side, that because the costs of surveying (paid March , and the register's and receiver's fees (paid April 19th and 20th following) were not paid a few days earlier, the lands were not taxable.
52
53
The State law does not in terms fix the time in which property shall be assessed. The assessment roll is to be returned to the county clerk 'on or before the second Monday of April.'
53
54
The board of equalization 'shall hold a session of at least three days, commencing on the third Monday of April.' After the assessment is equalized and corrected, and before the first Monday of May, the clerk shall make an abstract thereof.
54
55
Taxes are to be levied on the first Monday of July.
55
56
The position of the other side is that the power of the assessor was exhausted on the 8th of April, and of the board on the 17th of April. According to that theory, the register's and receiver's fees were paid two days or twelve days too late for taxation purposes. If the county officers had control of this matter of assessment as late as April 21st, then these lands were taxable even upon the theory set up.
56
57
It is not necessary, however, to base the right to tax these lands upon any calculations in or out of the three, or the eleven days. The case may well rest upon grounds less technical.
57
 We assert that the lands were taxable, say on the 1st April, notwithstanding these fees were not yet paid.
58
59
The twenty-first section of the act of Congress provides that before the lands shall be conveyed, 'the costs of surveying, selecting, and conveying' them shall be paid, 'which amount shall . . stand to the credit of the proper account, to be used by the Commissioner of the General Land Office for the prosecution of the surveys of the public lands along the line of the road.'
59
60
Thus all the money paid stands appropriated at the moment of payment to the single purpose of prosecuting surveys along the line of the road.
60
61
If there were no unsurveyed lands along the line of the road, what becomes of the money? All these lands were surveyed prior to The money, therefore, could not be used for the purpose of prosecuting surveys along the line of the road. The intention of Congress was to make the companies pay for surveying the lands they were to receive; not to reimburse the government for money already expended on surveys.
61
62
It would seem that the section could have no application to this grant. In Railway Company v. Prescott it did not appear that the lands along the line of the road had been surveyed, but the fact was otherwise as respects the Kansas Pacific, as well as the Union Pacific; at least as to the more westerly portions of the lines.
62
63
So, we may assert, that the section took effect as to the lands of these two companies, but not as to this grant.
63
64
But do the words 'selecting and conveying' mean acts of the register and receiver for which they are to receive fees? As to the selecting, it appears that this was done by the company; and, as said by the circuit judge, 'without, so far as shown, any expense to the government.'
64
65
In Railway Company v. Prescott the stress was laid upon the non-payment of the costs of surveying. Nothing is said about the fees of the register and receiver.
65
66
In the case of grants, to which the section applies, the reasons for requiring the payment of the costs of surveying are cogent. It may be said that the lands are not fully earned until this is done, though the road be completed and accepted. The lands must, indeed, be surveyed before the grant can attach to them. No one knows which the odd-numbered sections are until they are surveyed. This may be said to be one of the things mentioned in Railway Company v. Prescott as to be done, because going to the 'foundation' of the right to the lands.

But after this payment it would seem that the equitable title was complete, and that what follows relates only to the evidences of the legal title; such as payment of register's and receiver's fees, issuing and recording the patent, & c.
67
68
If these views are correct, it follows that the case does not fall within the principles laid down in the case just cited, and that the twenty-first section of the act of Congress does not contain anything to defeat the right of the State to tax these lands. Indeed, the provisions of these sections were intended to be a burden upon the grants; but if the construction contended for on the other side be correct, they give the companies the most valuable franchise they can possess, immunity from taxation.
68
69
This immunity, it is to be observed, does not exist by reason of any statutory law, but if it exists at all it is by virtue of judicial construction. But the rule is firmly established that a statute granting exemptions from taxation shall receive the narrowest construction, when the statute is in the least degree ambiguous. Here, in the absence of any statute, the court is asked to declare the exemption as a matter of inference. In Christ Church Hospital v. The County of Philadelphia,10 in speaking of a tax-exemption statute this court says:
69
70
'It belongs to a class of statutes in which the narrowest meaning is to be taken which will fairly carry out the intent of the legislature.'
70
71
There is no implication in government grants.11

72
Mr. Justice MILLER delivered the opinion of the court.
72
73
The ground of exemption claimed by the bill in this case, so far as not disposed of by the case of Railroad Company v. McShane, just decided, rests upon the allegation that the costs of selecting, surveying, and conveying the lands had not been paid at the time of their assessment for taxes of the year these being the taxes in dispute. In regard to this ground, we find ourselves embarrassed by two very troublesome questions, if their solution is essential to a decision of the case, as was assumed in the argument.
73
 What is the latest period at which, by the laws of Nebraska, the right to assess lands for taxation can be exercised for any given year?
74
 What are the costs of selecting and conveying the lands of these railroad companies, mentioned in the third section of the act of ?
75
76
As the latter question is one to be solved by the acts of Congress or by the rules and regulations of the lands department, it would seem an appropriate one for a Federal court to answer.
76
77
But the lands granted to railroads generally by acts of Congress are the alternate sections on each side of the road within a certain limit, and, therefore, when the surveys are made and the line of the road laid down by protraction through these surveys, the sections and parts of sections are at once determined; and there is no choice or selection to be made.
77
78
It is true that by some statutes, and especially by the one granting the lands in question, where it is found that any odd section which would otherwise go to the company has been disposed of or pre-empted, the company may take other lands in place of it, and this it may select within certain distances from the road. But the selection, in such case is made by the company, and it is difficult to imagine what costs the government incurs in the selection which is to be paid by the company 'into the Treasury of the United States.' These lands thus selected in lieu of others also are such small part of the whole grant that the costs of selection could not amount to much, and the record in the case does not enable us to determine what particular parcels are of this character.
78
79
The act of July enacts that the register and receiver of the land office in which the lands granted to States and corporations for railroad and other purposes are located, are entitled to receive from such corporations a fee of one dollar for each final location of one hundred and sixty acres, to be accounted for as other fees are, with limitations of maximum salary prescribed by law.
79
80
Counsel for the appellant insists that these are the costs of selection referred to in the twenty-first section of the act of Congress of But those costs were to be paid into the treasury, and these are to be paid to the registers and receivers. Unless these officers receive fees beyond the maximum salary allowed to them, these fees would not go into the treasury, and certainly are not paid into it by the company, as that act requires the costs to be paid to which it refers.
80
81
Again, these fees are to be paid on all the lands located, which may fairly be construed to be all the lands ascertained to belong to the company under a grant, while the costs spoken of in the twenty-first section are the costs of selection, which can properly apply only to lands where a choice or option employing exercise of judgment has been used. Still, as these are the only costs or expenses which counsel on either side has been able to suggest as the costs of selecting the lands within the meaning of the statute, it is unsafe to say they are not the costs referred to.
81
82
There is equal uncertainty about what is meant by the costs of conveying the lands by the government. The conveyance is by patent, and we have been shown no statute which authorizes a charge or fee for issuing the patent, nor was counsel on either side able to refer us to any such, though both were familiar with the operations of the land department in the West.
82
83
Turning from this difficulty to the question of the time to which the taxability of property, real or personal, relates under the laws of Nebraska, we find an equal embarrassment. No decision of any court of that State has been made on the subject. No language of the revenue laws of the State fixes such a time expressly.
83
84
The provisions contained in General Act are all the provisions we have been able to find bearing on the question, and they are far from conclusive. In regard to personal property, the first of March seems to be adopted as a criterion to determine who shall pay the tax, and what county shall receive it when it has changed locality or ownership during the year and before the tax is levied. This may also be the reason of fixing the lien of the tax on land on the same day, that vendor and vendee may have a rule to determine upon whom the burden shall fall. But from this time until the State board of equalization on the fourth Monday in May acts finally upon it, the assessment of property both real and personal is in progress and is incomplete, and the final levy of the tax does not take place until July. In the absence of any day or time fixed decisively by the statute or clearly deducible from it, and of any decision of any court of the State on the subject, or of any long and well-settled practice by the State authorities, we hesitate to say that when land is only exempt from taxation by reason of the claims upon it of the Federal government, and those claims are satisfied before the final proceedings are concluded, it would not be included in that assessment. In such case not half the current year for which the taxes are levied has expired. The general matter of assessment or valuation for taxation is still within the control of the proper officers, and if it is brought to their knowledge that the full ownership of the lands has passed from the United States to individuals or corporations it would seem equitable that they should bear their share of the burden of taxation.
84
85
We are the more inclined not to interfere in this case by the extraordinary remedy of injunction, because it is shown that as to all these lands, not only had all dues to the United States been paid before the final action of the State board of equalization, but patents had issued for all of them before this suit was brought. At the time, therefore, of filing this bill to prevent the collection of taxes on account of the interest of the United States in the lands on which they were levied, the United States had no interest in the land which would forbid their being taxed; nor is it clear that they had any when the lands were assessed. The costs of surveying were paid before even the precinct assessors assessed these lands, as they then thought they had a right to do, and it is extremely uncertain whether any costs of selecting or conveying the lands within the meaning of the act of Congress existed or were unpaid.
85
86
Under all the circumstances, without deciding that there is any particular day to which by the laws of Nebraska the liability for taxation of real estate must always be referred, or if there be, what that day is, we affirm the decree of the Circuit Court dismissing the bill in this case.
86
87
DECREE AFFIRMED.

In this case, as in Railroad Co. v. McShane, referred to in the text, the objection was taken that the lands were or might become, within three years from the completion of the road (A. D. , subject to the pre-emption clause of the 3d section of the original act of the railroad company assuming that the grant to it, because it was found in the act of (which act was confessedly 'amendatory' of the act of , was governed by that clause. The court below, however, held that proposition to be one not sound. After the decision in Railroad Co. v. McShane, the question whether it was or not became, of course, of no importance, since if it were so governed, the fact would, under the decision there made, be no ground of exemption.
