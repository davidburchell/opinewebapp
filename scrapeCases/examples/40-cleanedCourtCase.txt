300 U.S. 82
ICKES, Secretary of the Interior,
v.
FOX et al.* SAME v. PARKS et al. SAME v. OTTMULLER.
Argued Jan. 6, 1937.
1
The sole question in each of these three cases is whether the United States is an indispensable party defendant. The suits were brought in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. That court, on motion of petitioner, deeming the presence of the United States to be indispensable, dismissed the bills as amended. Thereupon, by permission of the court, second-amended bills were filed. Petitioner renewed his motions to dismiss, which the court then denied. A special appeal was allowed by the court below, and resulted in an affirmance of the decree of the trial court. The allegations of the three second-amended bills of complaint differ in some particulars; but whether these differences will affect the extent or measure of the rights of the respective respondents or the final disposition of the suits so as to require unlike decrees, we do not determine. They are not such as to necessitate diverse rulings in respect of the question which now is presented for decision. In this view, we confine our statement, except as otherwise noted, to the allegations of the bill of complaint in the Fox Case, No. 
1
2
Petitioner, as Secretary of the Interior, has charge of the administration of the Reclamation Act of June , as amended. In 1906, the then Secretary of the Interior approved a reclamation project known as the 'Sunnyside Unit of the Yakima Project'; and purchased from the Washington Irrigation Company the Sunnyside Canal, together with the water appropriations and irrigation system connected therewith. At the time of the purchase, certain arid and unirrigated lands described in the bill, thereafter and now owned by respondents, were within the unit embraced by the project.
2
3
The then owners of the lands, predecessors of respondents in title, and other owners of similar lands, incorporated the Sunnyside Water Users Association under the lands within the reclamation project, and lands within the reclamation project, and agreed to take water from the project to irrigate such lands.
3
4
The association, on May 7, 1906, entered into a contract with the United States, the recitals of which in substance, so far as pertinent, are that these lands are desert and arid in character and will remain so unless the waters of the Yakima river and its tributaries be impounded and the flow regulated and controlled; that the Secretary contemplates the construction of irrigation works under the Reclamation Act for the irrigation and reclamation of these lands; that the incorporators and shareholders of the association are required to be owners and occupants of lands within the area to be irrigated, and already are in some cases appropriators of water for the irrigation thereof; that they are required to initiate rights to the use of water from the proposed irrigation works as soon as may be, and complete the acquisition thereof as prescribed by the Secretary, 'which rights shall be, and thereafter continue to be, forever appurtenant to designated lands owned by such shareholders.'
4
5
Following these recitals, it was agreed that only those who became members of the association should be accepted as applicants for rights to the use of water; that the aggregate amount of such rights should not exceed the number of acres of land capable of irrigation by the total quantity of water available—namely, the quantity now appropriated by shareholders of the association and the quantity to be delivered from all sources in excess of the water now appropriated; that the Secretary should determine the number of acres capable of such irrigation, 'to be based upon and measured and limited by the beneficial use of water'; that water rights should be paid for in ten annual installments; that the association guarantees payment for that part of the cost of the irrigation works apportioned to its shareholders—times and methods of payment being stipulated in detail; that rights to water where the same have vested were to be defined, determined, and enjoyed in accordance with the Reclamation Act and other acts of Congress on the subject of the acquisition and enjoyment of such rights, and by the laws of the state of Washington.
5
6
Some time after the execution of the foregoing contract, the predecessors in title of respondents, upon officially-approved forms, made applications for water rights for the irrigation of the lands here involved. By the terms of the applications, the measure of the water right for the land was stated to be that quantity which shall be beneficially used for the irrigation thereof, not exceeding the share proportionate to irrigable acreage of the water supply actually available, to be paid for (in ten annual installments) in an amount which was fixed in each application.1 The applicants agreed that the construction charge and the annual charges for operation and maintenance should be and were made a lien upon the lands and all water rights then or thereafter appurtenant or belonging thereto, together with all improvements thereon.
6
7
It further is alleged that a former Secretary of the Interior determined that the total cost of the water rights for all the lands in the unit would be $52 per acre, and that such sum would be sufficient to return to the reclamation fund the total cost of the project; that, pursuant to the terms of the Reclamation Act, he fixed the construction charge for the land here involved at that amount per acre, and issued public notice and order accordingly; that thereafter the successive Secretaries of the Interior uniformly construed the Reclamation Act and the contractual obligations, to the effect that the owners of the lands had purchased a sufficient quantity of water to beneficially and successfully irrigate their lands, to be determined by representatives of the Secretary having physical charge of the water distribution, from a factual investigation and personal examination of the lands and the crops growing thereon and the water requirements thereof.
7
8
Pursuant thereto, it was determined by representatives of the successive Secretaries that acre feet of water per annum per acre was necessary to beneficially and successfully irrigate respondents' lands; that, thereupon, the Secretaries of the Interior, through their representatives, have, for a period of more than twenty years, delivered to such lands the necessary quantity of water; that after the construction of the irrigation system and reservoirs of sufficient capacity to beneficially and successfully irrigate all lands within the unit, an act of Congress was passed providing that no increase of construction charges could be made after they had been fixed by public notice and order, except by agreement between the secretary and a majority of the water-right applicants (Act Aug. C.A. § . On September 24, 1914, the then Secretary of the Interior issued a public notice and order, declaring that there would be no increase in the construction charges against the lands.
8
9
Respondents and their predecessors, it is alleged, have fully complied with the terms of the Reclamation Act and all obligations in connection with their water rights, and have paid to the government all sums due on account of construction charges, and all operation and maintenance charges, and have acquired vested water rights sufficient to beneficially and successfully irrigate their lands—namely, acre feet of water per acre per annum; and that such water rights are appurtenant to their lands.
9
10
The bill further alleges that in 1930 the Commissioner of Reclamation desired to construct the Cle Elum Reservoir to store water for the irrigation of lands in the Kittitas Reclamation District and other lands, the canal and distributing system in that district being then in process of construction. But finding that the cost of the reservoir would exceed, by $ the amount which would be returned to the reclamation fund, and without consulting respondents or other water users in the Sunnyside Unit of the Yakima Project, the Commissioner charged the sum of $to that unit and district, and informed the Secretary to that effect. Neither respondent nor any other water users in that unit or district ever agreed to this arrangement; but the then Secretary certified to the President that provision had been made for the repayment to the reclamation fund of the total cost of the reservoir, and that $thereof was to be obtained by rentals from the Sunny-side Division of the Yakima Project.
10
11
The bill further alleges that the Secretary and other officials agreed with designated persons to attempt to force and coerce respondents, and other water users in the district, to induce the district to agree to pay the additional sum; otherwise, to force and coerce them to sign water-rental applications or be deprived of a portion of the water owned by them. In pursuance thereof, public notice was given and an order issued limiting their rights to 3 acre feet per acre, and exacting a specified rental charge for additional water. Respondents and the other water users were notified that they would be deprived of all water in excess of the 3 acre feet per acre unless they made application for additional water in a form and manner prescribed. Respondents and the other water-right users, however, refused to make such applications.
11
12
It is further alleged that 3 acre feet of water per acre is not, never has been, and will not in the future be sufficient to beneficially irrigate respondents' lands; but would leave a large part thereof barren and nonproductive, thereby forcing about half of their lands to bear construction, maintenance charges, taxes, and assessments upon the whole thereof. The bill shows that irreparable loss and damage will result if the order of the Secretary is enforced; and that respondents have no adequate or complete remedy at law, but that effective relief can be administered only by a court of equity. The prayer is for a decree requiring the Secretary to vacate, set aside and hold for naught the notices and orders set forth in and attached to the bill, and that respondents be restored to their former rights and privileges.
12
13
The bill goes into greater detail in respect of the facts; but the foregoing general statement of the allegations is enough for present purposes. Succinctly stated, the case comes to this: The United States, under the Reclamation Act, constructed an irrigation system for the purpose of storing and distributing water for irrigation of arid lands. Respondents own water rights under the system for lands of that kind; and these lands require artificial irrigation to render them productive. So far as these respondents are concerned, the government did not become the owner of the water rights, because those rights by act of Congress were made 'appurtenant to the land irrigated';2 and by a Washington statute, in force at least since were 'to be and remain appurtenant to the land.'3 Moreover, by the contract with the government, it was the land owners who were 'to initiate rights to the use of water,' which rights were to be and 'continue to be forever appurtenant to designated lands owned by such shareholders.'
13
14
Respondents had made all stipulated payments and complied with all obligations by which they were bound to the government, and, long prior to the issue of the notices and orders here assailed, had acquired a vested right to the perpetual use of the waters as appurtenant to their lands. Under the Reclamation Act, supra, as well as under the law of Washington, 'beneficial use' was 'the basis, the measure, and the limit of the right.' And by the express terms of the contract made between the government and the Water Users Association in behalf of respondents and other shareholders, the determination of the Secretary as to the number of acres capable of irrigation was 'to be based upon and measured and limited by the beneficial use of water.' Predecessors of petitioner, accordingly, had decided that acre feet of water per annum per acre was necessary to the beneficial and successful irrigation of respondents' lands; and upon that decision, for a period of more than twenty years prior to the wrongs complained of, there was delivered to and used upon the lands that quantity of water.4 Although the government diverted, stored, and distributed the water, the contention of petitioner that thereby ownership of the water or water rights became vested in the United States is not well founded. Appropriation was made not for the use of the government, but, under the Reclamation Act, for the use of the landowners; and by the terms of the law and of the contract already referred to, the water rights became the property of the landowners, wholly distinct from the property right of the government in the irrigation works. Compare Murphy v. Kerr (D.C.) The government was and remained simply a carrier and distributor of the water (Id.), with the right to receive the sums stipulated in the contracts as reimbursement for the cost of construction and annual charges for operation and maintenance of the works. As security therefore, it was provided that the government should have a lien upon the lands and the water rights appurtenant thereto—a provision which in itself imports that the water rights belong to another than the lienor, that is to say, to the landowner.
14
15
The federal government, as owner of the public domain, had the power to dispose of the land and water composing it together or separately; and by the Desert Land Act of , if not before, Congress had severed the land and waters constituting the public domain and established the rule that for the future the lands should be patented separately. Acquisition of the government title to a parcel of land was not to carry with it a water right; but all nonnavigable waters were reserved for the use of the public under the laws of the various arid-land states. California Oregon Power Co. v. Cement Co., And in those states, generally, including the state of Washington, it long has been established law that the right to the use of water can be acquired only by prior appropriation for a beneficial use; and that such right when thus obtained is a property right, which, when acquired for irrigation, becomes, by state law and here by express provision of the Reclamation Act as well, part and parcel of the land upon which it is applied.
15
16
We are thus brought to the decisive question—Is the United States an indispensable party defendant? If so, the suits, however meritorious, must fail, since no rule is better settled than that the United States cannot be sued except when Congress has so provided; and here that has not been done. Petitioner's contention that the United States is an indispensable party defendant and, as it cannot be sued, the suits should have been dismissed, is based upon the propositions, as we understand them, that the United States is the owner of the water rights; that respondents' claims rest entirely upon executory contracts; and that the relief sought is the substantial equivalent of specific performance of these contracts.
16
17
The fallacy of the contention is apparent, because the thus-far undenied allegations of the bill, as already appears, demonstrate that respondents have fully discharged all their contractual obligations; that their water rights have become vested; and that ownership is in them and not in the United States. The motion to dismiss concedes the truth of these allegations; but even if they were denied, we should still be obliged to indulge the presumption, in favor of the jurisdiction of the trial court, that respondents might be able to prove them. United States v. Lee, cf. Tindal v. Wesley, et seq., In support of his contention, petitioner relies upon American Falls Res. Dist. No. 2 v. Crandall (C.C.A.) but that decision, in so far as it is not in harmony with the view which we have just taken, must be disapproved.
17
18
The suits do not seek specific performance of any contract. They are brought to enjoin the Secretary of the Interior from enforcing an order, the wrongful effect of which will be to deprive respondents of vested property rights not only acquired under Congressional acts, state laws and government contracts, but settled and determined by his predecessors in office. That such suits may be maintained without the presence of the United States has been established by many decisions of this court, of which the following are examples: Noble v. Union River Logging R. Co., Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, Goltra v. Weeks, Work v. Louisiana, Payne v. Central Pac. Ry. Co., These decisions cite other cases to the same effect. The recognized rule is made clear by what is said in the Stimson Case:
18
19
'If the conduct of the defendant constitutes an unwarrantable interference with property of the complainant, its resort to equity for protection is not to be defeated upon the ground that the suit is one against the United States. The exemption of the United States from suit does not protect its officers from personal liability to persons whose rights of property they have wrongfully invaded. * * * And in case of an injury threatened by his illegal action, the officer cannot claim immunity from injunction process. * * *
19
20
'The complainant did not ask the court to interfere with the official discretion of the Secretary of War, but challenged his authority to do the things of which complaint was made. The suit rests upon the charge of abuse of power, and its merits must be determined accordingly; it is not a suit against the United States.'

MORLEY CONST. CO. et al.
v.
MARYLAND CASUALTY CO.*
Argued Jan. 8, 1937.
1
The power of an appellate court to modify a decree in equity for the benefit of an appellee in the absence of a cross-appeal is here to be admeasured.
1
2
Morley Construction Company, a petitioner in this Court, made a contract with the United States, acting by the Veterans' Administration Department for the construction of a veterans' hospital at Batavia, New York. In conformity with statute (C.A. § 270)) it gave a bond for the completion of the contract and for the payment of all bills for material and labor, the respondent Maryland Casualty Company signing the bond as surety. During the progress of the work, the contractor found itself in need of a loan of money to enable it to go on. Accordingly a supplementary agreement was made between the contractor and the surety to relieve the situation. By that agreement, dated April 28, 1933, the contractor agreed to deposit in a designated trust company in Buffalo $to be used in the performance of the work and to deposit in the same account for the same purpose all moneys received from the United States as payments upon the contract. The surety agreed to deposit in the same account $as a loan to be secured by the contractor's note, and additional moneys sufficient to pay the present and future bills of plasterers, amounting, as the evidence shows, to $ The contractor and the surety were to have joint control of the account, and no moneys were to be withdrawn therefrom without the approval of the surety by designated representatives, the approval to be indicated upon the check or draft in writing.
2
3
Following this supplementary agreement, the contractor went on with the work, and brought it to completion. The surety made the first payment of $in accordance with its promise but refused to pay the $owing to the plasterers. In the meantime a series of payments became owing from the Government upon estimates of value in advance of completion and acceptance. Warrants for these payments were forwarded by the Government to the trust company in Buffalo to be placed in the joint account, notice having been given by the contractor to issue them accordingly. However, a different course was followed when the final payment became due. Apparently through inadvertence, the Government sent a warrant for that payment ($ to the contractor itself at its office in Kansas City, Missouri. The contractor endorsed the warrant, delivered it to the Merchants Bank of Kansas City, one of the petitioners in this court, and directed the bank to issue a cashier's check for like amount to the order of the contractor's president. The bank made out the check, but held it to await the payment of the warrant, which it deposited in a Federal Reserve Bank to be forwarded, in the usual course of collection, to the Treasury at Washington. Neither check nor warrant has been paid as a consequence of an injunction obtained by the respondent.
3
4
Upon learning from the Veterans' Administration Department of the transmission of the warrant, the surety began two suits, one in the District of Columbia, where the payment of the warrant was stayed by an injunction, the other the suit at bar. It recounts in its complaint the facts or most of them already stated in this opinion, adding thereto that outstanding bills for more than $are covered by its bond. It says that it is entitled to the specific performance of the supplementary agreement and to a decree depositing the warrant in the trust company at Buffalo to be applied upon the joint account. It says also that by reason of the unpaid bills of materialmen and laborers there is a duty on the part of the contractor to exonerate the surety from loss or liability and to apply the warrant to that purpose. Finally, it makes claim to a right of subrogation to the position of the contractor over against the Government, a claim which apparently has been abandoned and will not engage us further. The bill of complaint ends with a prayer for relief appropriate to the several theories of liability put forward by the pleader, the theory of specific performance, the theory of exoneration, and the theory of subrogation. To render the relief effectual, the bank in Kansas City was joined as a defendant.
4
5
The District Judge held that the surety was not entitled to the specific performance of the agreement, having failed to pay the plasterers and being therefore in default itself. He held, however, that apart from any agreement the contractor was subject to a duty to exonerate the surety from present liabilities. True, there was no purpose on the part of the contractor to divert the proceeds of the warrant from the uses of the contract. As to this the finding is explicit. Even so, a cause of action for exoneration does not include among its elements the presence of a wrongful purpose. Glades County v. Detroit Fidelity Co. (C.C.A.) West Huntsville Cotton Mills Co. v. Alter, Pavarini & Wyne, Inc., v. Title Guaranty & Surety Co., Hutchinson Grocer Co. v. Brand, The decree conforms to the findings in its distribution of relief. It adjudges the complainant to be entitled to exoneration but not to specific performance. The proceeds of the warrant are to be placed in a bank to be chose by the contractor, the deposit to be 'designated as a special trust fund for the payment of bills for labor and material used on the United States Veterans Hospital in Batavia, New York.' No provision is made that the surety, or indeed any one other than the contractor, shall have any control thereof.
5
6
From that decree the contractor appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. There was no cross-appeal by the surety. The Court of Appeals states in its opinion, 'We are in grave doubt whether exoneration can properly be granted.' Preferring by reason of that doubt to put its decision on some other ground, it concludes that there should be specific performance of the supplementary agreement. It concedes that the surety is in default for failing to live up to the agreement strictly, but it finds that the default was not unconscionable or fraudulent, and that a court of equity in its discretion may overlook an unsubstantial wrong. Recognizing the necessity of modifying the decree if exoneration is to be exchanged for specific performance, the opinion states that 'an injunction against using the moneys except as agreed upon, and an order to place said moneys when received in the joint account and disburse the same in payment of just claims for labor or materials, would meet the requirements and rights of plaintiff and would not be impossible of performance' and that 'a decree alone such lines should be granted by the trial court.' Accordingly, the mandate of the appellate court provides that the cause be remanded to the District Court with directions to modify its decree in accordance with the views expressed in the opinion. We granted certiorari to fix the measure of relief available to a non-appealing suitor.
6
7
The substitution of specific performance for exoneration at the instance of the surety was not an affirmance of the decree below, as if the reasons only had been changed with the decision standing firm. Alike in substance and in form there was a modification of the decree itself, the facts being found anew and differently, the law declared anew and differently, and the relief remodeled and adapted to the new law and the new facts. Without a cross-appeal, an appellee may 'urge in support of a decree any matter appearing in the record, although his argument may involve an attack upon the reasoning of the lower court or an insistence upon matter overlooked or ignored by it.' United States v. American Railway Express Co., What he may not do in the absence of a cross-appeal is to 'attack the decree with a view either to enlarging his own rights thereunder or of lessening the rights of his adversary, whether what he seeks is to correct an error or to supplement the decree with respect to a matter not dealt with below.' Ibid. The rule is inveterate and certain. Canter v. American & Ocean Insurance Co., Chittenden v. Brewster, The Maria Martin, 251; Field v. Barber Asphalt Co., Landram v. Jordan, Union Tool Co. v. Wilson, Peoria & Pekin Union Ry. Co. v. United States, Langnes v. Green, Alexander v. Cosden Co., Findings may be revised at the instance of an appellant, if they are against the weight of evidence, where the case is one in equity. This does not mean that they are subject to like revision in behalf of appellees, at all events in circumstances where a revision of the findings carries with it as an incident a revision of the judgment. There is no need at this time to fix the limits of the rule more sharply. 'Where each party appeals each may assign error, but where only one party appeals the other is bound by the decree in the court below, and he cannot assign error in the appellate court, nor can he be heard if the proceedings in the appeal are correct, except in support of the decree from which the appeal of the other party is taken.' The Maria Martin, supra.*

8
The surety laid claim to relief upon the basis of a contract, and to other relief by force of an equitable doctrine independent of contract. The decree of the District Court rejected the first claim because the contract had been broken, and accepted the second because the breach was then irrelevant. The decree was responsive to the claim that had been accepted, and not to any other. If there was to be specific performance of the contract, the surety, together with the contractor, would control the distribution of the fund, for so the parties had agreed. If there was to be exoneration and nothing more, the contractor or perhaps the court would control the application and the surety would stand aside. Stulz-Sickles Co. v. Fredburn Construction Corporation, A. cf. Glades County v. Detroit Fidelity Co., supra; Arant, Suretyship, pp. and cases cited. Exoneration 'does not entitle the surety to custody or control of the fund.' Stulz-Sickles Co. v. Fredburn Construction Corporation, supra. The decision of the Court of Appeals puts an end to this nice adjustment of the relief to the law and of the law to the facts as found. A decree appropriate to exoneration is annulled, and one appropriate to specific performance is given in its place. This is to find the facts anew and differently, for the trial judge had held, at least by implication, that the breach by the surety, viewed in the light of all the circumstances, was something more than unsubstantial. It is to find the law anew and differently, for the trial judge had held that a surety chargeable with such a breach was not entitled to a decree upon the footing of the contract. Even more important, it is to give a new measure of relief, for the trial judge had ruled that the fund was not to be held upon the restrictions stated in the contract, but upon different restrictions orginating in the conscience of the Chancellor. True, the relief proper to the theory accepted at the trial is almost as favorable from the view-point of the protection of the surety as the one adopted on appeal, though distinctly less burdensome from the view-point of the principal. Exoneration is not the same as specific performance, but it is not very different, and may be nearly, if not quite, as good. This is surely not a reason why an appellate court should be at liberty to treat the two as interchangeable. One might as well say that at the instance of a non-appealing plaintiff a judgment for specific performance could be made to take the place of one for the recovery of damages.
8
9
The decree should be reversed and the cause remanded to the Court of Appeals to pass upon the question, not yet definitively answered, whether relief in the form of a decree for exoneration is proper in the circumstances, and for other proceedings in accord with this opinion.

Reversed.

KNOX NAT. FARM LOAN ASS'N et al.
v.
PHILLIPS.
Argued Jan. 14, 15, 1937.
1
The controversy in this case makes it necessary to determine the remedies available to a shareholder in an insolvent farm loan association upon the refusal of a demand for the retirement of his shares.
1
2
Respondent is the owner of a farm in Knox county, Ohio. His vendors were members of the Knox National Farm Loan Association, a co-operative membership corporation chartered under federal law. Federal Farm Loan Act, July C. § C.A. § . Through that association they procured a loan from the Federal Land Bank of Louisville, giving a mortgage as security. Part of the proceeds of the loan (i.e., 5 per cent. thereof) they used for the purchase of stock in the co-operative association, there being a requirement of the statute that 'any person desiring to borrow on farm land mortgage through a national farm loan association shall make application for membership and shall subscribe for shares of stock in such farm loan association to an amount equal to 5 per centum of the face of the desired loan, said subscription to be paid in cash upon the granting of the loan.' Federal Farm Loan Act, § ; cf. § . The statutory plan has already been expounded in opinions of this court. Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., Federal Land Bank v. Gaines, Federal Land Bank v. Priddy. 
2
3
Upon the purchase of the farm by respondent in October, 1927, he assumed the payment of the mortgage debt, succeeding at the same time to the interests of his vendors in the stock of the association and to the attendant liabilities. The shares were of the par value of $ They had been pledged with the association, in accordance with the requirements of the statute (section ) as security for the loan. The association on its part had subscribed for an equal amount of the shares of the federal land bank, the lender of the money, leaving the shares so subscribed for as a pledge for the security of the lender. This too was a procedure called for by the statute. Section . From time to time thereafter there were payments on account, with the result that the loan had been reduced by March, at which time respondent made an effort to clear the farm of the mortgage and to put an end also to his liability as shareholder. To that end he paid the association $to be transmitted to the bank, insisting that the deficiency ($ be satisfied through the retirement of the shares. The bank accepted the payment as one upon account, but refused to discharge the mortgage without payment of the balance. At that time, by concession, the association was insolvent. Its capital was impaired; it was indebted to the bank upon other mortgage loans, being liable as indorser or otherwise when it borrows for a member (Federal Land Bank v. Gaines, supra); it had no moneys in its treasury wherewith the shares could be retired.
3
4
The courts took up the controversy. Respondent joined the bank and the association as defendants in a suit in the court of common pleas of Knox county, Ohio. He prayed for judgment against the bank that the mortgage be held to have been canceled and extinguished and for judgment against the association that the shares of stock be paid off and retired, and that the business of the association be wound up and liquidated. For answer, the bank and the association took the ground that the partial payment made was insufficient to discharge the mortgage; that there could be no retirement of the shares while the association was insolvent; that the state court was without jurisdiction to liquidate the business of the association, an instrumentality of the federal government; and that jurisdiction in that behalf resided in the federal government exclusively.
4
5
Two decrees were rendered by the court of common pleas. The first, filed October 7, 1935, provides that the mortgage lien shall be canceled by the bank upon tender by the plaintiff of $in addition to the payment previously made, the tender to be kept good by payment into court. The second, filed November 18, 1935, directs the farm loan association to retire the respondent's shares, and gives him judgment against the association for the par value thereof. It appearing that the association was unable to pay the judgment by reason of insolvency, a receiver was appointed to take possession of the assets and liquidate the business, the association of its officers being required forthwith, upon the demand of the receiver, to surrender any property in their possession or under their control. From the decree of November 18, the defendants prosecuted an appeal to the Ohio Court of Appeals,** which affirmed with an opinion. A petition for review by the Supreme Court of the state was submitted and denied. We granted certiorari ( —-) to set at rest far-reaching questions as to the meaning and administration of an important act of Congress.

At the outset a doubt as to our jurisdiction calls for scrutiny and judgment. The case being here after a decision of a state court, jurisdiction is not given us unless the decree to be reviewed is final. Judicial Code § . Respondent has been adjudged entitled to the payment of a specific sum of money, but he is also to have a receiver who is to liquidate a business, the court reserving the right to control the conduct of its officer and to rescind or modify its order. Does the appointment of a receiver postpone the stage of finality until his work is at an end?

The primary purpose of the suit was the recovery of a judgment for the par value of the shares. Any other relief prayed for or awarded was tributary to that recovery; it was a form of equitable execution to make collection possible. When the amount invested in the stock was adjudged to constitute a debt, whatever folloed in the decree was auxiliary and modal. The association and its officers were not directed to account, and to surrender what was found owing at the close of the accounting. They were directed to make delivery and to make delivery at once. We think they were subjected to a present obligation as immediate and absolute as if the assets were to be wrested from them by execution directed to the sheriff. Winthrop Iron Co. v. Meeker, St. Louis, I.M. & S.R. Co. v. Southern Express Co., Thomson v. Dean, 94; McGourkey v. Toledo & Ohio Central Ry. Co., Collins v. Miller, Chase v. Driver (C.C.A.) City of Des Moines v.

Accepting jurisdiction, we are brought to a consideration of the merits.

A national farm loan association is a co-operative enterprise. Its members must subscribe for its shares to the extent of 5 per cent. of the loan to be procured in their behalf. Federal Farm Loan Act, § . The association in its turn, upon the procurement of the loan, subscribes to stock of the land bank to an equivalent extent. Section . With few exceptions, the only assets which a farm loan association has or can have are the shares which it takes in the federal land bank to counter-balance the shares of its own stock taken by he borrower, together with dividends distributed by the bank, and reasonable charges for necessary expenses, not in excess of '1 per centum of the amount of the loan applied for.' Byrne v. Federal Land Bank, as amended subd. 3). To add to the protection of the bank and other creditors, the shareholders in the association are chargeable under the law as it stood at the date of these transactions with personal liability up to a designated maximum. 'Shareholders of every national farm loan association shall be held individually responsible, equally and ratably, and not one for another, for all contracts, debts, and engagements of such association to the extent of the amount of stock owned by them at the par value thereof, in addition to the amount paid in and represented by their shares.' Section Upon evidence that an association has failed to meet its obligations the Farm Credit Administration may declare it insolvent and appoint a receiver, subject to the proviso that this shall not be done until the total defaults shall amount to at least $in the federal land bank district, unless such association shall have been in default for a period of two years. Section C.A. § . There shall be no voluntary liquidation without the consent of the supervising federal authority. Section C.A. § .
9
10
The background has now been indicated against which we must view the question whether a member of an association who has paid his loan in full may have his shares retired and recover their par value when the association is insolvent. In support of such a recovery respondent relies upon two sections of the statute. By section ) an association borrowing from a land bank 'shall subscribe for capital stock of said land bank to the amount of 5 per centum of such loan,' the stock to be held by the bank as collateral security. By the same section, such stock (i.e., the stock of the land bank) shall be 'paid off and retired upon full payment of the mortgage loan.' If that is done, 'the national farm loan association shall pay off at par and retire the corresponding shares of its stock which were issued when said land bank stock was issued.'2 Complimentary to that section is section C.A. § 733)), which regulates the relation between the association and its members. Upon applying for a loan, the applicant 'shall subscribe for shares of stock in such farm loan association to an amount equal to 5 per centum of the face of the desired loan,' the subscription at his election to be paid out of the proceeds, and the stock to be held by the association as collateral security. 'Said capital stock shall be paid off at par and retired upon full payment of said loan.' Id.
10
11
These provisions for retirement, despite their apparent breadth, are not to be extended to a situation such as the one before us here, and this for two reasons.
11
12
In the first place, section 8 of the statute, as already pointed out, is complementary to section 7. We are to read the two together. The association is not to retire its own shares and repay to the subscriber the amount of his subscription until the land bank has retired the corresponding shares of bank stock subscribed for by the association, and has paid back to the association the par value thereof. Only thus can the association be put in funds wherewith to make payment to its own subscribers. The record makes it plain, however, that this indispensable condition has never been fulfilled. The bank refuses to retire the shares of bank stock subscribed for by the association upon the loan to the respondent, or to refund the subscriptions wholly or in part. The scheme of the statute would be fatally disrupted if the association could be held when the bank refused to pay.
12
13
In the second place, neither the bank nor the association is under a duty to retire stock when the association is insolvent, and thus to give to the withdrawing member through the return of his subscription a preference over others. The statute is misread if the sentences regulating withdrawal are taken out of the setting of a co-operative scheme and viewed in isolation. Under the law as it stood when respondent became a member, the shareholders were subjected to a personal liability for all the contracts, debts, and engagements of the association 'to the extent of the amount of stock owned by them at the par value thereof, in addition to the amount paid in and represented by their shares.' Section . The association is already in default in the payment of its mortgage debts, and already its capital is impaired. In such circumstances, to return to respondent the amount paid in and represented by his shares would frustrate the statutory mandate that the amount so paid in shall constitute a fund for the benefit of creditors to be supplemented in case of need by personal liability for as much more as the investment. Indeed, altogether apart from any pledge of personal liability, the whole structure of the association is built upon the implication of equal rights and duties on the part of the co-operating members. To permit a member to withdraw when the association is insolvent would be to cast upon his fellow members the responsibility for defaults for which all should answer ratably in proportion to their interests. To guard against that inequity the statute makes it clear that shares in the association shall not be subject to retirement until the corresponding subscriptions to the land bank have been canceled and refunded. We are not required to determine whether a member of an association will have rights enforceable against the bank when the association has been wound up in accordance with the federal statute. Cf. section 29, as added by Act March . No such question is before us. Enough for present purposes that in the existing situation, with insolvency conceded, the shares of the association are not subject to withdrawal.
13
14
The conclusion thus arrived at is in accord with well-considered opinions in North Dakota and Arkansas where the same question was involved. Byrne v. Federal Land Bank, supra; Western Clay National Farm Loan Ass'n v. Lilly, S.W.( It has the support of persuasive analogies in the law of building and loan associations, which have much in common with farm loan associations incorporated by act of Congress. The settled rule is that the shares of building and loan associations are not subject to retirement when the association is insolvent, and that any refund made at such a time may be reclaimed by a receiver. Towle v. American Bldg., Loan & Inv. Society (C.C.) Sullivan v. Stucky (C.C.) Coltrane v. Balke (C.C.A.) Aldrich v. Gray (C.C.A.) Christian's Appeal, Colin v. Wellford, Am.St.Rep. cf. Fidelity Savings & Loan Association v. Burnet. 
14
15
In holding that a judgment for the par value of the shares is inconsistent with the federal statute and impliedly forbidden, we cut the ground away from the auxiliary receivership, which must fall with the judgment it was intended to enforce. To this we add, however, that a national farm loan association is an instrumentality of the federal government; that the time and manner of liquidation are governed by the federal statute; and that jurisdiction does not reside in the tribunals of a state to wind up the business of this governmental agency either by a receivership or otherwise. Sections C.A. §§ ; Federal Land Bank v. Priddy, supra, at pages Cook County National Bank v. United States, Easton v. Iowa, Jennings v. F. & G. Co., Brusselback v. Chicago Joint Stock Land Bank (C.C.A.) Partridge v. St. Louis Joint Stock Land Bank (C.C.A.) Boyd v. Schneider (C.C.A.) .
15
16
Whether the respondent may vote upon his stock, after his mortgage has been paid in full, until the shares have been redeemed, and whether he has a remedy to compel the Farm Credit Administration to liquidate the business promptly, are questions that have been considered in the briefs, but that do not call for answer upon the record now before us.
16
17
The decree should be reversed and the cause remanded to the Court of Appeals of the State of Ohio for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

The following is the text of the section as embodied in section of the United States Code: 'Whenever any national farm loan association shall desire to secure for any member a loan on first mortgage from the Federal land bank of its district it shall subscribe for capital stock of said land bank to the amount of 5 per centum of such loan, such subscription to be paid in cash upon the granting of the loan by said land bank. Such capital stock shall be held by said land bank as collateral security for the payment of said loan, but said association shall be paid any dividends accruing and payable on said capital stock while it is outstanding. Such stock may, in the discretion of the directors, and with the approval of the Farm Credit Administration, be paid off at par and retired, and it shall be so paid off and retired upon full patment of the mortgage loan. In such case the national farm loan association shall pay off at par and retire the corresponding shares of its stock which were issued when said land bank stock was issued.' C.A. § 721).

300 U.S. 203
AMERICAN LIFE INS. CO.
v.
STEWART et al. (two cases).
Argued Jan. 15, 1937.
1
In these cases suits have been brought for the cancellation of policies of life insurance on the ground of fraud in their procurement, the policies providing that they shall cease to be contestable unless contest shall be begun within a stated time. The question to be determined is the existence, in the circumstances, of a remedy in equity.
1
2
On February 23, 1932, petitioner, a Colorado corporation, issued to Reese Smith Stewart, a citizen of Kansas, two policies of life insurance, each for $ one payable to his son, who is a respondent in No. and the other payable to his wife, who is a respondent in No. Each policy contains a provision that it 'shall be incontestable, except for nonpayment of the premium, after one year from its date of issue if the Insured be then living, otherwise after two years from its date of issue.' On May 31, 1932, three months and eight days after obtaining the insurance, the insured died, having made in his application fraudulent misstatements, or so the insurer charges, as to his health and other matters material to the risk. On September 3, 1932, the insurer brought suit to cancel the insurance, a separate suit for each policy, the executrix of the insured being joined as a defendant with the respective beneficiaries. The complaint in each suit refers in a paragraph numbered 8 to the provision that the policy shall be incontestable after the lapse of two years. In the same paragraph it states in substance that the beneficiary may delay the commencement of the action at law till the time for contest has gone by, or, beginning such an action within the period, may afterwards dismiss it and then begin anew. The insurer asks the court to act while yet the barrier is down.
2
3
On september the defendants moved in each suit to dismiss the bill for want of equity. On October 11, 1932, the beneficiaries began actions at law in the same court to recover the insurance. On October 29, the insurer filed its supplemental bills setting forth the pendency of the actions at law, and praying an injunction against their continued prosecution. On July 28, 1933, the District Court denied the motions to dismiss, without passing, however, on motions made by the insurer to enjoin the actions at law. On August 29, a stipulation was signed and filed in each case that 'the suit in equity shall be tried' by the court 'before said law action is tried, Provided, however, that the issues in said law action shall in the meantime be made up in order that said law issues thus joined shall stand ready for trial, with the understanding that said law issues, if any remain for trial, shall be tried as soon after the trial of the suit in equity as the court shall determine,' and this stipulation was approved by the court and an order made accordingly. On October 10, 1933, the defendants in each of the equity suits filed their answers to the bills, denying the fraud, admitting the making of the 'incontestability clause' as stated in paragraph 8, and as to the other allegations of that paragraph denying any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief. The answers did not state that the remedy at law was adequate.
3
4
Upon the trial of the suits in equity, the District Court found the fraudulent representations charged in the complaints, and decreed the cancellation and surrender of the policies. There was an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, where the decree was reversed, one judge dissenting, the court holding that the insurer had an adequate remedy at law. We granted certiorari to settle an important question, and one likely to recur, as to the scope of equitable remedies.
4
5
No doubt it is the rule, and one recently applied in decisions of this court, that fraud in the procurement of insurance is provable as a defense in an action at law upon the policy, resort to equity being unnecessary to render that defense available. Enelow v. New York Life Ins. Co., Adamos v. New York Life Ins. Co., Phoenix Mut. L. Insurance Co. v. Bailey, Cable v. United States Life Ins. Co., That being so, an insurer, though the victim of a fraud, may commonly stand aside and await the hour of attack. But this attitude of aloofness may at times be fraught with peril. If the policy is to become incontestable soon after the death of the insured, the insurer becomes helpless if he must wait for a move by some one else, who may prefer to remain motionless till the time for contest has gone by. A 'contest' within the purview of such a contract has generally been held to mean a present contest in a court, not a notice of repudiation or of a contest to be waged thereafter. See, e.g., Killian v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., New York Life Ins. Co. v. Hurt (C.C.A.) Harnischfeger Sales Corp. v. National Life Ins. Co. (C.C.A.) Accordingly an insurer, who might otherwise be condemned to loss through the mere inaction of an adversary, may assume the offensive by going into equity and there praying cancellation. This exception to the general rule has been allowed by the lower federal courts with impressive uniformity.1 It has had acceptance in the state courts.2 It was recognized only recently in an opinion of this court, though the facts were not such as to call for its allowance. Enelow v. New York Life Ins. Co., supra, at page 3
5
6
The argument is made, however, that the insurer, even if privileged to sue in equity, should not have gone there quite so quickly. Six months and ten days had gone by since the policies were issued. There would be nearly a year and a half more before the bar would become absolute. But how long was the insurer to wait before assuming the offensive, and how was it to know where the beneficiaries would be if it omitted to strike swiftly? Often a family breaks up and changes its abode after the going of its head. The like might happen to this family. To say that the insurer shall keep watch of the coming and going of the survivors is to charge it with a heavy burden. The task would be hard enough if beneficiaries were always honest. The possibility of bad faith, perhaps concealed and hardly provable, accentuates the difficulty. There are statements by judges of repute which suggest a possibility that the contest barrier may stand though the holder of the policy has gone to foreign lands. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Panagiotopoulos (C.C.A.) There are statements that it will stand though an action at law, brought within the period, has been dismissed or discontinued later. See New York Life Ins. Co. v. Seymour (C.C.A.) Harnischfeger Sales Corp. v. National Life Ins. Co. (C.C.A.) New York Life Ins. Co. v. Truesdale (C.C.A.) with which contrast New York Life Ins. Co. v. Miller (C.C.A.) Thomas v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., ) and Powell v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., Whether such statements go too far we are not required to determine, for a slight variance in the facts, as, e.g., in the rule prevailing in the jurisdiction where the final suit is brought, may have a bearing on the conclusion. At least in such warnings there are possibilities of danger which a cautious insurer would not put aside as visionary. 'Where equity can give relief, plaintiff ought not to be compelled to speculate upon the change of his obtaining relief at law.' Davis v. Wakelee, To this must be added the danger that witnesses may disappear and evidence be lost. A remedy at law does not exclude one in equity unless it is equally prompt and certain and in other ways efficient. Boyce's Executors v. Grundy, 655; Drexel v. Berney, Walla Walla v. Walla Walla Water Co., Union Pac. R. Co. v. Board of Com'rs of Weld County, 'It must be a remedy which may be resorted to without impediment created otherwise than by the act of the party.' Cable v. United States Life Ins. Co., supra, at page Here the insurer had no remedy at law at all except at the pleasure of an adversary. There was neither equality in efficiency nor equality in certainty nor equality in promptness. 'The remedy at law cannot be adequate if its adequacy depends upon the will of the opposing party.' Bank of Kentucky v. Stone (C.C.) cf. Lincoln National Life Ins. Co. v. Hammer (C.C.A.) To make a contract incontestable after the lapse of a brief time is to confer upon its holder extraordinary privileges. We must be on our guard against turning them into weapons of oppression.
6
7
The argument is made that the suits in equity should have been dismissed when it appeared upon the trial that after the filing of the bills, and in October, 1932, the beneficiaries of the policies had sued on them at law. But the settled rule is that equitable jurisdiction existing at the filing of a bill is not destroyed because an adequate legal remedy may have become available thereafter. Dawson v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., Lincoln National Life Ins. Co. v. Hammer, supra; New York Life Ins. Co. v. Seymour, supra. There is indeed, a possibility that the bringing of actions of law might have been used by the respondents to their advantage if they had not chosen by a stipulation to throw the possibility away. A court has control over its own docket. Landis v. North American Co., December 153. In the exercise of a sound discretion it may hold one lawsuit in abeyance to abide the outcome of another, especially where the parties and the issues are the same. Id. If request had been made by the respondents to suspendthe suits in equity till the other causes were disposed of, the District Court could have considered whether justice would not be done by pursuing such a course, the remedy in equity being exceptional and the outcome of necessity. Cf. Harnischfeger Sales Corp. v. National Life Ins. Co. (C.C.A.) There would be many circumstances to be weighed, as, for instance, the condition of the court calendar, whether the insurer had been precipitate or its adversaries dilatory, as well as other factors. In the end, benefit and hardship would have to be set off, the one against the other, and a balance ascertained. Landis v. North American Co., supra. But respondents, as already indicated, gave that possibility away. They stipulated that the issues in equity should be tried in advance of those at law, and that only such issues, if any, as were left should be disposed of later on. The cases were allowed to stand as if challenge to the suits had been made by a demurrer only. So challenged, they prevail.

'The instant case is not one in which there is resort to equity for cancellation of the policy during the life of the insured and no opportunity exists to contest liability at law. Nor is it a case where, although death may have occurred, action has not been brought to recover upon the policy, and equitable relief is sought to protect the insurer against loss of its defense by the expiration of the period after which the policy by its terms is to become incontestable.'

AMERICAN PROPELLER & MFG. CO.
v.
UNITED STATES.
Argued March 12, 1937.
1
This is a proceeding brought in the Court of Claims by petitioner to recover a balance of $alleged to be due from the government under certain designated contracts. The government filed a general traverse, an a counterclaim for a deficiency income and excess profits tax assessment in the sum of $ The taxes were for the year and were assessed on the 14th day of June, 1924. The court below found that the government was indebted to petitioner upon the contracts in the sum of $ Upon the counterclaim the court found that the tax liability of petitioner was $ Upon this latter sum, it allowed interest, at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum from the date of assessment, in the sum of $ bringing the total allowance upon the counterclaim to the sum of $ Judgment was given against petitioner for the difference between that sum and the sum due under the contracts; namely, $ The opinion of the court will be found in and a supplemental opinion in the form of a memorandum was filed on October We granted certiorari, limited to the question of the allowance of interest to the government upon its counterclaim. —-.
1
2
In the argument here, both parties proceed upon the theory that interest was allowed under the Revenue Act of e).1 The government contended below that under that section it was entitled to interest at the rate of 1 per centum per month instead of 6 per centum per annum. It abandons that contention here, but insists that it is entitled to at least the interest allowed by the court below.
2
3
It will be seen that under the findings, the government was indebted in 1924 to petitioner in the sum of $ against which there was at the same time a just counterclaim of $ so that, if the account had been adjusted at that time instead of 12 years later, the government would have been obliged to pay petitioner the difference between these two sums, or $ The inequity of allowing the government interest for 12 years under these circumstances, so as to bring the petitioner in debt to the government in the sum of over $ is so gross as to be shocking.
3
4
We have said (United States v. The Thekla, : 'When the United States comes into Court to assert a claim it so far takes the position of a private suitor as to agree by implication that justice may be done with regard to the subject matter. The absence of legal liability in a case where but for its sovereignty it would be liable does not destroy the justice of the claim against it. * * * The reasons are strong for not obstructing the application of natural justice against the Government by technical formulas when justice can be done without endangering any public interest.' If the principle thus stated is not strictly applicable, it at least suggests that the court should not affirm what is clearly an unjust and inequitable result unless under plain compulsion of law.
4
5
Section e), supra, provides for the allowance of interest where the tax remains unpaid after the date when it is due and 'for ten days after notice and demand by the collector.' The court below found that on June 14, 1924, the Commissioner made the assessment 'and duly notified plaintiff with regard thereto.' It made no other finding in respect of that matter. The government contends that the finding which was made means that the Commissioner set in motion the normal administrative machinery which resulted in a notice demanding payment, and relies upon the presumption of official regularity as being sufficient to make this finding the equivalent of a finding of notice and demand by the collector. Pacific States Box & Basket Co. v. White. 
5
6
But we are dealing here not with a presumption, but with a specific finding; and that finding should be examined in the light of the pleadings. Luckenbach S.S. Co. v. United States, The amended counterclaim of the government, filed in 1927, among other things, alleges that 'the Commissioner of Internal Revenue made an additional assessment' of which the plaintiff (petitioner) was duly notified. The collector is not mentioned and no demand is alleged. Considering the finding in connection with the allegation, the former fairly may be construed as comprehending all that was done in attempted compliance with the condition imposed by section e) as a prerequisite to the allowance of interest. But this is not all that appears.
6
7
In the memorandum supplementing the original opinion, the court below said: 'The record fails to show that any demand was made, and we cannot presume that it was. On the contrary, in view of the fact that plaintiff at the time was claiming that the defendant was indebted to it in a sum larger than the amount of the tax, it is more probable that no such demand was made.' While it is true that this court is not at liberty to refer to the opinion for the purpose of eking out, controlling or modifying the scope of the findings,2 the rule is not absolute and does not preclude reference to the opinion for all purposes whatsoever. It is well established that in case of ambiguity, extrinsic aid may be sought in order to settle the meaning of a statute or a contract. We see no reason why the principle of that rule does not permit reference to the opinion of the court in order to clarify the meaning of a finding otherwise in doubt. The government suggests that in such case the proper course is to remand the case to the Court of Claims in order that that court may supplement and clarify the finding and, if necessary, take additional evidence to that end. Of course, that sometimes has been done; but where, as here, the finding, the pleadings, and the opinion of the court, taken together, clearly show that section e) in the particular under consideration was not complied with, it is unnecessary to follow that procedure.
7
8
This proceeding was originally brought in 1922. The deficiency assessment was made while the case was pending. The counterclaim of the government was first filed in 1926, and an amended counterclaim in 1927. Under these circumstances we see no reason for remanding the case upon the mere chance that the government may be able to furnish evidence which it has failed to furnish during more than a decade of litigation, and especially in respect has failed to furnish during more than a frankly conceded to be inequitable.
8
9
The judgment should be reversed with directions to enter judgment for petitioner, without an allowance of interest upon the counterclaim, in accordance with the foregoing opinion. So ordered.

UNITED STATES
v.
MADIGAN.
Argued March 10, 1937.
1
Respondent brought this suit in the District Court for Southern California to recover total permanent disability benefits under a contract of war risk term insurance. While in the military service of the United States in the World War, he acquired a term policy of war risk insurance. On November 1, 1919, availing himself of the benefits of section of the War Risk Insurance Act of October he converted his term insurance into a twenty-payment life policy of United States government insurance. He paid premiums on this policy until January 31, 1920, when it was allowed to lapse for nonpayment of premiums. On the date of the conversion of his first policy, he was suffering from a 'compensable disability,' and, after the lapse of the second, on June 6, 1925, he was rated by the Veterans' Bureau as totally and permanently disabled. At that time he was entitled to disability compensation from the government in the sum of $.
1
2
On the trial in the District Court a jury was waived and the case was heard on an agreed statement of facts. The court gave judgment for the respondent for permanent disability benefits under his first policy, with respect to so much of the insurance as the $of disability compensation, remaining uncollected at the time of total permanent disability, would have purchased if applied to the payment of premiums due upon the original policy between the date of its conversion and the date of total disability. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that respondent was entitled, under sections of the World War Veterans' Act (38 C.A. §§ , to revive the original term insurance and to recover under it the permanent disability benefits awarded by the trial court. We granted certiorari, —-, because of the importance of the decision of the Court of Appeals, which conflicts with the consistent rulings of the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs, and affects, adversely to the government, a large number of pending insurance claims.
2
3
Section of the World War Veterans' Act of June as amended July C.A. § 516), applies to lapsed, canceled, or reduced insurance policies. It provides:
3
4
'Where any person has heretofore (prior to June 7, 1924), allowed his insurance to lapse, or has canceled or reduced all or any part of such insurance, while suffering from a compensable disability for which compensation was not collected and dies or has died, or becomes or has become permanently and totally disabled and at the time of such death or permanent total disability was or is entitled to compensation remaining uncollected, then and in that event so much of his insurance as said uncollected compensation, * * * would purchase if applied as premiums when due, shall not be considered as lapsed, canceled or reduced; and the United States Veterans' Bureau (Veterans' Administration) is hereby authorized and directed to pay to said soldier, or his beneficiaries, as the case may be, the amount of said insurance.'
4
5
Section as amended July C. § C.A. § 518), relates to all insurance policies 'heretofore or hereafter issued, reinstated, or converted.' It declares that all such policies shall be incontestable and provides:
5
6
'That the insured under such contract or policy may, without prejudicing his rights, elect to make claim to the bureau (Veterans' Administration) or to bring suit under section 19 of this Act (section of this title) on any prior contract or policy, and if found entitled thereto, shall, upon surrender of any subsequent contract or policy, be entitled to payments under the prior contract or policy.'
6
7
Respondent elected to claim under his original policy, presumably because the rate of premiums for the term insurance was lower than for the twenty-payment life policy, and the $of disability compensation would purchase a larger amount of the former type than of the latter. The government admits that the respondent is entitled, under section to revive the twenty-payment life policy which has lapsed, but contends that he is not entitled to revive the earlier term insurance which he had converted, because section omits any reference to converted insurance, such as appears in section .
7
8
All war risk policies were required to be for term insurance by section of the War Risk Insurance Act, but that section permitted conversion of the insurance into other forms, after termination of the war. When Congress desired to legislate about one form of insurance thus changed into another, it explicitly used the descriptive term 'converted.'1 The omission of any reference to converted insurance in section indicates that the privilege of reviving a lapsed, canceled, or reduced policy, was not intended to extend to an earlier policy converted into another, whose lapse is the condition of the revival. Such must be taken to be the meaning if it is consistent with the purposes of the section, disclosed by its legislative history and with the provisions of other sections.
8
9
The legislative history supports the government's argument that from the beginning the aim of the legislation later embodied in section was to permit the veteran to revive his policy when he had allowed it to lapse, for want of funds, at a time when there was money due him from the government for a compensable disability. The supposition was that he would have paid the premiums on the lapsed policy if he had then received the sum due from the government—a supposition which is inadmissible if, at that time, he had converted low premium term insurance into any of the other forms of insurance commanding a higher premium, as permitted by section .
9
10
In its original form, section appeared as a part of section of the War Risk Insurance Act, added by the Act of August The bill which became section as originally reported by the House Committee, provided for the reinstatement by disabled veterans of their lapsed and canceled policies. In recommending this legislation, the Committee of the House having it in charge pointed out that most such lapses and cancellations occurred at a time when disability compensation was due to the veteran, and were probably occasioned by lack of funds.2 The bill was amended on the floor of the House3 so as to include the provisions later elaborated into section They permitted the revival of a lapsed policy in favor of the beneficiaries of a deceased veteran, if, at the time of the lapse, he had been entitled to money from the government for a compensable disability.4 The proviso, upon which revival was conditioned, that at the time of the lapse compensation be due from the government to the veteran, made more explicit the purpose indicated in the Committee Report.5
10
11
As then adopted, the revival provision applied only to lapsed policies, but as amended by the Act of July , it was extended to include 'canceled or reduced' insurance. This amendment was adopted for the purpose of avoiding a ruling of the Comptroller General that the phrase 'lapsed insurance' did not embrace canceled or reduced insurance, even though the cancellation or reduction occurred at a time when compensation was owing to the veteran. See Report of House Committee, No. t Sess., pp. 7, 8; Hearings before Senate Finance Committee, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., on H.R. Neither the words nor the legislative history of section suggest that the phrase 'canceled or reduced insurance' was intended to include insurance elsewhere described in the act as 'converted,' at least unless the conversion was accompanied by a reduction of the policy. The like administrative construction which has consistently been given to the section by the Veterans' Bureau6 is of persuasive force. Norwegian Products Co. v. United States, Brown v. United States. 
11
12
The other sections of the act are consistent with this construction of section permits the insured, if totally disabled, to make claim under his converted policy and entitles him to the benefits of that policy 'if found entitled thereto.' See United States v. Arzner, But it is plain that respondent is not 'entitled' to total disability benefits under the original policy, within the meaning of section because the total disability did not occur until after its conversion. Section does not, either by its terms or by reasonable implication, extend the privileges of section to converted insurance. The legislative history of section does not disclose any purpose to amend section or to depart from its policy, and in any case the modification by implication of the settled construction of an earlier and different section is not favored. United States v. Munday, Ibanez v. Hongkong Banking Corporation, The right of respondent to revive his insurance is limited to the lapsed twenty-payment life policy.

299 U.S. 353
DE JONGE
v.
STATE OF OREGON.
Argued Dec. 9, 1936.
1
Appellant, Dirk De Jonge, was indicted in Multnomah County, Or., for violation of the Criminal Syndicalism Law of that State.1 The act, which we set forth in the margin, defines 'criminal syndicalism' as 'the doctrine which advocates crime, physical violence, sabotage, or any unlawful acts or methods as a means of accomplishing or effecting industrial or political change or revolution.' With this preliminary definition the act proceeds to describe a number of offenses, embracing the teaching of criminal syndicalism, the printing or distribution of books, pamphlets, etc., advocating that doctrine, the organization of a society or assemblage which advocates it, and presiding at or assisting in conducting a meeting of such an organization, society or group. The prohibited acts are made felonies, punishable by imprisonment for not less than one year nor more than ten years, or by a fine of not more than $ or by both.
1
2
We are concerned with but one of the described offenses and with the validity of the statute in this particular application. The charge is that appellant assisted in the conduct of a meeting which was called under the auspices of the Communist Party, an organization advocating criminal syndicalism. The defense was that the meeting was public and orderly and was held for a lawful purpose; that, while it was held under the auspices of the Communist Party, neither criminal syndicalism nor any unlawful conduct was taught or advocated at the meeting either by appellant or by others. Appellant moved for a direction of acquittal, contending that the statute as applied to him, for merely assisting at a meeting called by the Communist Party at which nothing unlawful was done or advocated, violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.
2
3
This contention was overruled. Appellant was found guilty as charged and was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years. The judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State which considered the constitutional question and sustained the statute as thus applied. The case comes here on appeal.
3
4
The record does not present the evidence adduced at the trial. The parties have substituted a stipulation of facts, which was made and filed after the decision of the Supreme Court of the State and after the Chief Justice of that court had allowed the appeal and had directed transmission here of a certified transcript of the record. We do not approve of that practice, where it does not appear that the stipulation has received the approval of the court, as we think that adherence to our rule as to the preparation of records is important for the protection of the court whose decision is under review as well as of this court. See rule C.A. following section . But, as the question presented in this instance does not turn upon an appreciation of the facts on any disputed point, we turn to the merits.
4
5
The stipulation, after setting forth the charging part of the indictment, recites in substance the following: That on July 27, 1934, there was held in Portland a meeting which had been advertised by handbills issued by the Portland section of the Communist Party; that the number of persons in attendance was variously estimated at from that some of those present, who were members of the Communist Party, estimated that not to exceed 10 to 15 per cent. of those in attendance were such members; that the meeting was open to the public without charge and no questions were asked of those entering, with respect to their relation to the Communist Party; that the notice of the meeting advertised it as a protest against illegal raids on workers' halls and homes and against the shooting of striking longshoremen by Portland police; that the chairman stated that it was a meeting held by the Communist Party; that the first speaker dwelt on the activities of the Young Communist League; that the defendant De Jonge, the second speaker, was a member of the Communist Party and went to the meeting to speak in its name; that in his talk he protested against conditions in the county jail, the action of city police in relation to the maritime strike then in progress in Portland, and numerous other matters; that he discussed the reason for the raids on the Communist headquarters and workers' halls and offices; that he told the workers that these attacks were due to efforts on the part of the steamship companies and stevedoring companies to break the maritime longshoremen's and seamen's strike; that they hoped to break the strike by pitting the longshoremen and seamen against the Communist movement; that there was also testimony to the effect that defendant asked those present to do more work in obtaining members for the Communist Party and requested all to be at the meeting of the party to be held in Portland on the following evening and to bring their friends to show their defiance to local police authority and to assist them in their revolutionary tactics; that there was also testimony that defendant urged the purchase of certain communist literature which was sold at the meeting; that while the meeting was still in progress it was raided by the police; that the meeting was conducted in an orderly manner; that defendant and several others who were actively conducting the meeting were arrested by the police; and that on searching the hall the police found a quantity of communist literature.
5
6
The stipulation then set forth various extracts from the literature of the Communist Party to show its advocacy of criminal syndicalism. The stipulation does not disclose any activity by the defendant as a basis for his prosecution other than his participation in the meeting in question. Nor does the stipulation show that the communist literature distributed at the meeting contained any advocacy of criminal syndicalism or of any unlawful conduct. It was admitted by the Attorney General of the State in his argument at the bar of this Court that the literature distributed in the meeting was not of that sort and that the extracts contained in the stipulation were taken from communist literature found elsewhere. Its introduction in evidence was for the purpose of showing that the Communist Party as such did advocate the doctrine of criminal syndicalism, a fact which is not disputed on this appeal.
6
7
While the stipulation of facts is but a condensed statement, still much of it is irrelevant in the light of the particular charge of the indictment as construed by the Supreme Court. The indictment charged as follows:
7
8
'The said Dirk De Jonge, Don Cluster, Edward R. Denny and Earl Stewart on the 27th day of July, A.D., in the county of Multnomah and state of Oregon, then and there being, did then and there unlawfully and feloniously preside at, conduct and assist in conducting an assemblage of persons, organization, society and group, to wit: The Communist Party, a more particular description of which said assemblage of persons, organization, society and group is to this grand jury unknown, which said assemblage of persons, organization, society and group did then and there unlawfully and feloniously teach and advocate the doctrine of criminal syndicalism and sabotage, contrary to the statutes in such cases made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the state of Oregon.'
8
9
On the theory that this was a charge that criminal syndicalism and sabotage were advocated at the meeting in question, defendant moved for acquittal, insisting that the evidence was insufficient to warrant his conviction. The trial court denied his motion, and error in this respect was assigned on appeal. The Supreme Court of the State put aside that contention by ruling that the indictment did not charge that criminal syndicalism or sabotage was advocated at the meeting described in the evidence, either by defendant or by any one else. The words of the indictment that 'said assemblage of persons, organization, society, and group did then and there unlawfully and feloniously teach and advocate the doctrine of criminal syndicalism and sabotage,' referred not to the meeting in question, or to anything then and there said or done by defendant or others, but to the advocacy of criminal syndicalism and sabotage by the Communist Party in Multnomah County. The ruling of the state court upon this point was precise. The court said, at page :
9
10
'Turning now to the grounds for a directed verdict set forth in defendant's motion therefor, we note that he asserts and argues that the indictment charges the assemblage at which he spoke with unlawfully and feloniously teaching and advocating the doctrine of criminal syndicalism and sabotage, and elsewhere in the same motion he contends that the indictment charges the defendant with unlawfully and feloniously teaching and advocating said doctrine at said meeting. The indictment does not, however, charge the defendant, nor the assemblage, at which he spoke, with teaching or advocating at said meeting at 68 Southwest Alder street, in the city of Portland, the doctrine of criminal syndicalism or sabotage. What the indictment does charge, in plain and concise language, is that the defendant presided at, conducted and assisted in conducting an assemblage of persons, organization, society, and group, to-wit, the Communist Party which said assemblage of persons, organization, society, and group was unlawfully teaching and advocating in Multnomah county the doctrine of criminal syndicalism and sabotage.'
10
11
In this view, lack of sufficient evidence as to illegal advocacy or action at the meeting became immaterial. Having limited the charge to defendant's participation in a meeting called by the Communist Party, the state court sustained the conviction upon that basis regardless of what was said or done at the meeting.
11
12
We must take the indictment as thus construed. Conviction upon a charge not made would be sheer denial of due process. It thus appears that, while defendant was a member of the Communist Party, he was not indicted for participating in its organization, or for joining it, or for soliciting members or for distributing its literature. He was not charged with teaching or advocating criminal syndicalism or sabotage or any unlawful acts, either at the meeting or elsewhere. He was accordingly deprived of the benefit of evidence as to the orderly and lawful conduct of the meeting and that it was not called or used for the advocacy of criminal syndicalism or sabotage or any unlawful action. His sole offense as charged, and for which he was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for seven years, was that he had assisted in the conduct of a public meeting, albeit otherwise lawful, which was held under the auspices of the Communist Party.
12
13
The broad reach of the statute as thus applied is plain. While defendant was a member of the Communist Party, that membership was not necessary to conviction on such a charge. A like fate might have attended any speaker, although not a member who 'assisted in the conduct' of the meeting. However innocuous the object of the meeting, however lawful the subjects and tenor of the addresses, however reasonable and timely the discussion, all those assisting in the conduct of the meeting would be subject to imprisonment as felons if the meeting were held by the Communist Party. This manifest result was brought out sharply at this bar by the concessions which the Attoney General made, and could not avoid, in the light of the decision of the state court. Thus, if the Communist Party had called a public meeting in Portland to discuss the tariff, or the foreign policy of the government, or taxation, or relief, or candidacies for the offices of President, members of Congress, Governor, or state legislators, every speaker who assisted in the conduct of the meeting would be equally guilty with the defendant in this case, upon the charge as here defined and sustained. The list of illustrations might be indefinitely extended to every variety of meetings under the auspices of the Communist Party although held for the discussion of political issues or to adopt protests and pass resolutions of an entirely innocent and proper character.
13
14
While the States are entitled to protect themselves from the abuse of the privileges of our institutions through an attempted substitution of force and violence in the place of peaceful political action in order to effect revolutionary changes in government, none of our decisions go to the length of sustaining such a curtailment of the right of free speech and assembly as the Oregon statute demands in its present application. In Gitlow v. People of State of New York, under the New York statute defining criminal anarchy, the defendant was found to be responsible for a 'manifesto' advocating the overthrow of the government by violence and unlawful means. Id., at pages In Whitney v. People of State of California, under the California statute relating to criminal syndicalism, the defendant was found guilty of willfully and deliberately assisting in the forming of an organization for the purpose of carrying on a revolutionary class struggle by criminal methods. The defendant was convicted of participation in what amounted to a conspiracy to commit serious crimes. Id., at pages The case of Burns v. United States, involved a similar ruling under the California statute as extended to the Yosemite National Park. Id., at pages On the other hand, in Fiske v. Kansas, the criminal syndicalism act of that State was held to have been applied unconstitutionally and the judgment of conviction was reversed, where it was not shown that unlawful methods had been advocated. Id., at page See, also, Stromberg v. People of State of California. 
14
15
Freedom of speech and of the press are fundamental rights which are safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. Gitlow v. New York, supra, at page Stromberg v. California, supra, at page Near v. Minnesota, Grosjean v. American Press Co., The right of peaceable assembly is a right cognate to those of free speech and free press and is equally fundamental. As this Court said in United States v. Cruikshank, 'The very idea of a government, republican in form, implies a right on the part of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs and to petition for a redress of grievances.' The First Amendment of the Federal Constitution expressly guarantees that right against abridgment by Congress. But explicit mention there does not argue exclusion elsewhere. For the right is one that cannot be denied without violating those fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all civil and political institutions principles which the Fourteenth Amendment embodies in the general terms of its due process clause. Hebert v. Louisiana, Powell v. Alabama, Grosjean v. American Press Co., supra.
15
16
These rights may be abused by using speech or press or assembly in order to incite to violence and crime. The people through their Legislatures may protect themselves against that abuse. But the legislative intervention can find constitutional justification only by dealing with the abuse. The rights themselves must not be curtailed. The greater the importance of safeguarding the community from incitements to the overthrow of our institutions by force and violence, the more imperative is the need to preserve inviolate the constitutional rights of free speech, free press and free assembly in order to maintain the opportunity for free political discussion, to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people and that changes, if desired, may be obtained by peaceful means. Therein lies the security of the Republic, the very foundation of constitutional government.
16
17
It follows from these considerations that, consistently with the Federal Constitution, peaceable assembly for lawful discussion cannot be made a crime. The holding of meetings for peaceable political action cannot be proscribed. Those who assist in the conduct of such meetings cannot be branded as criminals on that score. The question, if the rights of free speech and peaceable assembly are to be preserved, is not as to the auspices under which the meeting is held but as to its purpose; not as to the relations of the speakers, but whether their utterances transcend the bounds of the freedom of speech which the Constitution protects. If the persons assembling have committed crimes elsewhere, if they have formed or are engaged in a conspiracy against the public peace and order, they may be prosecuted for their conspiracy or other violation of valid laws. But it is a different matter when the State, instead of prosecuting them for such offenses, seizes upon mere participation in a peaceable assembly and a lawful public discussion as the basis for a criminal charge.
17
18
We are not called upon to review the findings of the state court as to the objectives of the Communist Party. Notwithstanding those objectives, the defendant still enjoyed his personal right of free speech and to take part in a peaceable assembly having a lawful purpose, although called by that party. The defendant was none the less entitled to discuss the public issues of the day and thus in a lawful manner, without incitement to violence or crime, to seek redress of alleged grievances. That was of the essence of his guaranteed personal liberty.
18
19
We hold that the Oregon statute as applied to the particular charge as defined by the state court is repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The judgment of conviction is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
